Have been playing it for over a month. However, I have reached a point in the last TWO WEEKS where I cannot play the levels because the ads do not allow me to continue. They show up, and I have waited as much as five minutes, but they don’t “end.” The only options are “learn more” or close. If I close it, the level doesn’t begin and I’m stuck at the level selection screen AGAIN! Even if I hit learn more and come back to the app, the ad doesn’t let me play the level. I have been stuck for such a long time. This is also the case for the final fantasy ad. Even if I play the entire mini game, when I close the ad the level does not start, and I’m back at the level selection screen... I want to finish the story but I cannot progress as much as one level. Please change the types of ads you have. add more of the 30 second video ads because those are the ONLY ads that allow me to progress. I will give five stars if someone can tell me how to get past these ridiculous ads or the developers offer ads that will allow me to continue playing. Thank you.Edit: About three days after I wrote the review, more video ads were added. Thank you for your feedback, I am sorry to hear of this issue. Can you please ensure you are connected to stable wifi and try reloading the game. If you continue to have trouble please write us at ghos@gamehouse.com with more information so that we can help you out (please mention the game, the bug, what device you play on and the iOS version it runs). Thanks for your help! Kind regards,GameHouse I FREAKING LOVE THE GAME!!! I missed the fan hanging on the ceiling for level 51-60 and I just realized that. Below is false alarm, I’m really sorry. The game is awesome and the story line is very intriguing, too. Again, below is my mistake, I’m really sorry for this and sorry to whoever is replying me.)Thank you.I thought I bought all the upgrades, but I still couldn’t earn the Daniel trophy which says “63 out of 64 upgrades bought”. After finishing all the games I cannot enter any shops before the game and I can’t buy anything, I don’t even know which upgrade I’m missing. I really don’t want to restart the game all over to buy the upgrade, I hope u guys can fix that. Otherwise, everything’s perfect, this is a great game!!! Thanks for your feedback. Could you please write us at ghos@gamehouse.com with more information so that we can help you out (please mention the game, the bug, what device you play on and the Android version it runs). Thanks for your help!Kind regards,GameHouse I will admit, when I read the reviews, I was worried.  I had NEVER seen in the history of Gamehouse seen a game I didn’t love.  Nay sayers be darned.  This game is free to play!  HELLO?!  Am I the only one who saw that?  Granted, for the obsessive players, this could be a bit of a deterrent; however, then pay for the power ups and not the game.  Amazing story.  My poor Daniel—I am rooting for his recovery.  If you have a ‘history’ with this game—no, I’m not creepy, but I am a writer, and I appreciate stories where I can develop an understanding/RELATIONSHIP of the characters. Well, Gamehouse just made that accessible to all.  Stop your whining.  It is EXACTLY what we have come to expect from Gamehouse and our sweet, courageous Heart.

I wanted a cheap alternative to Minecraft. But, honestly, don’t cheap out and buy this one. After my experience with this demo it really doesn’t appeal to the audience of Minecraft. It doesn’t have the expectations Minecraft does. I can understand that Microsoft is a big company and can push updates regularly, and come up with many unique things in their game like the Nether, the marketplace with community created maps, behavior packs, music, texture packs and so much more! For a couple extra dollars, you can have an overall better experience. Don’t cheap out on this game, it just isn’t really worth it compared to its competitor. I wouldn’t say this is a direct ripoff, either. I would rather label it as “inspiration.” Now I’ve played most god these games and I love them, but I’m gonna suggest some more things to enhance the game.Try to add ruined military operations from the USSR and the US, like adding tanks, destroyers (RARE), and (LEGENDARY) an bomber or jet fighter, I know this is kinda modern but it adds a lot of history of what might of happened on a area.(Add submarines if possible too please) And also add more guns, like a AA turret to get rid of NPC fighters, (this is rare and they might take you to a somehow operational base, unless they think ur hostile, (don’t hold a weapon) and also add MG guns and old WWII rifles and assault rifles, this will enhance how much u can use to defend a area.Last suggestion : add NPC soldiers, boats, and planes. And a radio, also some medical equipment. This will give a challenge if they are allies with you and they could help you out somehow. But be warned, some will be hostile if you hold a weapon. Unless they already met you and know ur safe. And I’m done with the ideas. But dev if your reading this thank you for creating these games and I hope you take my ideas, I also hope it’s not too much for the game and too much to ask. So I love this could you add flint & steel and steel armor also add s a shield and iron gold diamond netherite and add enchanted books anvils and a portal that leads to the nether and another that leads to the enter dragon and add seed for it and add it to where it is not very hard add a tutorial when you are new to the game from building a house or a camp site on survival and add a bell and villages and more furniture like a switch that connects to a nearest lamp and add lamps to the game Like the one in the actual Minecraft that’s not copy right make your own bell that’s way different from the bell Actual bell that’s cool and add five nights at freddys and servers and multi player where you click play it has worlds friends servers multiplayer worlds.

‎Grand Theft Auto V: The Manual,"GTAV: The Manual is the official manual app for Grand Theft Auto V. Contains over 100 pages covering everything from Game Controls, and Features to a tour through the local neighborhoods and activities across Los Santos and Blaine County - plus a special interactive version of the game map to zoom in and explore. Developed by series creators Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto V is available worldwide for PlayStation®4, PlayStation®3, Xbox One®, Xbox 360® and PC. Set in the biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game’s three lead characters. When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other. All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto’s darkly humorous take on modern culture. Grand Theft Auto V also comes with Grand Theft Auto Online, the dynamic and ever-evolving Grand Theft Auto universe for multiple players. With the expansive game world and fluid mechanics of Grand Theft Auto V as a foundation, Grand Theft Auto Online expands and evolves with regular content updates created by Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto community. With assistance from characters from the story of Grand Theft Auto V, players rise through the criminal ranks by banding together with friends to complete Jobs for cash, purchase properties, vehicles and character upgrades, compete in traditional competitive modes such as Deathmatches or Races by land, air or sea, or create your own content to play and share with the Grand Theft Auto community.

An application where users can read about the game, the characters, the settings, the music, tutorial guides and more. Not only is this app informative but the aesthetics are high quality with a sleek streamline interface, navigation to each section is made easy with a pop up menu on the right side and text that is easy to read although for those who can't see that well it would be nice to have customization. From the start the app sets you on the right course as you choose what platform you are playing the game on and what language it is set in. From there you are able to explore the app as you see fit. There is a good wealth of content included in the application concerning information of all kind. The only area that I can tell that could use more data is Grand Theft Online. Maybe in the future this section will be beefed up. Besides that the app seems to fire on all cylinders. If you are a owner of this game, you need to own this manual. I think that this is a great manual especially when using the map feature.  It is helpful for finding various things that are not shown on the in game map like police stations.  I especially like the satellite feature for the map to actually see what the map looks like instead of the gps style map in the game.  Don’t listen to the children that give this low scores because they thought it was the real game.  If you don’t know what a manual means, then you shouldn’t play a 17+ game. This manual is an ultimate guide into the great and grand world of Grand Theft Auto V. Every single person who owns the game shall own this! It feels incredible to play the game and just click on the app whenever you need to check something out like the map. It really helps you know the game a little bit more and explore Los Santos and Blaine County. There is literally nothing else to say about this but that it will definitely help you throughout you playing the Story Mode or even I believe Online. Get it, it’s FREE!

Thanks! I do hope that the game will be updated with more content and incentives besides hats etc. Hope that one day you guys will create a complete super Mario land clone ;) It's a fun little game. I've always liked platformers like this. The problem I have with this game is it's is somewhat glitchy. I often run into invisible walls and sometimes I get sunk into the ground. If you are jumping from the edge of a platform, it will not allow you to jump twice,  assuming that the jump was already on its second jump. In the 12th level, I keep getting stuck between the rail and the ground when I am riding in the rail cart... then I die and have to start the whole level over again.  Little things like that can ruin a game. I hope they improve this game, because I really do like it and it is worth a play through even with the glitches.

Overall, I enjoyed my short time with this game. Sometimes a loss felt out of my control, but at least the Continue system is generous. Some interesting twists in combining combat with pinball, but there’s a limited amount of content and depth here. Would enjoy new content in the future. As is, a fun way to kill a few hours. Great concept, love the Game Boy Pocket grayscale art style, and there are plenty of different screens/tables to keep me entertained. However, this game is almost impossible to play because the left flipper only works about half the time, and it’s nothing but infuriating. Also, the pause button and magnifying glass button are in a terrible location on the screen; they’re right where I want to have my thumbs to use the flippers. And the fact that the magnifying glass icon starts highlighting itself every time you enter a new screen because it wants you to press it and read about the goals in the room is super annoying. Why would I want to stop the action to read the goals? Either make the goals more apparent without instruction (which I actually think they are, so it’s redundant) or have the goals flash on screen like every other video pinball game on the market.This has the potential to be a really fun game, but between the ONLY action input not working properly, and some questionable design and UI choices, I’ll probably never be able to actually enjoy it.Definitely do not recommend this game in its current state. A fun game... when it works. As other reviewers have said, there is an issue with the flippers not registering being tapped which is really frustrating. Also, there is a magnifying glass that appears in the lower left corner that you can tap on to tell you what tasks you need to perform, but the game doesn’t pause when you do so you’ll most likely lose your ball. Also frustrating. It’s a shame cause it’s a fun concept but until these bugs and issues are fixed, I’d stay away.

I played the entire game in a bit over an hour..... but only because I'd played Monument Valley before. I can't begin to understand the 3-dimensional thinking involved to create something like this.Nice game! Obviously inspired by the monument valley games. (I was kind of hoping to see that they’d been mentioned in the credits somewhere.) The story is okay, but needs some polishing for sure. It would be nice to have something a bit more fleshed out than the relatively cliche “civilization gets rekt by computers” thing. Although I did appreciate the attempt to make the narrative less abstract, I can’t help but feel like something important is missing there. The graphics are very nice, the music is soothing, and I got a couple hours of puzzle solving from this game. I can’t quite give it five stars because, although this game is enjoyable as a stand-alone experience, it really does pale in comparison to the monument valley series. Ok..so when I first saw this, I couldn’t believe someone had ripped off Monument Valley app... it’s a simpler version. Having said that, if you loved MV, then you will enjoy getting to do these type of puzzles again! Not too difficult, and overall-its  relaxing and enjoyable. I would love the developers to explain how they were able to develop a version that is SO similar to MV? I think that will satisfy many potential players. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

The only reason I told her not to do it was because it was too complicated for a 4 year old (also little kids can be traumatized by anything). I do believe this is an amazing. The pixel art is fantastic and the gameplay is well made. While playing the game, I have only run into two problems. First, when I first saw the opening cutscene, I noticed it ran on its own so I let it roll on. My phone fell asleep halfway through the cutscene. I’m unsure if you can control that but it would be nice anyway. The second problem - and the more important one - is when you gain a heart or soul heart right as you take a hit that kills Molli. What will happen is the death animation plays, but it doesn’t take you out of the game. In fact, you can still move Molli around in her one-sprite form all you want, since the game thinks you’re dead nothing harms you. The problem is that the game will never truly register an outcome, for it thinks the character is both dead and alive. The only way to escape is to exit to main menu, getting rid of any experience the run gave. I have had this happen to me at least twice and it has frustrated me all the same. If this could be fixed, I would greatly  approve This enticing and challenging game has had me playing it over hours and hours. The story has a quirky and define shape throughout the game. I enjoy the animation and general aesthetic that emanates from the art style and gameplay. The games levels of difficulty inspire me to work harder to get more upgrades and get better weaponry. The extra quests and interaction between characters add to the depth. But one thing kind of bums me out was the expectation that there will be more modes and levels to fuel my love for this but it ended so prematurely and how it was kind of short sparked a kind of sadness that I wanted to try to resolve because this game seems simple but I enjoyed it and I would love there to be more for me and others. I highly recommend this game among a lot of games on my phone. Love this game, my friends saw me playing it on the bus, and now they love this game, too. I'd say my mare gets issue with the game is bugs but  most of them were fixed in this latest update. Although I do have a few suggestions (I don't know where to leave them so I guess i'll just leave them in this review)-buff curses, I often have no reason to pick any of them up, simply because there'll be candies that are literally just better in every way(especially the undead curse, because if you have enough hearts, it puts you in a WORSE position)-add a way to track NPC quests-add some way so you can find out which enemies are which! I often find myself with a quest that requires me to kill a number of some type of enemy, yet I never have an idea which enemy it is.

‎Around The World in 80 Days - Hidden Object Games,"You will travel round the world with the Jules Verne heroes.  Each scene is a new continent, a new country or a new town where you will find yourself in the atmosphere of this region thanks to the picturesque and colourful graphics and the unique musical background.  Fogg's journey with his servant Passepartout begins in England, then he travels to France, Egypt, India, China, Japan, America and other countries.  Phileas Fogg took a wager that he could travel around the world from west to east in 80 days. Along the way he faces many dangers.

Oktober 2020,"At the moment, there aren’t any huge flaws with this game. Story is kinda generic, but not terrible. The one flaw I’m seeing so far is that the narrative subtitles tend to go by really fast, even if I’m not touching the screen. Makes it really hard to experience the story when the dialog subtitles whiz by at the speed of light, especially when there is no voice acting for 75% of the dialog. This game is decent at best in its current form could be way better. So far what I like is the combat I like real time more than turn based. The characters are pretty likable from I played so far I’m in CH3 in the story. That being said the voicing seems lack luster it started strong voicing almost everything then most of CH2 was barely voiced. There’s no timers for the recharge on stamina or pvp flags that’s a bit bothersome. I don’t quite like the pricing for draws either 750 seems a bit much for only getting 9 gems per stage I know it’ll all add up but content will eventually run dry. PVP is auto based in a straight line just sit back and watch your team win as you get to pick who you face. Gacha seemed fairish? I got a character every 10 pull but they were 3 star I also didn’t check the rates so that’s kinda my fault. Gathering mats seems tedious that’s with most CR promoted games tho. Overall I’ll give this game a chance but I won’t hold my breathe hopefully things change a little like the timer I mentioned earlier but it’s been 2 days I’m the first written review? I don’t think that holds too well for this game.Edit: There is no refill over time for stamina... so the only way to get more is by leveling up your account (Which feels like it takes for ever.) and buying stamina refills (Which is 25 gems per refill?)... this is a horrible business tactic It’s 2020 and we’re taking 20 steps back into poor decisions. The game is not bad. The characters and story are interesting and the graphics are decent. The main thing that I do not like is the combat. The battles require a lot of skill early on and you quickly hit walls. The real time action is nice, but there are many issues: Large enemy attacks are hard to dodge and happen too quickly, especially when there is several enemies and things to watch. Also, the camera follows the leader, meaning that you can lose track of your other characters and have to switch leaders to see what is happening with each character. While this isn’t too bad, I wish that the camera could be zoomed out. The controls are also not the best and can be unresponsive at times. The result of these issues combined is that a team of 100,000 battle rating can lose against a 60,000 battle rating stage. Overall, the game is fun, but I think it should be a bit easier for users to fight. Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

My internet is slow so it sometimes glitches a bit but I can’t complain, overall it’s one of the best online survival games ever. I enjoy playing with friends and creating things and I don’t mind if they are destroyed because I can always rebuild and that’s the fun of it😄 I just have a few suggestions on different things you could add in the future: flying animals; there are no creatures that fly in the sky, I think it would be fun if there were bats or something that attack you. I love a challenge! Or maybe be able to shoot down birds with a bow when you hunt instead of shooting chickens that sit on the ground. Water creatures; I know adding these things make it more like Minecraft but if you don’t make them look or act exactly like the Minecraft mobs it wouldn’t seem like the same game, can we pls have a fishing option to make a rod and go fishing?! What is the point of the water if there isn’t anything living in it! Anyway I have other ideas but I don’t want to bother! Great job with this game it beats all! Thx! I absolutely love this game! But the glitches are driving me nuts the lucky blocks are really fun but most of the time it spawns witches and skeletons with full chain armor. Please raise the probability in getting something good. Another thing is that I can’t seem to change from creative to survival or survival to creative please fix this it’s bugging a lot. I also think that the spiders in the game should not have potions like invisibility. For some reason I can’t go through the portal every time I try it doesn’t take me anywhere. It’s very strange. I want to be able to craft more items like soul sand or something like that. I also HATE that behind every diamond there is freaking lava! I don’t want my diamonds to disintegrate. The chances of you actually finding diamonds is very VERY low. I also don’t understand why there are emeralds in creative but they don’t exist in survival. Other than that the game is REALLY REALLY REALLY glitchy. I swear my cousin almost lost his diamond cause he couldn’t move and a freaking zombie was attacking! I wish I could give this five stars but these glitches are making me change my rating by the way i love the new update for enchanting thank you for reading I hope you see this and fix the things the thing I want most is to change from creative to survival and survival to creative. Dear customer!Please, send your cousin our contact(sergey.levchuk@solverlabs.com) to share a detailed description of the issue, OS version so that we can help her fix all problems. Please explore the world more by foot or teleport through portals to find more minerals. We will take your wishes into attention in future updates! Stay tuned! We hope that you will improve your review. Heyyyy! So I started playing this game because originally I wanted minecraft, but I couldn’t, so I scrolled down and found this game. I thought hmmm okayyy well this will work I guess, and I also thought it would just be a rip-off version of Minecraft, but to this day, I still play it!!! I have been playing for almost 2 years now, and even though this isn’t Minecraft, it’s really good! The only thing that I with there was is horses you can actually ride, and you can make saddles, carrots on sticks, be able to maybe actually become friends with, tame, and ride scorpions and also go fishing. Other than that, I will say that you definitely need to play this great amazing game!! You don’t even need to pay for it, and you can remove ads if you save up enough coins. I am also glad that they don’t pay or influence people to write good fake reviews. Come and totally play this game!!!

There aren’t enough survival games styled like this and I’d love to see this game become more developed because I really think it’ll become a popular game. It does need some work though. The graphics aren’t the greatest but graphics don’t need to be super great for a game like this. You just have to add more in game items and functions. If you need an example game look at Rust it would be the perfect game to get ideas from. Just start with small things like new upgrades for the bases you build, maybe a cave location or something and continue from there as the game gets better and bigger. This game always has a good amount of active people so I know as it gets better it’ll get bigger. I’m honestly excited to see how much better this game gets in future. It’s a great game I love the concept of creating servers and joining them it makes the game more fun because it’s easier to play with friends and meet new people! The things that bother me are that if your hatchet breaks then your basically done for. You can fix this by making the hatchet permanent and you can’t remove it from your inventory even if you die. You can remove the crafting buttons for the hatchet and the problem is fixed! Another thing is that the ammo and arrows don’t do anything I spent so long trying to get ammo for my weapons until I found out that they did nothing, it’s a waste of material and it’s not the best idea to add. Especially if you use coins to buy them (which I don’t) and since coins cost money that’s basically scamming so you might want to get that fixed. And one more thing can you please make it so when you die you only lose some of your inventory. Example: I have a shotgun sticks and a campfire, if I die only take away some of my things like since I have four items maybe take two? And if I have a even amount of items then take half. It’s simpler and it will make the game more fun!! Thank you and I will read your comment if you respond. This game me and my friends love this survival game so much because there’s a lot of stuff to do but we have been looking for a survival game for a long time and this came up we tried and fell in love all the problems we had with it was that we would get furnace glitches, laying on the ground, and we just want more stuff cause when you get all the good items you run out of stuff in the game so please developers please work on more updates I don't  expect you to respond fast and do it we are all going through this together and it will stop eventually but here’s a game to look at to get some ideas this survival game is called rust it’s on steam so look at it and maybe play it and get some  ideas they have a lot of stuff on that game so please look at it and get some  ideas for update on your game thank you for this game it’s good I love it. 😍 ","Survival Simulator, Wladyslaw Jewloszewicz, Games, Simulation, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

From the opening moments of the first chapter, 1979 Revolution is one of the best, most immersive historical narratives I've ever enjoyed. I put it in the same category as VALIANT HEARTS; these games excel as games AND history AND cultural commentary. Player choices lead to surprising outcomes that challenge our moral assumptions and demand a second play through. In short, 1979 Revolution is a work of art, and in my humble opinion, a masterpiece at that. The games industry needs more globally relevant work like this. Cheers to the creators at iNK Stories for bringing this morally challenging, emotionally charged vision of the recent past to life. I've had this game sitting on my phone for months now because I wanted to dedicate my full attention to it. I'm glad I waited. Not only is the game look and feel good, the plot line based on real events is rock solid. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time even though I was controlling the protagonist. I smiled at memories and cried at tough decisions I had made. It's so thorough, I'm extremely excited to see what will happen in playthroughs with different choices. Hands down, the best game I have played on this platform. I love the concept and story. It feels like your in a movie. I love how the game is built around real history and how the history is incorporated into the game. Great graphics. I can tell a lot of time went in to making this game.

Problem is, this is not a game that's easy to translate to iOS.  The controls are awkward, but the worst part is the broken ""sprint"" function.  Good luck trying to get it to work, because there's no consistency to when it does.  It works when it wants to.  The glitches aren't major, but are enough to distract you from the game.  Overall, this could be a great port, but the messy controls almost ruin the experience. At first I want you to have my sincere thanks for bringing this old but very important for its genre game on iOS. But still this port needs some serious improvements. Here are some great suggestions what to fix:- Do something about controls. Make them more adequate. I know you are trying to keep the game the way it was back in 1992, but ,since it's not MS-DOS(PC), I don't think people will complain about few new buttons that would replace some ""older"" ones. That especially goes to the combat part, which is very complicated with touch screen. Not to mention the ""sticking"" moment. Also make menu buttons tappable, not controlled by arrow buttons. If that means you'll have to change menus' layout, then do it. Just keep the art style. Again, this is not PC.- Would be nice if you could bring back the details of all 3D objects. Here they have less of them than in PC version.- Fix the music. Some of music tracks play where they are not supposed to. Music in the beginning actually plays when the doors of Derceto close once Edward/Emily go through them.- It also would be great if you could add voices that read texts(character info, letters, books, notes)For now that is all. I sincerely ask you to consider all these moments and do something about them. Thank you for understanding! Playable on the iPad.  The original game had pretty hard controls.  And it's even harder on the iPad mostly because the controller ""button"" has to be pressed by multiple fingers to be effective.  The double tap to run is very hard to do on a touch screen.  Also to turn while running you cannot slide your thumb to the side buttons to turn.  You can use a second finger to press the left or right buttons, and that makes the game at least playable. But I imagine that would be too difficult to do on an iPhone.  If they lengthened the double tap to run just a bit.. And made it so that the controls would let you turn with a single finger, then this port would be excellent. I still had  fun with it. This was probably the first survival horror game ever. And lead to the games like resident evil.

I'm playing a perpetual night world where getting s full moon is a saving grace. And if you re-enter in the game to get the full moon effect, it doesn't go away after the full moon has past. So if wear pigs are chasing you, they never change back. I'm listing all the negatives here but I've played this game for many hours and enjoying it. Some cons I found:- Cooking and eating is tedious where it takes 5 actions to cook and eat something. And you must have an empty slot. - Hard to attack specific targets. I was attacking some hounds when they were attacking lightning goats. The attack button locked on the goat so both agroed on me. I had to book it out of there. - The build menu is a bit fiddly. Sometimes you can't collapse one section and expand another without exiting first. The game pauses when you open it so it's not a big deal.- Can't really multi task. While I was using the virtual joy stick, I wasn't able to open the map without stopping first. Not a big deal until you are being chaste by a wear pig and trying to find where the beefalo are on the map. The pig killed me because of it. I’m just going to keep this very brief. I’m writing this in the hopes that a developer somehow finds it. Although this game is amazing in every sense of the word And exactly my style...the thing that all of the internet and mostly reddit is complaining about is the fact that, if you were to try to play a song or a podcast of any kind while in the app it will stop your music and will not allow you to resume. It seems like a very small problem but to some it’s a rather big deal. The game is great and interesting, but once you know everything there is to know about the game, seen everything there is to see, and slain every beast possible, it gets boring. That’s just how all games are and there’s nothing can change it. But if you can listen to a podcast or entertainment of any kind, then the game once again becomes very useful. It will function as something for the eyes and hands to do while the ears are otherwise occupied. This not to say that the ambience, FX, and in-game music aren’t enough, it’s just that it gets repetitive and mind numbing after a while. So on behalf of me and the group of fans who love to play a relaxing game with entertaining audio media I ask that you change it. btw wasn’t as brief as I thought ","Don't Starve: Pocket Edition, Klei, Games, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I will say that none of Gluten Free's games work on iPod 4 or lower, but that's as much as I know about compatibility. The noises could be better. The dragon's roar is just... AWFUL, and sounds like its roaring from its arse! As an example, Skyrim dragons have some wicked roars and such, but certainly don't copy off of them! And also, the family's a little glitchy. Like, when they are flying in your home even when they should be walking. Or flying on one of the islands when you are walking. I laugh when a sheep runs off their floating island to escape, just to fall to their death! It would nice if your loot could show up inside your house, like it should the way you have dragons. It would be cool if, when you defeated the ""Dragon King"" (inferior when you're at Lvl 50), you became the Dragon King. Or at least were dubbed as the Dragon King. Other then some other things that others could name, this game is worth the money! I love this game, I can sit around and play this game for hours, days, but there are some problems, When u buy the color white for ur flames, it still won't let u use it, and it says it's still locked, also, I don't think that the castle people, like the Knights, mages, and archers should attack u unless u attack them or the castle first, or roar. The roar is fine except it needs to sound deeper, not as high pitched as it is, and when ur  standing or flying, I don't like how the mate and the baby dragons r flying or standing on top of one another, same thing with the wolf game, also, why is the mate so much smaller than u, its just plan weird, this is an amazing game, but it does need some fixing, so please have an upgrade soon, I also think that there should be more levels, instead of just the one, and when u kill the dragon king, I think you should become the dragon king, the dragons face is shaped weird, but I love it to be honest, this game is worth the money but still, please fix it up 🐉😋❤️😇🐲 K, so my T-Rex family is level 32 and lower and my dragon family is capped at fifty. And I had the dragon game for less time. I do think there's a level imbalance here, I think exp for the dragons should be harder, treasure more challenging to get/prices higher or maybe make the game free so people can use this speedy ""sim"" to get a tantalizing taste of Gluten's games. Still has the white fire bug, but I don't even think I've had this game a week so I doubt it'd be fixed in that short of time. Though I'll still care for my dragon family (I'm the sort of dingus that gets attached to freakin' pixels), but now there's really no place to go with this so it's short lived, too fast or just empty. Would love to see more done with this. Maybe an achievement system. Kill Dragon King x amount of times, get his coloration for your dragon. Kill basilisk x times, get snake pattern armor. Etc. just something to add to this game.

How fast you can level up with the right strategy is cool. There are a few problems though. The first one is how when you take your finger off the joystick, your animal stops. I like the idea but please make an option in the settings if you want that or not. The second problem is when a pterodactyl picks something up then drops it then goes on the ground to kill it, you can’t attack it for about 5 seconds. You just have your head on it forever waiting to hit it. Those are problems and I don’t like it. Here is a suggestion. Make cactus damage stop after pterodactyl. I know the bigger the pterodactyl, the less damage. But it’s annoying how it still hurts you. Make it so 1M xp+ means no damage from cacti. This game is awesome, but no game can be flawless. 4/5 until the problems are fixed First of all, the chat should just be removed because I got told by someone to commit suicide because they tried to kill me and I just went on the land and they couldn’t, second of all, eagles should not be able to drag predators. It’s clearly not fair because I was a tiger and a boa was chasing me. I had low health and some stupid eagle comes in and drags me into the boa which causes me to die. The worst part is that somehow, the eagle got the kill. ( I could tell because they immediately leveled up to crocodile and they were quite small, as if they just turned into eagle )The second reason why the chat should be removed is because there is cussing and people throw rude insults at me and other players, then kill me which makes me cry and think I’m hated by everyone. Now, I don’t think that there should be a giant gem in the lava. Why the lava? It just causes other people to burn and when they try to get out because the gem is gone, what’s the use because they’re obviously going to die. And there’s also glitches and hacks that people use to get lots of XP. Those should 100% be fixed. Next, there should be another animal after the Black Dragon. I really recommend this because I reached 18.2 million XP as a black dragon, but I honestly didn’t see the point since there isn’t anything after the black dragon. There is also a few bugs that should be fixed. This is game is really addictive and fun. There are some problems though. I think this game does NOT need curse words .People have said really mean things and curse words even though kids play this game! I've been called some really mean things. People also put bad words into their names. You should REALLY get rid of that! And what are these clan things like GD and N and Quad. I don't understand those. Curse words are really bad. Please restrict people from saying bad words! And, there is a glitch on mobile when the joystick freezes!!! It is super annoying. I got it once right when I got to kraken! I was killed by a pufferfish!!!! Why can't you fix that glitch!! It made me cry... This game has so many terrible glitches! Also please remove dragons and krakens and yetis to NOT be able to kill each other. Also lower the XP to get to black dragon. I've been Black dragon only ONCE. I tried SO HARD! And guess what? I was tail bit to death by a different black dragon! That's so STUPID! Why would they kill me? There's nothing after black dragon! And why are black dragons able to burn each other?! This game makes me so depressed... Why can't you fix ANY of these things! It's so STUPID! If I could give zero stars, I would. Please fix all these things. I would love for these to fixed and would give five stars. But for now, only one star. Fix these things!!!!!!

Please try and make more games more often so I don’t have to wait and wait and wait for a new one to come out. I love these games so much you have no idea. Thank you for this beautiful Wizard of Oz game. I think this might be my all time favorite. Please make more and soon! ❤️❤️❤️ Once again, I am being generous in giving this game 4 stars instead of 2.  I lost enthusiasm and interest in the game when in one of the puzzles, I knew where answer is and I looked there because it made sense to see them there, but they were blank stare. So I looked for the answer elsewhere until I ended up in a deadlock so I opted for a hint, only to be given by an answer that I already knew, but only this time the dots were suddenly there.  However, I will not discredit the hard work of the developers in putting this game together for all of us to play for free. No hyperbole here - Jammsworks is simply (and obviously IMO) the ⭐️best⭐️ casual escape game developer. As often as they offer new titles one might think the quality would suffer, but each is better than the last. OZ is fantastic  - filled with humor, and follows the story quite nicely...such nostalgia.  Puzzles are about average difficulty, but are cleverly designed and well-integrated into each theme. Every game comes with a note sheet, excellent hint system (which are the only ads) AND a lil’ bonus game for dessert! And all for TRULY free. Genius!

It wasn’t like those games that ruins the first on. But one thing that they should try making better is the graphics, but they will not ruin the game for me. Normally I’m not the one who would complain about the graphics, but these where a understatement. Sometimes you wouldn’t even see the person but hear the talking, or the mouth would move but the chin would. And moving around, my goodness, they way that had it set up in the first one was amazing, with the joystick. But this one you have to tap where you want to make, it make it very difficult to play. Also the game just randomly crashes. And I would blame my iPad but my iPad is new and up to date. But otherwise the game is super super good and if have played the first one, you have to play this one!!! While I love the story, there are significant bugs which prevent me from giving this 5 stars. First, characters are frequently in the wrong locations during cutscenes and conversations, a dragonkin figure is not properly displayed, and David… his jaw movements in episode 1 made him even scarier than he is. Then there’s the control scheme. I liked the scheme from the first Life is Strange, where one half of the screen controls the player character while the other half controls the camera, but you don’t have that option here. Tap to walk somewhere. If you miss the tap target to interact with something, you end up starting to walk away from it, which quickly got annoying. And I didn’t get far into episode 3 before it got crashier than I would have liked. Anyway, story gets 5 stars, but the lack of control scheme options, crashes, and bugs drop the overall rating to 3 stars. I loved the original Life Is Strange. With so many characters and settings, it was hard to get mad over the glitches. (Which there were very FEW of.) But this... This ruins the Life Is Strange feeling. The feeling I get from playing Life Is Strange is wonder. Like telltale games, I constantly wonder what is going to happen next. But with so many errors and mistakes in this game, it makes it hard to ignore them. Like with one section where David’s lips don’t move, yet his jaw moves up and down when he is speaking, and his skin glitches into his eyes! And when I’m in the car with William, It kicks me out of the game when he’s hit by the semi truck. This is not the Life is Strange I fell in love with, and I honesty regret buying this... I wasted 12 bucks on a game that doesn’t even work. Like in the title, this game had good potential, but sadly, it didn’t live up to my standards.

It’s great fun and a great way to do some physical activity. I even purchased the full version not only to get the full features, but to support an amazing AR app. However, therein came the problem. Ground detection. Every time I play with the largest or sometimes even second largest field, every checkpoint I go through, no matter the mode, raises the spots, and has them float higher and higher, to the point where I can’t even see them. The same thing happens to the block enemies. I hope this gets fixed soon, because that’s my favorite mode. It adds a whole new layer of depth past just walking in a shape. This game gives you ways to run around your house while your family laughs. The game offers the wall punch mode we’re you can use your phone as your fist and puck simulated targets, or you can play the other default mode which lets you run in different ways. There is also a 2 dollar premium edition were you can try to run over as many dots as you can. Also you can run over as many dots as you can while blocks are chasing you. You can ALSO have a far distance mode:The game is very fun and give it a try. If you like it, premium is worth it:) I’ve played this game on my sisters phone, but for some reason, when I try to play it on my phone, it says the camera isn’t on for it. I’ve tried many ways to fix it, including: restarting my phone, going into settings and restarting the apps, getting on different WiFi’s and etc. Please Please Please fix this app so I can play on it, or suggest another way to play it.

But the storyline is over too soon. I got a new phone, redownloaded this app, and it's been less than a month and there's no story left (I play whenever there's a lull in the day). And I would've liked more weapons years ago. The minigun and striker are really the only fun and effective weapons to have. On my old phone, I hit level 50 and have been basically raking in money as gameplay. I've almost 6 million dollars and nothing to spend it on except the occasional health boost in the arena or a laser cutter for rare emergencies.Knives would be great, maybe a sword option, I like another commenter's idea about the flamethrower, a sawed-off shotgun, sniper rifle, any of these would work. This game is great, and that can be a problem for the developers because great games need maintenance. We all want an update. I've come to love the minor glitches and integrate 'em as part of the game, so I'm not really concerned about that as much as I am wanting more story and weapons. It's a good game, that's why we want more! Great App! One of the few games like it where one doesn't have to be a big spender to play. Highly recommend it for zombie themed FPS enthusiasts. While overall good gameplay, it's not without its flaws. Would give five star rating if not for one major glitch in the system. Something that could be fixed if one of two things were included in the update: The ability to interrupt the reloading process, or the option to disable said processe's automatic function. In the current version, reloading leaves player unfairly vulnerable to attack: Unable to switch weapons, or use items until the process is complete. Would be more efficient if player had the option to equip alternate weapon or utilize item instead of being forced to wait for current weapon to be reloaded once magazine is depleted. Being able to swap weapons or utilize items during automatic reload process would work as well. The trade-off of having to restart the entire automatic reload process when reequipping the weapon with the spent magazine would it be acceptable, as player would most likely be out of danger by then. Please consider for next update. I really was never into games. So I carefully read all the reviews and they are right very easy to play and a lot of free options to get gold and money for more equipment. I even got a new phone and that was the first thing I downloaded. And if you create an account you can pick up where you left off which is awesome cause I had more then 1000 in money and 300 in gold. Also they have great customer service when it comes to earning gold by downloading another app. I also love that option because most games say they are free and then turn around you get to a certain level and you have to play to continue. They also have many missions option that tell you if it’s easy or hard and they also give you a hint on which weapons are best. And they also have many equipment options and when it comes to guns they tell you how powerful it will be. I can go on and on I really love this game.

‎The Uncertain,"The Uncertain — is an episodic story-driven adventure game set in a post-apocalyptic world.  Features: * 3 hours of gameplay * Beautiful graphics * Immersive atmosphere * Accelerometer Support * Game Center Achievements Imagine making moral choices in a world devoid of morality. Logic rules this world, and every decision is just a set of zeros and ones. Most concepts take a whole new meaning, and some get completely abolished. Luckily reasonable beings, even if not human, always have a choice.  In the first episode you see it from the perspective of an engineering robot RT-217NP, who seems to be very curious about the human race, long extinct in wasting wars.

But then I got up to the room with the security turrets at the lab and what was a puzzle/story/adventure game suddenly requires reflexes that I, someone with a joint disorder, just don’t have. I tried— for hours— to get past that scene, and I watched play throughs, and tried to do what those players did, and I simply physically can’t. Usually when I encounter a game that’s going to need fast, calculated motion, I know it in the first few minutes and can nope out. This reminds me a lot of Life Is Strange in that it’s a game that I was able to play almost to the end and am now stuck because it is asking me to do something that is a physically impossible for me.  If you’re going to create a game where one scene has a radically different gameplay style than the rest, PLEASE either warn up front or have a way for players like me who can’t play in that way to skip the outlier scene. It’s so frustrating to get so invested in a game and then have to just stop without getting to know how it ends because the developers didn’t think about disability access. While I too spun around awhile coming out of the apartment building I was able to get around the glitches and finish the game. This appears to be a new game. The story was entertaining and I definitely think that minor glitches in no way should depreciate the fact that this is a five star game. You can fix glitches but the story/game itself is top notch. To the devs, I use IPad Pro 1st gen. I was stuck a few times in the air ventilation room too. I was able to either shut down to get out or just happen to hit it right. It almost seemed that the exit was off screen. Had there been a place that allowed me to save it, Along with your auto save feature, then I wouldn’t have lost minor progress.  During the airborne sequence it seemed that I had no control at all, I kept smashing into things. Maybe I was supposed to but even when there appeared something at the bottom of the screen I didn’t get it. Perhaps it was just me. The gyroscope is definitely touchy. I learned to slow down to keep it from looping. I wish there was a way to be updated in the game with new chapters (like an update appears that gives you the opportunity to purchase new episodes) as I look forward to purchasing the next one.  I only comment on glitches for your information, habit from beta testing. Thanks for hours and hours of good/fun entertainment. I like this game a lot. However, I am playing on an iPad Air (first gen), and the game crashes at the end of nearly every chapter, forcing me to replay it. The second time through it seems to save progress normally. The crash always seems to happen after the shield symbol “stutters” the second time.Gameplay is great. I love the interface, and moving around is intuitive. I enjoy having to choose the answer at certain moments.

However I saw pretty glowing reviews for it so I gave it a shot. At first, I wasn’t very impressed. Just walking around the woods staring at blank 360 pictures wasn’t doing a lot for me. But then I got to chapter 2 and that’s when the game really started piquing my interest. As I went on the game became very interesting and immersive. Especially wearing noise cancelling headphones. I wish there were more games like this to play on your phone for VR. Great game :) Quite a fantastic game! Tilting your cell phone around and panning for clues to move forward, just brilliant! Have not come a crossed a game quite like it before. The scenes are exceptionally well done. The mansion was awesome, just like those videos of people who search through real abandoned houses. The scenes are creepy and scary, keeps you on your toes waiting for something to happen. And it will, though much of it is psychological scares. It’s best to play with the lights off in the room your in. Makes it more like your really the one walking around seeing it through your cell phone. Very enjoyable game, would recommend this game for anyone who likes creepy, scary games. The only complaint I have is that the game ended too soon, I definitely wanted more!!! Maybe even finding a way to stop the occurrences and defeat the bad entity. Please create a part 2, I would definitely play it over and over again!!! Wow I’m amazed at this this was a perfect horror game it didn’t cross   the boundary’s which I liked, it pushed them no doubt but to a point where it was still fun. It also had a great story and it is so different the fact that you only can see in black and white for the main part and to the caricature of the game. Now hopefully the next game they make will be even better, and if I could meet the people who made this game, no!!, this other dimension. I would ask them if they could bring to life a true encounter that I experienced.

Try going overland across the Great Plains and huge mountain ranges, crossing the Isthmus of Panama, or rounding Cape Horn on the tip of South America.

Trying to drag key from inventory bar keeps pulling down Notification Center. Hard to talk to people who are moving. I thought I’d tapped them but nope I’m looking at the street over and over Good game in need for more forgiving touch controlsPs original fan here. Was exited to play this new edition. I’m rooting for the game..Pps. Funny story. So you’re supposed to keep off the grass in Brooklyn. I tried to talk to the cop, but my character walked across the grass to talk to him. He blew his whistle and said “freeze!” And then the game froze. I love the original Gold Rush. I installed this version on my iPad 3 and iPhone 6. It's really meant for larger screens. The controls are intuitive however your finger completely covers the control options and you need to blindly know what you're trying to do. I failed 20+ times in a row trying to drag my key to the proper spot on the gate. Text is tiny and almost unreadable. On the iPad 3 it was really laggy. Trying to drag items from inventory often result in dragging down the notification bar. I turned off the sound as the voice acting was horrendous. Flat characters that almost sound robotic. I can get past the voices but this really needs to be optimized for smaller screens. All that said, I'm still happy to have it. Gold Rush is always fun to play.Edit: taking away another star. The controls are awful. I keep wishing I was just playing the original. This release just isn't fun to play. Stay away at all cost.  Great graphics, great port; unfortunately, the game is impossible to play on iPhone.  Every time you go to use an item, the IOS pull down screen appears and the item becomes impossible to use.  There is no way you’re going to get anywhere in this game until they figure out another place to put the item menu.  It’s unfathomable to me that this bug made it through testing and still appears in the finished product.  I was really looking forward to playing this game too; but there’s no way to use your key to unlock your front gate which is the first thing you must do in this game.  This game would have a much higher rating from me if it was even semi-playable. ","Gold Rush!

In the update description it says “get all blocks for free” and if you mean basic you haven’t updated anything. Also, it says “VIP track” alone. Please expand on your update descriptions. Also, what’s a VIP track?I would like to add, I was building my house and I had a bridge and a creek kind of south where I was building. I built a huge water slide. After I completed my kitchen, I went outside and saw that the bridge and creek were gone and I only saw a pond and colored staircase made of blocks, not stairs as I used. I chose the largest world (2048x2048) so I should be able to build (2048x2048) but instead it seems like I can go up to 130x450. FIX IT NOW AND ASAP PLEASE! I even read another review about the same thing! We are so sorry you're not enjoying your experience! “get all blocks for free” means that you can collect coins by watching ads, and don't have to pay real money. Therefore, you are able to get all blocks, including premium, for free.Vip track is a subscription based track that gives you ad free experienceIt also gives you double reward including two blocks on special days and more.Again, egarding all free, last version all premium blocks cost real money, right now you can watch videos, get daily reward and get all of the premium blocks without paying one cent.May we ask you to please contact us at support@explorationpro.com and explain the situation in detail? We'd like to improve the game in every aspect so you will have a fun experience with our game. ❤️ It’s just a really bad game do you know why every time and come on there and I start building at my house just a huge chunk has to disappear 24 seven one time I was almost done with my house just about to put in five more blocks and then I look over to my right and I see just a huge chunk of flat wall missing First of all it crashes so much and there needs to be huge update that needs to be mobbed needs to be more nights longer days they need to be just more updating and I want you all  who made this game I more and to let people come on there should be like MPC villagers there should be villages that you can scout out and find and you guys should make it able to show that friends and family can come and play with you because it’s just lonely and he gets a bit longer after a few minutes overall I just think it’s a horrible game and I just think it needs absolutely definitely more updates that’s just my Opinion I’m not sure about yours but I just think this game is absolutely horrible👎🏾 I loved this game when I first got it. I thought it was cool. But don’t let those pictures above these reviews fool you! I thought this was cool also because of the DJ board....SPOILER ALERT! You have to pay with real money for those blocks. And the iPhones and other cool blocks. So watch out, because you have to pay money for the coolest blocks, also, it gets really REALLY REALLY Lonely! There is not even one animal! It gets....how should I put this..... DUMB! I don’t really like this game. Those stars up there, I meant to make it three in a half stars. I am deleting this game.

Add to this no less than two disparate Messianic visions and your basic dystopic bargain, and you’ve got a lot to reflect on by game’s end. The game mechanics are well planned too. While it is always possible to get to a good ending and a bad ending, choices made along throughout the game will determine whether you can get the best ending and the worst ending.  and puzzles drive most of the action, This game is amazing! The music ,art style , and voice acting mesh perfectly together to envelop you in the world if primordia. The somber tone and story elements reminded me a touch of blade runner. I defiantly recommend downloading it. My one critisim is that the controls are not immediately available they appear when you hover over a certain part of the screen you don't get a menu until you find your data pouch ,but I suppose that was intentional to give focus to the landscape of the scene. Overall great game 5 minutes into the game, and I already knew that I was in love. Crispin, your helper, is perfectly witty, and Horatio NullBuilt Version V, was intelligent and a deep character. Right away I was in love with the art, with the curiosity, and I could not bring myself to put the game down. It brought out so much raw emotion in me, and I fell in love over and over again. It was so worth buying, that words can't even begin to explain. The only issue is that it's impossible to get one achievement, but compared the wonder and joy I felt, that's nothing.

It combines old fashioned turn based combat with new ""On the go"" technology that you can play anywhere! The story is flawless and I found myself falling in love with Cynthia. The character depth is amazing and I really felt their emotions.  I would pay anything for a sequel! Overall fun app. Haven't beat it yet working my way through to the overlords keep now.  Will say the touch controls could use better auto tracking but the on the fly controller switching in tight spots makes up for any tap to move issues.  Overall sound and story wins over this minor gameplay issue.  I will say a few things, the double confirm for sales is a bit stale and there is a scroll glitch in the special points shop but its nothing major as you will use shops maybe at most 8 times for weapons and armor and just max stack healing items once or twice.  The game has great difficulty in the beginning up towards mid game then with a few skills and the right orbs its easy to pull off massive damage at a huge risk in damage intake. Pretty balanced overall especially since getting closer to the overlord results in boss battles that need careful planning since super skills damage is no longer as effective with double damage setups.  Keep up the great publishing. ","RPG Journey to Kreisia, Kotobuki Solution Co., Ltd., Games, Adventure, Role Playing, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

That’s all the problems that I can think of as of right now, so please if you can fix this problems it would be great. I’ve just started playing this game and it is amazing, the graphics and the amount of detail is just wow! It’s very competitive and you can really fully costume enjoy your character, the best part of this game is that not all the content is downloaded at once, I like how you have to download stuff because it make the game more smooth and it allows you to play online on hotspot! There’s a lot I like about this game and at this point I’m not having any issues with it but I keep seeing some reviews that are not so great. Keep up the good work! I would also like it if you added more game modes that would introduce the player to a whole other gameplay/game style like mini games such as Capture the Flag or 1v1 solo duel, game modes like that would really be enjoyable to the community, I would also like to point out your rewards because they’re awesome! Lucky royale and daily rewards are probably the best for beginners because it atleast gives good rewards to those who are not that good at the game, unlike fortnite that makes you Pay for their currencies, free fire has several different currencies that get you something u want and you don’t have to pay a single penny to earn, u can just earn the currencies by completing the game and just basically playing the game, I love this game and I would really hope there would be more updates to improve the game style because this game finally makes it fair to everyone with its currencies and gameplay! Edit: As mentioned below Ive lost interest. Its the same thing every game! Go on a kill streak, Game gets serious lag spike i die instantly, and then i level up and get gold but theres nothing to spend it on. Oh yeah and ever since i logged onto FB not only has connection been bad but i haven't been able to select load outs anymore.  This game is great but the worst of this game is the greed. :/ I know fashion has nothing to do with the game but everything costs diamond barely anything costs gold so once you play it just gets old cuz your not gaining anything from it and you cant get diamond unless you pay real money. So already you've rendered gold useless. Rather than making all the clothes and stuff cost diamonds make most stuff cost a lot of gold so people can be motivated to keep playing and all the rare and unique clothes and stuff can cost diamonds which you can get by competing in events and stuff or completing challenges/quests. Do that and I give 5 star.

The intro made me convinced that it was a pro game made in a pro studio but it’s like a 1 or 2 people put this together and I can’t believe how much detail there is in this game the only problem I had was just getting stuck when climbing the ladder into the interrogation room. If I can get past that and really see more story then we have a VERY solid game here. I’d love to see future updates as well as a different icon for the game in the home screen. Maybe like, the triangle key. That would make people really curious. Anyway, great job and I can’t wait to see what else is done with this game.

Explore the cities and countryside of a vividly realized fictional version of the southwestern United States. You can tackle story-driven quests, gorge on fast food, outrun the police, or obey every traffic light—it’s up to you. This enormous game deftly displays Rockstar’s unique mastery of open-world design, and it never fails to entertain. Its a fantastic game, just like always. The controls are simple, but the storyline is complex, and great gameplay. Obviously, the graphics are top notch, but it makes up for it with storyline and gameplay. I love reading idiots who give it 1 star. No sound? probably because your device is horrendous. Bad controls? Check the settings. It honestly sounds like these people havent played a game in there life.Honestly, I cant complement this game enough. There are some missions that are hard, im looking at you, Wrong side of the tracks, but honestly, they are still fun. The side missions and things that you can do in San Andreas is epic. From getting haircuts, shopping for clothes, even being a paramedic! You can eat food and get fat, or work out and become strong. Or do both and become... Something. This game is one of the best, especially for mobile. I love this game, very fun, but there are a few glitches. The first one is on the robbery mission, sometimes when you get close to something CJ gets stuck on something and you can’t move which wakes up the person inside and then you get a 3 star wanted level. Another one is that the wrecking ball does not exist it is just a floating metal ball. Whenever I try to put a car in a garage it says you cannot store anymore vehicles in this garage even though my garage is completely empty and if I try to push my car in it will delete it. Another glitch I have experienced is that when I die during a gang war it gives the territory to me or it just removes it which I’m pretty sure is not supposed to happen. The last glitch happens on a date sometimes when you finish doing what she tells you to do instead of telling you to take her home, it doesn’t do that and when you do take her home you can’t drop her off, so you end up stuck with her and I have to restart the game. Also please put an option to disable tilt controls because I have to try to keep my iPad perfectly flat because if I don’t the car will pull to the other direction and it’s annoying.

I downloaded the chapter 5 story and played through until the part where I’m trying to save Waller from joker in his little, “Fun-House” and he sent his men after me as a distraction and it gave me two options that I could preform to take him down, neither of them would work, and then the guy would just shoot me down. I reset the game, powered off my phone completely, uninstalled the episode and played through it again, and it STILL won’t work. And now I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong, and could use some advice or maybe there’s a problem with the system?!I hope you guys can keep up the good work with Batman telltale, and please let me know what I should do or if there’s some kind of problem going on, thanks It’s the best Batman mobile experience your gonna get the whole story line is really great I even bought the season pack it was so good but I ran into a problem. I played episode 1-4 and it came to a point it said to purchase episode 5 and I swear I’m not lying I went to the store and it said the season pack was purchased. It made me really mad I reset the app moved it somewhere and it still made me purchase the season pack. So I wasted money trying to get episode 2-5 but I didn’t get same stitch. Made me really furious so I go check with my dad to make sure he bought me the season pack and he did it was a waist of $15. But it is a good game and all but come on man I wish I had episode 5 same stitch :( If you are making multi-platform games, then you should be targeting the screen sizes known to be used on those platforms. Sure Telltale’s first games were ports never intended for 4:3 screens, but at this point there is no excuse.Just to reiterate after the developer response. This game was created to only fit 16:9 screens despite Telltale knowing full well that it would be released on a plethora of platforms including mobile. Mobile phone manufacturers are not only pushing out a bunch of high end 18:9 screens but also have plenty of devices that use 4:3 screens. Not targeting these highly popular screen sizes shows a lack of polish to the game, and a lazy dev team that use an outdated and unwieldy engine. Why in the world should anyone pay the high price asked for this games when it doesn’t fit properly on their screen? Please stop releasing lazy ports and start developing properly for the whole range of devices you plan to sell your wares on.

But I actually really enjoyed this game! Both Survivalcraft games were really neat. But why does the full version cost $3.99? I understand this was a demo to lead players into the game, but what if someone really enjoyed the demo, and wanted to see more? Well, they couldn’t, cause the full game is $3.99! Still though, it’s probably worth your money.Also, there are some aspects I think you could add into the game:- So far, the only supernatural monster is a werewolf. And while that’s pretty cool, I think the game could some more monsters, like skeletons or vampires, or something along that line.- Why are those sailors leaving you on the island for good? I didn’t quite understand that part. Honestly, I think it would be cool if there were more of a story behind that. (Like, maybe you committed a crime and then the sailors had to exile you on a far-off island)- Maybe you could add villages dotted around the island, so that there are others that you can trade with and interact with.These are a few of my ideas; but overall the game is fun. Keep it up Candy Rufus! Ok, so please read this whole thing before you download. This is only a demo version. The real Survivalcraft is loads better. However, the full version is $3.99.   Yes, this only lets you play for one day, but look at the title people. This is so people can get a taste of the game before paying $4 for it. Candy Rufus Games is doing you a favor. Giving you a free sample, just a taste, to see if you like it before spending money. And people complain that it's only one day. Yeah, the demo is not as fun. I agree. But the fun version costs money! I'm sick and tired of people calling Survivalcraft a ripoff of Minecraft. Survivalcraft has much much more stuff, and is more realistic, you can freeze to death or get sick or run out of energy. Minecraft is for building. Survivalcraft is for SURVIVING. The full version of this game is so much fun! hey since I played survival craft back in the old days, I really hated it because I hate minecraft rip-offs. but when I started playing this for free in ios, [I used tutuapp to download but it has limited days so ya] I also watched your vids. but then I realized, man, this is the greatest game! but one day, I had to verify the app alot. so when I verified it, it eon't really verify. so please, if you're reading this, I just hope you made a free and full version of survival craft 2. everytime it won't verify, I had to delete and install, and delete, and install and.. forever and ever till' 2019. so if you see this, please please make survival craft 3 free!!! because alot of people wanted to see alot! only some of us raged because we waste money sometimes.. just please do it!

It would easily be a 5-star game if it didn’t have the technical problems; it really is wonderful in almost every way. Now to the only downside: because the game is a bit old, the controls can be very challenging. Here are a few tips for how to have the highest success rate possible for the controls:- When dragging an item from inventory, wait for the name of the object you’re dragging towards to appear before releasing- If the character doesn’t comment on your attempt in some way then the drag did not work — try again- Sometimes you just get a “bad drag.” It’s usually easier to try again than to keep dragging the object around for too long looking for the item name’s pop-up- Finally: don’t be too ashamed to use the tips. Some scenes seem a bit buggier and harder to explore than others. I still had fun while occasionally using tips to help me along so I didn’t keep trying to drag something that wasn’t going to work anyhow. Somehow this was particularly true for me in the very last scene of the game. Yeah, the controls are buggy, but you get used to them. If anything, I found the first chapter the most difficult and it got much easier from there. I finished the game despite the tough controls and it was very much worth it. :) Excellent game definitely one of my favorites I’ve played on IOS. There is an issue they’re aware of within saving the game, they are aware of the issue and I hope trying to fix it. The is a function under tools called wishingwell2.0 you I put a command which is: startchapter#   and will start you at the beginning of the chapter. I had the above problem and emailed there support team, it took them about a day and a half to get back to me according to my email it came in pretty late/early in the morning because I believe they’re from Germany, at least I know this game was like #1 Germany, game is completely in English though. I really look forward to completing this game it’s super awesome and really addictive. The players aren’t 2 dimensional except for the visual part, and at least I really grew to care about them as characters in an awesome game! I can’t wait to play again and go on to buy the next game The Inner Worlds 2. The Inner World is an incredibly creative and original game. The gameplay is (mostly) intuitive, and the puzzles are just the right amount of challenging. But the writing is where it really shines. The storyline is engaging; the writing is witty, funny, tender, and never dull. There’s a ton of dialogue, making the NPCs endlessly entertaining. Every character is fleshed out, and you’ll find the most interesting people in the most unexpected places.I would easily have given this 5 stars, except for one major issue: the hint system doesn’t work at all. I can see how it’s supposed to work, but it just... doesn’t. You click on things and nothing happens. Another more minor issue was that looking at/using items in your inventory is pretty difficult. I played this on an iPhone, for reference.Overall I enjoyed this game a lot, so much so that I bought the sequel, which is even better! I highly recommend both games. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

I've read every single choice of games book on the App Store, (except for that one about being an iron atom. I mean, what?) and this is most definitely the best one I've had the pleasure of ""playing"" coming in atop my former favorites, tin star and the heroes rise trilogy. This book delivered. I felt for the characters. I wanted to be there to comfort hatch, or lay a friendly hand on the ronin's shoulder when he was feeling overwhelmed. I enjoyed the dichotomy between the first book, which focused more on violence and swordplay, and this one, more attuned to the intellectual pursuits available in hyuga. Also, the last supper, Mona Lisa, and roof of the cistine chapel inclusions were much appreciated. I truly cannot wait until the third installment. I liked the emphasis on the character interactions, the depth one can see play out without needing the action to carry the plot along. I can respect that. The feel for established characters was there, the conflict and tension rising from the start and middle were great... Then it just took a turn for the strange that outright derailed it. One minute it is clear cut, next minute it's referencing something akin to inception in absurd ways that I felt hurt the story. I didn't enjoy the second half of the story due to how it went from character building, to questioning the characters roles in the story altogether, to a completely different story entirely that only referenced what was the original story. I loved the first Samurai of Hyuuga book, and I've replayed it many times. This book just felt like it was dragging its feet halfway through, tripped, and crawled towards the end with parallels to fantasy island as its crutch. Maybe I grew too fond to the flow of the previous books plot, but this felt hollow by the finish. I’ve never cared to write a review before but... the tone and writing is as good as the first. However it feels as if we are restricted to the choices we’ve made based on our stats. Now each choice isn’t clear in which your atunement is raised or lowered. It kind of bugged me as I wanted to diversify my character from book one, it was a bit frustrating having want to open up to my motley crew but feeling as if i wasnt supposed to. As character development is something every story should have.Now i dont really agree with other criticisms when we move onto the island. I feel like it’s a welcome addition, there are supposed to be supernatural elements that tug and mislead your path as the oni of greed tried to do in the first. I think if you really liked the first book definitely consider reading this one. I was only annoyed with the atunement stats, and that I had to take to google for a particular segment (one involving a japanese board game). This book is all about the aftermath after a storm with an exciting beginning and another storm brewing towards the end. Im hoping book 3 holds up considering the positive reviews. Definite props to the author. ","Samurai of Hyuga Book 2, Hosted Games LLC, Games, Adventure, Books, Role Playing, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

At first I was skeptical about downloading the app because there are so many interactive stories out there now and I’ve downloaded almost all of them, so I can honestly say that this app has by far been my utmost favorite! Other apps make you wait a certain amount of time until you have more “tickets” to read, so when I saw they have a star tree that lets you gather more quickly and that they give you access to one story per day, to read for up to 4 days for free, I almost had a heart attack! I hate waiting in anticipation to gather up enough tickets (or in this apps case, Stars) in order to continue the story line, so this app has been like a dream for me! As long as I get access to one story a day and then use my stars for another I’m all set! Of course everyone loves animations, but I am content with the little breathing animations they give the characters that make them breath off the page. Anything more than that and I feel like I’d rather just watch an anime at that point. Anyway, sorry for the long review but I just couldn’t hold back how happy I was about the quality of this app and I needed to share! Wish the app makers would consider their readers value more seriously!!! The choices that cost gems for one are extremely high costing and not to mention within one single chapter the amount of times they want you to make that costly choice is ridiculous then on top of it clothing and hair that’s very high priced ...30 gems??? That’s straight ridiculous. The free choice of clothing is always something stupid like baggy sweats or overalls or baggy dirty clothing but yet in the story they will claim it’s a dress it’s stupid if the story says a dress then make the clothing fit the description and that stuff should be free seeing how it’s wrote about! The visual should match the description or else what’s the dang point?? We want attractive characters and to see what the story is saying so it makes sense!! Not to mention we barely get any videos an with it one single gem when everything is always like 17-30 gems!!! To even purchase gems you would need more than $100 to be able to choose the choices you want per chapter! Now that’s ridiculous and highway robbery these people only seem to care about taking money from people I swear then they don’t have many decent ways for you to earn things they also need to speed up the stars tree cause that’s also ridiculous! If you want a better app check out chapters they give way more free gems and multiple per video and have many other ways to earn gems and have better free stuff The other day I wrote a great long review on this app/game. I gave the reasons I loved the app and then rated it on different scales ect so I won’t go into detail on that again. However, I wasn’t sure where I could write this small complaint so here I am again. There is a slot machine game within the app and when you play the slots you pay 10 diamonds each time in hopes of winning large amounts of diamonds or various others wins. As for me I played this many times and have spent tons and tons of diamonds trying to win characters, diamonds ect. Anyway 3 times now I’ve played the slots and won 100 diamonds each. I was unber excited however my winnings never showed or came to me in my diamond bank. This is very disappointing due to the fact I love the game and I love the slot machine concept. Though I’m sure you can imagine how frustrating this is to spend real money on diamonds, play the game win and not get your winnings. That’s 300 diamonds Worth that I’ve lost out on. Among the many dollars I’ve spent on this game buying diamonds to play with. Not to mention the hours of playing and getting daily wins ect.This will not stop me from playing the game however it will stop me from playing the slots game and spending unnecessary money on the app. 🤷‍♀️ ","Moments: Choose Your Story, Koramgame.com, Games, Role Playing, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I will give it a very much deserved 5 stars!I have been playing this game for several weeks now and so far it is awesome!The game has an option built in that if you die, you start from the previous day but the negative effects are gone and if you die 3 times, you can request one of 3 help crates, Food, resources or weapons. This game is by far one of the better games you can find in the App Store. I would like to encourage the developers to make more games like this one. I really like this game compared to others I played because your not thrusted into difficulty so quick. Areas that are easier allow you to build resources but its up to you who you use them to help further you in the game to more difficult challenges. The only drawbacks in the games is the controls which seem cumbersome, theres some in-game bugs. And the English text dialogue could use some work. We are glad you like our game. Our team is a small indie dev team.We know the English localization is far from perfect in the current version, if you are a native speaker and really wish to help us to do the proofread, you can email us after you play through it once.

This happens a lot. The word does not match what the player is looking for. Ive lived all over the world and im pretty sure casket never means toolbox. But the i spy aspect is tricky enough to be difficult and keep you playing. So if a non english speaker made the word list- maybe get someone to help you redo it. Its beyond annoying. I have to use up my hints just to figure out what the heck a word refers to!! A tap? A shoe? What? What is a tap? Oh. A spigot. Aha. Tap. Or a tray? Looked like a medallion/shield/ anything but a tray. Just saying. Redo the wording and 5 stars. Everything else. Great. This is another fun HO game from Crisp. I’ll be sad when I’ve played all their HO games. At first, I thought this was going to be an easy game and was ready to pass but as you go through levels it becomes quite challenging. 5 stars are for this game and if I could rate the ad content it would be  1. I don’t mind ads yet what I do mind is redundant ads. While playing, the same ad played over and over. This gets very annoying. Additionally, you can’t X out the ad you have to watch the entire ad and it’s not the usual short ads that Crisp uses. This would make a more pleasurable game if the developers switched up the ad content. Don’t bypass playing based on my ad dislike as this is a great HO game. I really like this game a lot. However it seems really really are stupid (i’m sorry I just couldn’t think of a diplomatic word to replace stupid). In between every game there is an advertisement for Homescapes. I’ve probably seen that 30 second video Hundreds of times. Never, ever a new video, always the same thing. Now guys if I haven’t downloaded that game yet, chances are about 0% that I’m going to. I do download new games from these advertisements from time to time. That is how I ended it with your game. But this particular redundant of replaying it over and over and over is just annoying. Don’t you have anything else that would be of interest to people? At any rate, I hope to see a change. Really sorry to hear that :( If fact it's '3rd party' advertising and we have a very little control over what they show. Our game is really free - you could play all the scenes without any additional purchases and the advertising is our monetization. Though we are going to make our best to exclude such repeating ads.  As an option for $0.99 you could remove all and any ads forever. Thank you for the feedback!

It got worse the longer you played the game. I’m currently on an iPad Air 2 running the latest iOS as of writing this review. There’s also a few texture bugs where sometimes things would turn into weird gray squares, but they're nothing game breaking. Gun controls could be better as well, but they’re enjoyable for the most part. The game gets a bit repetitive the more you play it too. But besides all that, it’s a solid and fun game. Interesting story and characters, nice soundtrack (although there’s only 4-5 songs per station), decent graphics for a mobile game, fun gameplay, and plenty of things to do besides missions. Be warned, though. The game has definitely showed it’s age. Overall a solid purchase and I’m happy. I just finished the main story and got everything I wanted to do done. Go ahead and buy it! I think it’s worth it. So I have been playing the game for 3 hours on and off and I noticed a couple of things you can't do. You can't do drive-by shooting and you can't aim wherever you want when shooting people. It was kind of a let down even though those are minor flaws. I'd love to see a update in the future where these two things might be addressed. Other than that, the game is amazing. Oh and it'd be neat if there was a way to enter codes to access all weapons, armor and to be able to drive the tank. Update: if you could make this game full screen and fix the bugs that are making it freeze up that would be great. I noticed GTA Vice City got an update and it looks way better in full screen for iPhone XS Max There once was an awesome review I spent probably 30 mins typing. Then I hit cancel instead of send. *palm to the forehead* ...almost drops phone and swipes on screen nearly deleting this.. #epicfail         This game is a classic piece of moving art. If you don't like it, Don't play it. If you only game on your phone and this is your first time, don't download; You're not worthy. Pros: Enhanced graphics. from original PS2 and PC versions. (Lighting slightly off on mobile version)     Smooth frame rate.            I originally played this on my iPod 4th gen with Retina display 32 gb and was greatly impressed by how smooth the game ran. (Of course, once support of devices with iOS 6.0 stopped, the game became choppier) it runs like a charm on my iPhone SE as of now.     Thrilling Storyline. I'm sure you've played this before, if you haven't. Don't download it, remember??? You're not worthy!! (Haha)    Easy Controls.Sure it may be slightly complex at times. (""Look at me contradicting the title of this next segment!"" 😅) What do you expect? Your fingers are covering up most of the screen...be thankful we live in a time that you can play, what was once a home console video game, on your cell phone!!

The leveling is hard enough to get you an amazing feel of challenge but at the same time not give you a sense of frustration. This game is what most other games fail to accomplish: a perfect balance. The hidden weapons and trinkets are hard enough to take you some time to find them but not placed in an impossible place. I only ever had to look up at ONE hidden trinket. I chose a balanced set for my skills. Meaning that I wasn’t putting ALL or most of my skill points on attack or health. Even with that I still was progressing normally and with a healthy amount of difficulty. All of the bosses had fair attacks and phases to the point that if you died it was more of bad planning on your part than bad/faulty programming. The best part of this game though, is that it never forces you to continue on the main storyline. You always have the option to spend hours leveling up or looking for hidden stuff as you try to 100% the game. All of that makes for one hell of a game for traveling or waiting for a class to start, as you will be spending hours piecing together the lore, or just leveling up until you are one-hit killing bosses. Definitely a must have game on any phone! I hate writing reviews but I’m so impressed with this release that I feel it’s my duty as an avid gamer to do so.....sooooo here it goes-if the castlevania/Metroid genre ( admittedly more the first than the latter) had a baby with a fine tuned rpg,then ud have this game.  Everything-literally,graphics,gameplay,story,overall execution,etc are done near flawlessly, 5 star all the way, if u,like myself have wished for a castlevania release on IOS,well then like myself ur gonna have to keep on waiting......BUT if ur down with the next best and in some respects better thing then GET THIS GAME....u will not regret itPost edit:had the game for a few days now and all I can say over and over and over is WOW just simply WOW....I from the bottoms of my heart wish u guys win some kind of game of the year award....it would take me multiples of multiples of paragraphs to do this game justice......This game is 100% worth double the asking price.....and this last bit is real talk-just to the devs: PLEASE keep making games,please,Grimvalor is an example of everything IOS gaming can and should b,u kno what I’m talking about and from one fan of tru gaming to a a group of who I can only assume is made up of the same-congrats-this game will go down as one of the best on this platform First let me start by saying that the 2D and 2.5D Castlevania games are my favorite games and have been for over 25 years!  With that being said, this is not a Castlevania game, but it in the same style of a Castlevania game, closest I’ve seen yet on IOS.  The graphics are great, the sound experience and music fits the game really well, and the controls, once you get used to them, actually work rather well.  It took me a little to master (or try to master) the controls, especially some of the special moves, but lots of practice and I actually like the control system.  Of course, I’d rather play with a controller and always will prefer a controller.  The gameplay is fun, challenging yet not too difficult as in the early Castlevania games, the save points are strategically placed, and I really enjoyed the story!  One of the best action platformers with RPG elements that I’ve played on IOS and I’ve been playing IOS games for over 8 years now.  I look forward to this company’s next game, and would ask for some possible DLC such as new levels/areas and perhaps stronger weapons.  Excellent game for the money, highly recommend!

I’ve played many point and click adventure games and I must say this is in my top 5! The graphics are great, the storyline is interesting and easy to follow. I liked that most steps to be taken were logical and I only got really stuck a couple times, however, there is a help guide in the game that will give you just enough to get past the section you may be stuck without ruining anything else. I’ve already downloaded the 2nd installment and can’t wait to start playing! I had been enjoying this game very much (love the mystery plot line and the graphics), although not as much as as the Syberia series, which is why I bought this game—because it was somewhat similar to it—but I got stuck early on, because an obvious glitch.  At some point, you need water to combine with plaster in a bowl if you want to advance in the game, but the item is nowhere to be found in any of the screens. I can’t proceed and I don’t want to go back to the beginning of the game to start over again in the hope that the glitch has been solved with the newest update. It’s very frustrating. I hope the developer solves this problem. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this game. I absolutely love everything about this game. From the storyline, to the graphics and all the different scenes...by the way, there’s a lot of them....all the puzzles and things you need to do to move on, combine and build and even the voices. Truly, this game rocks, I was never bored and have played again and again. It’s pretty long, which I absolutely love and takes quite awhile to finish n most definitely a brain teaser...worth every penny plus more! Highly recommend.

I had been playing ridiculously complicated escape games by Tan You, so this by comparison seemed too easy. It’s actually quite enjoyable, and I love the spookiness factor. And it definitely took more than an hour, but still shorter than I’d like.I wish there was a little less hand-holding, the notes throughout the game gave you answers to every puzzle/lock. Well done game, good creepy atmosphere, but as mentioned, too short. About an hour play time🙁 I have been dreaming about a pack like this. Just for $15 you get endless entertainment. I am a fan of adventure games and tried all of them out there and I can say that these 5 games in the bundle are just awesome I bought this game even when it did not come with hints. I painstakingly played it all the way towards the end without complaining or going online for walkthrough, only to be stuck in the final puzzle (in the chapel) that seems impossible to complete; it was like the rubics cube concept. I bought this game to while away my time and to have fun in the process, not to wipe away my patience and be aggravated in the end. I do not recommend this game to anyone.

‎Dark Fear,"*** WARNING: This game contains frightening scenes which some players may find disturbing! *** *** MEDIA REVIEWS: Toucharcade - 90% / Gamezebo - 90% / Appgamer - 100% *** NOTE: If the game ""hangs"" at the blacksmith it's usually due to low-resource issues on your device. Try shutting down all background apps and freeing up some space before restarting your device. This should help fix the issue.  For the best experience we recommend you play Dark Fear on an iPad with a decent pair of headphones. DESCRIPTION You wake up in pitch blackness. You have no idea who you are, where you are or how you got here - it's up to you to figure it out!  For horror game fans seeking out that ultimate fix, 'Dark Fear' delivers an immersive, frightening experience wrapped in a cinematic soundtrack and a dark, twisted storyline written by an ex-film industry professional. The game can only described as blend between RPG and adventure with a 2D graphical style similar to the classic PC games from the 1980s (think Myst meets Kings Quest). Its simplistic approach allows even the most casual gamers to gently unfold and enjoy its many complex layers of game mechanics. Explore a diverse landscape filled with forests, mountains, lakes and deserts. Make allies in the local village, upgrade your weapon and armor, go hunting/fishing and fight your way to the truth by slaying your foes, solving puzzles and helping people with their problems.

I rarely give 5 star reviews, this one definitely deserves it. I think maybe people are put off by the old-style pixelated graphics, but that is a big mistake. Especially if you are looking for a good adventure game that is also quite scary! I was surprised that a pixelated-style graphics game could be scary at all, but it certainly delivers. If the graphics were more realistic, it would've probably been too scary for me. It was just right. And I can't think of a thing to criticize about it, just like another great game, The Room. This game was fun, definitely worth the price, and I hope it gets more attention so this developer will hopefully make more super-enjoyable games. :) This game is incredible. I read the reviews and wondered why they were praising this relatively unknown game so much. Figured it was worth a try and I was not disappointed! The soundtrack is gorgeous, there are legitimate jump scares and creepy characters/landscapes. The puzzles are relatively easy but the storyline keeps you interested and engaged. I can not recommend this game more highly if you love adventure games. Where has this game been hiding, and WHY isn't it among Apple's best of the best?!? Despite the retro graphics, the game has exceptional gameplay, story, and soundtrack, and is even creepier than a lot of higher end games out there. Well worth the money you'd otherwise spend on a cheeseburger, and way more satisfying!Would love to see a sequel.

I liked this game so much, i still remember how it visually looked, and it was so gorgeous! It was so amazing, so pretty! This game is no closer to it. For example the very start of it. Like what the heck, this is a forest theme, why you gotta put an anime girl beside? I am saying that the visuals of this game got SO SO SO SO much worse. But, while you play, it looks exactly like the one that was in the past, and reminds me of the good memories i had from this game in the past.I am just a little dissapointed that the visuals of the game changed so much, that was pretty much the reason me and my mum downloaded it. Very similar to Zumba’s Revenge which I was excited for, but this is disappointing.There is no way to change the color of the ball you’re about to shoot to the next color. The aiming “bonus” is useless since it just shoots the ball wherever you tap the screen. Also, the unnecessary anime girl standing by the sign after every level has absolutely nothing to do with the game. An ad after every single level with no option to remove them is also undesirable. There’s no way to save your progress, though it’s unnecessary because you’re basically playing the same 5 or so levels over and over and over. Overall it could be good with more development but for now - not even a little impressed.

I spent a good 10 minutes trying to exit the kickstand bar at the beginning of the game, old mine road (more specifically, the highway) just simply will go black sometimes or not have a character sprite. The cutscenes are very easy to accidentally skip, you might have to restart the game to be able to exit an area and sometimes that doesn’t even work, currently, I am incapable of moving forward from the minefield because the exit button does not work.It’s still the game it was in 1995 and with the remastered version, the art is well updated, but I don’t recommend playing it on iOS, get it on your PC or Ps4, it’s not worth the frustration here.To sum up, don’t buy it on your phone/tablet until the developers have fixed it.It’s a shame I have to leave 3 stars on a good game. I'm writing this review from someone who grew up in this era but never played FT before. And was extremely apprehensive to purchase due to the negative Old Mine Rd bug. Didn't want to buy and get stuck but figured during the app sale to take a flyer. Glad I did...I'm using a mini iPad 4. Since I never played before I finally got to the Mine Rd spot. I spent many do overs and probably played that area for an hour and not once did I experience any problems. Nor did I have any issues controlling the bike at all. I never crashed it during that hr. I just didn't know how to beat the different bikers with what type of weapon. The controls at the destruction derby are whacked... that is until you figure it out. It took a long time but instead of trying to control the left and right side of the screen, just touch your car, keep your finger on the screen and drag your car as if you're tracing a path!  Spoiler alert- then you can jump on the orange car easily and push it onto and off the second ramp.  You don't even need to be precise for the cutscenes to happen. I've been using a walk through up to that point to see if I could do it but alas sorta had to cheat. Been a good experience so far. I'm about 85% done. I think Grim Fandgo is the best, followed by Day of Tentacle then Full Throttle. But that's my opinion. Don't let the bug comments stop you at least for a mini iPad 4. I loved Full Throttle when I first played it in 1995 and still consider it to be my favorite adventure game. Many of the best LucasArts games from that era have been remade for iOS and I've been pleased by all of them, especially Monkey Island 2 and Grim Fandango. But this might be the best! The new, redrawn artwork is HD but somehow looks exactly like the original low resolution graphics in that nothing was materially changed, just smoothed and filled out. The audio is far better now (I never realized how low fidelity it was!) and the bonus features are super fun for ""old"" fans like me. Only complaint is that it's too easy to accidentally skip cutscenes. Maybe this should have an ""Are you sure?"" nag prompt before proceeding with the skip.*** Update ***I happily got through the game to the point where I enter the Old Mine Road on an iPhone 8 and it crashes every time I’m approaching Father Torque. I can’t continue the game. It reminds me of the game crashes I had on my 486 computer in 1995 at this very same part of the game, which I was able to solve with a driver update or something. That sort of tweaking isn’t possible in iOS though, so I can only wait for Double Fine to address the problem. Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

Just a few things I’d love to see: 1. Can you please move the boosters from the lower part of the screen? As a right-handed person, I keep pushing them on accident as I’m trying to move my character around the screen. My husband (a lefty) had the same problem when they were on the left part of the screen. Very, very frustrating! Move them some where in the upper half of the screen, please! (I’m begging you!🙏🏻) 2. Maybe there could be a special level available once in a while to help gamers collect the iron and red gems needed to upgrade the stronghold?3. I love trying to achieve the various characters! If you’re ever looking for new characters ideas, might I suggest you turn to mythology and the plethora of gods there. You could use some thing from each of their personalities as their special gift (e.g. lighting for Zeus, a war hammer for Thor, sunburst for Apollo, etc.) A new update came out today in the game removing the keys to open the chests, y’all gave us credit for the keys that we had and not the chests. I had over 40 normal chests and at least 2 Epic chests that I’ve been trying to open, since removing the keys I just lost out on A LOT of iron, character tokens, and lots of other things. I am very upset that you guys cheated us out of the credit of those chests. It took lots of hours of game play to achieve those chests and just like that you removed them from my inventory. If I don’t get credit for those chests, I will delete this game. I have shared this game with a number of friends including my Fiancé and they are all upset with this update as well. If this matter is not fixed or dealt with, we will all stop playing this game. It frustrates me because this was my favorite game but every time you do a new update I get cheated in a different way all the time. SoMerging needs to be done about this. Now anytime I try to watch an ad to open the video boxes the game freezes and the only way to fix it you have to leave the game, resulting in the loss of a life, many of the ads do this at the beginning at the game resulting in the loss of an additional life lost. This game seems to have more cheats and problems then the game is even worth playing. This game is no longer worth my time or effort if it’s always going to result in unhappy players! I spent a metric BUTTLOAD of time playing this game back when it was in Ye Olden Days—you only had 3 lives, you regained one every 30 minutes, and your only objective was to find gems. You didn’t have to go to a goblin to cash in on your gems; if you died, they were still yours. Everything was perfect like that—I enjoyed the simplicity, so I worked my way up to level 176. I completed the tasks for rebuilding the village to the max and just kept the extra stars I had in hopes that one day there’d be more tasks to spend them on. My pickaxe had nearly THREE HUNDRED hits. I even unlocked ALL of the little characters. I was having a blast—and then I took a break to spend time with my family after my brother went off to college and we had a series of hiccups in the family. Things died down and so, I finally came back...only to find all of my self-described accomplishments blown to BITS. Stars lost! Pickaxe at 30 hits! No characters! I have to talk to a goblin every two minutes or I lose everything! And all I got in compensation was a bunch of gold coins that I don’t even know the purpose of. I understand the revamp and I’m happy YOU like it,  but I’m just here to tell you that at LEAST one person absolutely hates it. I played this app for so long and all I got out of it was the developers spitting in my mouth. My disappointment is immeasurable.

I redownloaded it recently not realizing it was the same game and this time around I really enjoy it. I’m not very far into it yet but the only thing I’m not really fond of is the way of gaining stars. I don’t mind the way of playing the folder multiple times gives you a star each time and it’s not dependent on how many moves remain. But what I don’t enjoy too much is the actual like connect the dots game on how you gain stars. I don’t know if maybe there are different ones the further into the game you get but I fear if it’s just the little color matching game the entire way through I’ll get bored quickly. And I enjoy the storyline too much to just give up. But I really hope there’s more types of mini games to gain stars later on. Do you enjoy watching thrillers or crime investigations? Do you enjoy reading about investigations? What about that feeling of suspense that puts you on the edge of your seat?Then this game just might be for you! I can’t express it enough how much I enjoy this game! It’s so realistic, and captures the reader’s attention as if you are actually having these conversations. I feel like I am actually a part of the storyline, at times I forget that these aren’t real people or real conversations. I wish there was an option to change your gender and name. I feel like if I could change it to my gender and my name, it would feel more realistic. Aside from that, I really enjoy this game and I just started playing today. I get so into these conversations and once I run out of stars, I want to continue getting more stars so I can continue playing. I still cannot believe how realistic it is. From the texting, the photos, videos, documents you send, and the phone calls! It’s currently my favorite mobile phone game! I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in games where you can make choices, and see how the story ends up. I have three children and hardly ever get some time to myself. Playing this game is a nice way for me to relax and decompress at the end of the day. I waited a long time to write a review and I usually don’t review games. This game has an amazing concept. Love the story line- I don’t even mind the mini games yet- however they are very hard. I have been stuck on level 23 for a while and still need another star to progress. A few suggestions - have daily deals on coins half off or small packs like unlimited lives for 2 hours plus 50 gold and a few boosts for 5 bucks etc. it would make all the difference. I also obviously haven’t beaten the game yet but i did see from someone else that after you complete this story, there is no more. I am very sad about that. If developers chose to add another story- please restart the levels as they get so hard it would be impossible to continue. I also wouldn’t mind the mini games being a bit more game related. Like maybe connect the colored squares to find clues in a crime scene picture, or just show us a picture and have us solve the crime based off of it etc. I really love the concept of this game but really would like a little more.

Is it a commentary on the fragile nature of trust and human connection? A scathing critique of our blind adherence to authority? Or is it just really weird? Regardless, INSIDE is an incredible journey with increasingly bizarre encounters that mix action with clever puzzle designs. The game isn’t meant to be entirely understood. It’s meant to be experienced.  I started playing this game a while back, and it’s been a very interesting experience. This is about as indie as a game can get, which means dark themes, creepy stories, mostly grey backgrounds with red accents and ominous music. Overall, I would say that this is a fun, challenging puzzle game with great atmosphere, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes indie games.But there’s a catch. The controls are absolutely infuriating at times, completely ruining the experience. I went on a half-year long hiatus from this game, because the controls were so terrible, and they were preventing me from solving a seemingly simple puzzle. When your character is just walking around, they’re fine, but when he needs to run, that’s when the flaws really start to show. It is sometimes physically impossible to make him run fast enough without taking your finger off the screen and stopping entirely, which usually results in him getting caught, and don’t even get me started on the water levels. This is a fantastic game, but don’t buy it on the App Store. Get it on Steam, or wherever else they sell it where you don’t need to use a touch screen to move. Yes, it is a lot more expensive on those platforms, but the reason all of these computer/console games are so cheap on mobile is because it makes for an overall worse experience with these ultimately inferior control systems. So yes, you should get this game. Just don’t do it here. I’m in my forties and have been gaming since gaming began. I’m not a fan of platformers for the most part but this game is like nothing I’ve ever played before.Visually, it’s a spectacle to behold. Amazing environments and animations. The attention to detail is among the highest I’ve ever seen. The deaths are truly disturbing and gut wrenching (like the sound of your body hitting the ground after a long fall). You’ll want to avoid death just because of the brutality of it. Yet, every way your character dies, you’ll want to experience at least once since it’s so well done. The story is dark and crazy (almost like a Black Mirror episode) and the audio is perfect. Also, the controls, contrary to what some reviews say, are spot on and buttery smooth. This game is never leaving my phone since it’s with experiencing over and over. Kudos to the devs for such an amazing work of art.P.s. I’ve noticed nearly all poor reviews are from idiots who have phones that aren’t compatible. Children, you can’t rate a game one star because your hardware can’t handle it! Use your brains! Other morons criticize the pay model, which is perfect! You download it for free and get to play the first chapter. If you like it, you can purchase the full premium game (which is a steal, by the way). If you don’t, you didn’t have to spend a penny to figure it out. I wish all games were like this.

I had to play on the developers time when they wanted me to; now I can play on my time when I feel like it.The game has a lot of the little issues from the original like the feeling that the true enemy of the game is its auto targeting system that I often wish there was a way to let me quickly override in game. Otherwise its got the same great twin stick action and short missions with challenging objectives.This version does have some features removed present in the IAP version such as multiplayer which I remember was a really enjoyable game mode for me. I can't really fathom why that with be removed in this version but it really is a bummer not to have it.Theres a lot of potential in future updates to add things like co-op, multiplayer, a rogue like Risk of Rain style game mode or a boss rush mode. Even custom community made missions would be a great way to add endless content and value to players. I'm glad the developers went this route with the monetization and I really enjoyed how much I've played so far and I am looking forward to finishing and 3 staring every mission, ideally with a friend in co-op, but even the single player is a lot of fun. Gameplay is great. Now that it’s not free to play the money system seems to be broken though. You end up with so much extra gold with nothing to spend it on. Also every star challenge involves the same handful of guns for some reason. The game is enjoyable for the first few hours, but gets repetitive later on. I was excited when I began playing - tons of weapons, gear, and abilities to unlock - but as I progressed, the game’s shortcomings began to present themselves. You’ll unlock everything around level 40 and then you’ll be trapped in a cycle of monotony for the latter half of the game. Upgrades don’t feel rewarding, levels are copied and pasted with only minor tweaks, and the shooting mechanics are lackluster. Your gun aims itself, stripping the player of any sense of agency. Also the in game currency is handed out like candy, rendering it almost useless because you never have to decide what to spend it on. Want that upgrade? Buy it. Want this upgrade? But it. There’s no need to manage your resources sense they flow like water. Again, let me say, I enjoyed this game for a few hours, but by the end it felt quite empty, unrewarding, and tedious. Three stars for a solid two hours of content and no in app purchases, but nothing ground breaking here.

The story is also wholly worth it... it's a bit unconventional by most otome game standards, but rather unique and engaging. Honestly, I was a bit iffy on the art (sometimes the characters come off looking a bit derpy to me) at first but the storyline sealed the deal for me and after a while, the art didn't bother me as much as it did when I was playing the Lite version. However, this isn't your typical fluff so if you're looking for a lot of lovey-dovey type actions and such, you probably won't get much out of it.The length of this game is pretty average at seven chapters (plus the epilogues), given that the story continues with the other characters. I won't bother to go into the storyline, but I liked the approach to the story and the options you're given throughout. The options given were actually much more challenging for me than most other otome games so I really liked that aspect. If you choose the best answers you'll receive an epilogue after every chapter you achieve an ""S"" rank, which is vital if you're looking for the romance in all this! I am looking forward for the other character routes and to see how the plot progresses. :) Okay, I'll be honest; after I played through the game once, I set it down and forgot about it for three months.Today, I found it again in the very back of all my iPhone's pages of apps. I remembered how the game had appealed to me the first time, so I clicked it and started playing from the very beginning, the prologue.Oh boy. Sucked into the storyline immediately, I read and read until I was finished. I enjoyed the fairly hard choices to make each stage-- they were much harder than most otome game's choices. Akio was utterly adorable, and may I mention that his voice acting was perfect? His adult version was sexy and his child version was adorable. The voices were great.I will admit I was a bit taken back by the artwork sometimes. There were many occasions where the characters just looked plain weird. Still, the characters and plotline are well worth it. I found myself less bothered by the art by the fifth chapter than I could have imagined.Excellent story. Can't wait for the new ones. I was really disappointed with this visual novel. In my opinion, the story was somewhat flat and predictable, though it had its funny moments. For example, the carrot incident, which is immediately cut off by the game over. Speaking of which, the game gives you little to no freedom and forces you to take on the role of a character you know nothing about and guess what they're into. Sure, these choices are made fairly obvious by adhering to some humble hero standard, but doesn't that just make it less exciting?  And if you make the wrong choice, you are sent to the beginning of the stage (which makes sense since you are in a game, but is still annoying as crap). Also, the art was actually painful to look at. There were few instances where I saw any of the characters as attractive, and it was really only the princess.I had my doubts about this VN to begin with, but seeing all the praise it was receiving as well as  it being one of the few visual novels in the app store, I decided to buy it. After playing the VNs ""Scar of the Doll"" and ""Moe Cure Net"" for both a dollar each, I may have had high expectations from more expensive novels. ""Kira*Kira"" and ""Tears 9, 10"" were able to satisfy, but this just didn't seem well worth the price to me. Sorry.3/5 Would not recommend.(I tried to format this review for easy reading.)

Instead of having to flip through countless books trying to find something specific, like a spell or racial feat from something less common, most of that is here and accessible within a few seconds. PSA: if you buy this, download discord and hop into their channel. You can speak directly to the developers and they’re very responsive. ALSO PSA: this app, while fantastic and easily the best out there in my opinion that I’ve seen, is still in its youth. Be patient with the developers and let them update their content. All in all, I’m beyond happy with the Prism apps and look forward to using them to adventure away into the sunset for many years to come. Hi. I have downloaded this program onto two different devices. For the most part it works fine, but on my iPad you can’t scroll down on the ability cards. All the other cards work just fine though. On my iPhone, I was also having trouble with the ability cards. This time is wasn’t that I couldn’t scroll down, it was that when I try to search for specific items, just just blocks out the search bar all together. It makes it so I can’t search. Those where my only problems with the app besides it not having all the creatures, but then again, who will? Over all, it’s a great app and is definitely worth getting if you are a dm. Hey Nathon! Thanks for the review! I think we talked a bit over email about this issue. So we are currently reworking cards/compendium functionality in the player app which we will soon (hopefully this week) be moving over to the dm app. We are getting rid of the problematic search bar and adding better formatted spell cards for viewing in landscape/portrait. Thanks again! I’ve been on the look out for a decent DM tool to use during my games. I have found a few apps that are ok at a few things. But none of which have had a solid foundation for the future. The PrismScrollDM app has that solid foundation to build upon. The UI is clean and useful. The performance is outstanding, and further more the developer/developers are responsive and always willing to answer your questions. If I could wish for anything, it would be that PrismScrollDM would take some ideas of out the app Encounter+I feel like the Prism team could make a much better, more refined version of that app. They certainly have the fan base. Hello Joshua and thank you for the review! The faith that you have in our products to grow reinforces our own belief for what we want to see PrismScroll become. I had actually talked with the developer(s) of Encounter+ a bit about there tv functionality. I think their product is awesome and has some pretty great functionality. I definitely think you are right in that there are things we could learn and apply to the PrismScroll way of doing things. Stay tuned!

PRESS: ----- Allaboutsymbian.com review: ""A good adventure game which can be recommended to anyone interested in the genre. There's no simple-minded action here, the puzzles do demand that you think about them so you can solve them. But if you're into adventure games then that's exactly what you want to hear.""  ----- Softonic.com review: ""On the whole, it is a captivating game that perfectly recreates the old graphical adventure genre to help transport you back to the 80s."" ----- Handango.com ""CrazySoft team strikes back with this excellent game that offers an intriguing adventure, intelligent gameplay, clever puzzles and good lasting appeal. Highly recommended!"" USER INTERFACE:  The point and click interface is as easy as that: You point and click somewhere on the game and you have two options: 'Examine' (Click the eye) or 'Operate' (Click the hand). 'Examine' looks at the spot you clicked and 'Operate' tries to do something with this spot. Sometimes there are multiple choices that you can do or say. E.g.: 'Take the bottle' and 'Leave the bottle there'.In this case you will see this choice box before the text.Just click the choice you wish once to select it and once more to activate it. Its as simple as that!  The game is really open. You can go almost wherever you want. If you want to get out of a place and visit another one just click on this icon. It means that there is an exit. The character icon shows where you are standing on the place. You can climb ladders, sit on chairs etc. You can 'Use Items from the inventory' to that icon as if you want to 'Operate' something on you. E.g.: If you have a trousers in the inventory and you want to wear it. You must click the trousers and then this icon.",https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/f1/8a/83/f18a8366-aef2-79f6-737b-2822f040968c/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-2.png/1200x630wa.png,Text Adventure Game,5.0 • 2 Ratings,$3.99,,"October 10, 2018","The game is really, really good, for a .99$ game. There are simple, although sometimes pretty strange and out of place solutions, the dialogs made me chuckle and it took me three one hour bus trips to beat it - if you're bored, get it! Title says it all, after you spend (at most) 30min playing this game chances are you've beaten it which means it is impossible to replay since you know all of the answers. It's just like a point and click, except for this you've got to pay $1, though small in amount is it really worth half an hour? In my opinion j don't believe this game is worth it, I've played some pretty intense point and clicks and this game couldn't make my top 15.

We should be allowed to repeat a event i worked so hard for the first event horse and once I got it I was going for the next one but sense I didn’t have the time to do it I couldn’t get the horse that will be very helpful to be able to repeat events.For those of you that are wondering how to chat you HAVE to be 13+ when you join in the game then select your 13 or older to chat  it’s possibly better so we don’t have very young children chatting with people who are possibly WAYYYY over there age (like around 22 yr olds) and we shouldn’t have to deal with young kids chatting we don’t know what there thinking when there talking IF you signed up as below 13 yrs of age and are now 13 you may need to contact the developers to change it I love this game. It is easy to understand and it is for free. But what I don’t like about is all of the glitching. The game will start a race In the middle of a course and eat you coins as soon as you touch the next jump. Or it will bring you home and not have your bat filled like it did before. Please fix this, then I will give you a better rating. Thank you for your time to make this game, just fix a few things! Thank you! Second off, how do you talk to other horses? I read someone’s review and it says that they can talk to other horses in the game. I don’t understand why some of the quests are so hard at level 19. Own 5 horses when it says you only have 2 and I know I have 5 horses 6 actually sometimes this game is confusing and I don’t understand some of the things it tells you to do when you HAVE done it.  I would also like to know which level you can talk to other horses. I would like to know this because I HATE ITWHEN OTHER HORSES FOLLOW YOU AROUND- EVERYWHERE YOU GO!  🤬 🤬🤬 !!!! It is super annoying and I just want to tell them please stop following me around. Lynette only time I can get away from them is when they are beginners and they don’t have the jump arena paradise cove or the mystic cave. please just try your hardest to do all of these things for me. Thank you!

And I have a lot of games. For starters it’s really easy to get free mode. And I love free mode because you could do what ever you want on it. And the levels are also really fun to. Mostly because you have a specific objective and you get to look around this whole entire city and bump into things and knock things over and look for what you need. Overall Dino simulator is by far one of most fun games out there and you will be missing out if you don’t get it. The game is fun when you’re not being interrupted by a stupid ad right IN THE MIDDLE OF GAME PLAY! I can understand having ads AFTER a round. That would make sense, but WHILE you’re playing the game? That’s just stupid and annoying! Plus, there are too many! The interruptions mess you up and the game starts playing again before the ad close button pops up, so you lose valuable time and/or you continue to take damage from the enemy. The dinosaur is a little hard to maneuver but I can deal with that. It’s just an added challenge. However, it would be nice to be able to choose what side you want the controller on, especially if you’re right handed.Oh, and at one point, when you first start playing the game, it tries to extort a 5 star review out of you before it will let you play one of the modes. Come on... you want a five star review? Come by it honestly and fix the above issues. That’s when I’ll give it a 5 star review. In the meantime, I don’t think it will be worth it to keep on my phone because the interruptions from the ads ruin the fun. It’s too bad because I was really enjoying the game. 😕 I love this game so much,but the ads dont stop i just saw an ad about kick yhe buddy,but then the same kick the buddy ad comes up a few seconds later,ITS ANNOYING and i cant remove the ads so can you atleast have the option to skip?other than that i love this game and i have to rate five stars to get free mode and the t rex is not a t rex!!!!its a creatasaurs(sorry if I spelled that wrong)and can u have the option to eat the steak to heal and this game is really cheap and THE ADS MAKE ME DIE ","Dinosaur Simulator 3D: Free Jurassic Commando Game, Noor Ali Butt, Games, Adventure, Entertainment, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I greatly enjoyed the mechanic of having control of two characters and potentially having two different personalities between the two. Plus I feel this game gives me an experience that isn’t all that touched on too well. The ability to be the villain! I’ve played the academy for upcoming super villains and I enjoyed it my first time through. But ultimately it felt lacking in motivation. I entered the school because my mother was a villain? Here my character suffered a traumatic experience that caused serious mental and physical injuries. Also your choice of what villain you will be is a fine touch as well. And with how the ending appeared for me, I’m looking forward to a potential sequel. I can’t remember a time I read a story this quickly. It’s such an interesting world they’ve created and the characters are all so interesting. In the beginning it felt a little more like you could steer the story yourself but as things progressed I felt more like the character’s bitterness kind of overwhelmed your ability to choose. So my choices looked out of place with the story. Maybe that’s because of the answers I chose earlier on, I don’t know, but playing a full on villain while not getting the full picture about what happened to make your character want to destroy their former friends/allies broke some of my immersion. If I’m gonna be that vengeful to some seemingly decent folks, I kind of want more of a complete picture. Maybe I’d have learned more about the incident from their past with different choices. Also RO wise, for a player choosing to date guys but not wanting to have a romantic relationship with Ortega, the interactions got a little frustrating.  Kind of felt like he was the only real option and he was constantly thrown at you. Regardless of the things I didn’t love, I really adore Fallen Hero and will replay it. Also excited for the next book!! The good: You’re playing a character who is struggling emotionally.  I would say that she had a mild personality disorder (inability to trust other people) which was exacerbated by PTSD.  Your choices and the writing manage to force you to stay within the constraints of your mental illness, while still allowing you some leeway about how to react in particular situations.  Because of the skillful writing, you can feel some of her emotions, like you would in a good novel.  More generally, the author really does know how to write well.  Setting the scene and dialogue/banter are novel-quality, which is not the case in many CoG/Hosted Games.The bad: A lot of information crucial to your character is revealed piecemeal throughout the story.  I think some of it still hasn’t been revealed.  This includes her history (events that made her the way she is), her goals, and the practical plans to accomplish them.  Since your character would know all of these things, it left me feeling unable to fully absorb myself in her.  I could feel her emotions like she was a whole person, but when I tried to think like her, she was a cardboard cutout.

That said, and despite it being too short, it's still an okay adventure game. And I'd much rather these classic games were adapted than not, so three stars here. Please, do the very first Atlantis next, and don't skip anything! So apparently this version of the game skips about 95% of the content from the PC version. Missed dialogues, interactions and more. The game makes no sense to me and this is the only version I have played (googled a guide from gameboomers to see if I missed some stuff. Turns out I missed the whole story :/) Unlike a previous reviewer I like the graphics, though not the Near-East type world they create at the beginning of the game. Fortunately that world is left behind soon. Judging this game by comparing it to most games out there, I'm giving it five stars.  I love this type of straightforward, gimmickless  adventure game, and the occasional humor was nice.  But I got spoiled by some of the other Microids games out there, such as the two Dracula games and Amerzone, and this one seemed a bit more choppy and less consistent, probably because it contained more worlds.  I may also have a bias toward dark, Dracula-type themes. But I'll gladly replay this game before I play another silly hidden objects game.SPOILERSIf you're still wandering in the hills, look for a cave. If you have no stick to make a fire, it's because you haven't found the right stick yet. If the two sages don't answer your questions, it's because you haven't approached them in the right order. (""Come child"" means come ask ME the next question.)  If you want to win this game, don't just look straight ahead, look all around you, including the ground.

It is not the most original concept but it is handled well and there are quite a few elements that turn now mundane story tropes into something refreshing and almost new. Most importantly it was a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed reading through every line and page and I especially appreciated the length, allowing you to get drawn into the story and characters without feeling like it drags on. There are some errors in coding but nothing that won’t get sorted out within a few days. And perhaps even more so this was the first time since probably choice of robots that I did not feel like I had to restart on the first playthrough. The game is very good about working within your choices as long as you present consistency of character. It will still punish you on mistakes but even those are done so well that you feel like it’s just indeed another branch or path as opposed to a mistake. I loved the main character and playing as her and felt like my play style very well reflected in the writing. I don’t review things, but in my fever induced mania perhaps I’m turning over a new leaf. I’ve played lots of excellent Choice Of games, my favorites being the Heroes series, so you can probably see a trend here. But I don’t know if I’ve ever been as drawn into a world like I have with Superlatives. Weather Control is one of my favorite powers so that helps, and I genuinely enjoy leading a team where other games have only given you the facade of doing so, that I’ve played anyway. I like the characters, I’m genuinely interested to see what each one thinks and says, who they are as people and heroes. Now I’m not that far in, maybe chapter 5 or so, but everything is so consistent thus far that I’d be surprised if it took a nose dive. I’ll certainly review again once I’ve finished but I look forward to playing the rest with great aplomb. This game was awesome. I wish I could have gotten a little deeper into my romance with Hugh, but otherwise I have no complaints. I used to read choose your own adventure books as a kid. This is the first adult kind of version of that which I’ve really enjoyed. :) ","The Superlatives: Aetherfall, Choice of Games LLC, Games, Adventure, Books, Role Playing, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

To hear everything, to see everything! It brings back such AMAZING memories! We got to super bible bobble and so of course I had to download this game! The only issue is how do I drop back down from a ledge? Other than that, thank you for bringing this back into my life... I guess, who’ll I’m asking questions, how can I legit buy this game and not have to watch ads or get diamonds or anything? Also, most reviews here are from kids that cant be pleased. Please ignore them and their issues. I appreciate the classic game was brought to IOS, but the game has many problems. First is the graphical quality. The graphics look like they were rushed. It looks like they just typed in some stuff and left it like that. Second, I know this is a mobile game, but that doesn’t mean that we need gems to move on in the game. They could have something like credits, since it is an arcade game. Next would have to be the controls. They’re to hard to use, and seems like they’re in the wrong places. It’d be better to use a joystick like control on the left so that you can move and jump instead of pressing seperate buttons to do it. And the bubble button should be bigger too. Last would have to be the fact that the promotional things for this game tease multiplayer, something that isn’t actually shown in the game. Although it is hard to add multiplayer to a mobile game, there are ways it can be added gracefully. I feel like, the bad ending when you only play single player should have been added, because the whole original game was about teamwork. Other than that, the game plays mostly the same from the original. This brings back so many memories when I was a child, would play this for hours on the Nes, thank you for bring it to mobile, controls could be a little better but besides that it’s great and still to this day a lot of fun Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

I am a beekeeper myself (which is the main reason I downloaded the app), and honey bees cannot sting multiple times, usually are not aggressive, and form hives with wax to store brood and resources like pollen, nectar, and honey. I really enjoy playing this game, but it makes me sad that you mislabel it and maligned the name of honey bees! They're not scary- most are rather gentle if you don't bother them. Most people are afraid of bees, but it's a misconception. Again, I enjoy playing, but it makes me sad that people will think these attacking insects are honey bees. Would you please rename this app and possibly even make another simulation, one that is more accurate to honey bees? I would definitely play that! it’s a nice game really I have a time flying I can’t Pollinate flowers as a bee  this game is pretty good but can add multiplayer well the beehive  I want to pick up more pollen One at a time even though this is ########  it’s still pretty goodNot honeybees⭐️(Bee good) ","Honey Bee Simulator, Boris Tsarkov, Games, Adventure, Role Playing, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

The coco thing is not what I expected it to be I wait 7 hours for those to come and the option to get them should be when u have 0+ and the holding space of coco should be more than 5 coco so please make the storage of coco bigger and better. I thought u could talk to the tiny child nope u don't and we should be able to customize the child's eyes and clothes, please put that in and work on the game customization and other things but the bugs being fixed bruh it's fine no bugs!! I was searching my App Store and found this game it looked adorable and said you could interact with the little boy I thought this would be the best game ever the best I've ever played but no it's not this isn't even a game all you do is wait 50 minutes for chocolate bars? and tap around the screen with flowers or other stuff like that it's honestly really boring and I just would like if you could interact with the boy it's an adorable concept a great style to it but it says you can interact with the boy and you just can't this literally would be the best game ever if you can just interact with him fully like there's a little bubble above his head that says he's hungry/sleepy/ect. Or just be able to play games with the boy or be able to talk into the phone and he answers back through something like that it's adorable I will admit that but the layout is just flat out boring. And can I even named him? I can't choose what clothes to put on him or what color hair eyes he should have or even our storyline I can't do anything but tap the screen feed him chocolate what kind of pastime is this it's horrible just some mini games or. Any games you could possibly play with the boy or choose the clothes or stuff like that there's just no interaction is says in the description that you can but obviously you can't. I'm thinking about deleting the game so fix it up quick before nobody wants to get it anymore try your best -Safire PLZ!!!! Well it’s good and cute but.. u have to use REAL LIFE MONEY to GET DIAPERS? Just whyyyy. And for some reason the Watch button, which is for getting chocolate bars for the baby demon, it won’t work for me, I keep pressing it but it won’t show me an ad to get some chocolate, and we have to wait for like, idk but 53 minutes!? Why can’t it be ten minutes? Also the baby demon is cute but it’s so small, it’s the size of a toy tbh, but for me I feel like it takes a while to make the baby demon grow up, and I also have some ideas for the game! One, we should be able to name the baby, bc we don’t what to call it but a baby demon. And we should decorate the house, it’s so plain, just saying tho. And can we get coins to just buy diapers with the coins? Anyway the game is good but there are a lot of problems and good ideas that should be added to the game, the game is kinda like idle games, and their is nothing else to do basically, just accept my ideas, and I hope some of the updates will add some ideas Like naming the baby, and I’m sorry that this is so long, their are so many problems and I hate it, also my mom is kinda poor right now, so there should be a sale to get the diapers, like one penny, but I guess u won’t cuz u guys want to suffer, if u do that, now I’m going, bye bye! 😒 ","My cutie devil 【Otome game】, funnel, Games, Adventure, Simulation, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I too often cannot see the obvious staring me straight in the eye, and thus over complicate the search.  I love having hints that nudge you along in the journey without revealing the answer.  This games’ hint system, which required you to watch a video that I would not have minded doing so, simply would not function.  To move forward in this game I found myself referring to a few walkthroughs.  And I am glad I did, because the game is fun, wonderfully drawn, comical and had lots of hidden Easter eggs to reward a players effort.  4 stars because the hint system would not function; otherwise 5.  I enjoyed this a lot. Loved the graphics, story, and unique puzzles. The only suggestion would be to make it more obvious to move on to the next level. I would’ve never known to start over with a new game to finish playing if I wouldn’t have looked online for help. Why not just make it part of the journey? I’m afraid some people would totally miss out on all the extra fun tidbits. I liked how it shows your achievements so you know if you’ve completed all the puzzles. I will be playing part2!

Eipix is known for innovative, engaging, high quality adventures that give the gamer their money's worth. Unfortunately this was not the case this time, for as this mystery lacked the pizazz, suspense and intrigue that one usually associates with any game developed by this brilliant company. Annoying for this reviewer that at various times throughout play of game, one would encounter lack of sound accompaniment to written screen character verbalizations, in addition to not always being able to use map when so desired (Map would suddenly disappear from screen for some unknown reason, only to later reappear for usage). Finally, play time not as long as usual expected from Eipix productions.Thank you for your continued support & following. Happy New Year!~Kamen Rider The HOS and the mini games were so different than most others...and fun.  Worth the $, decent playing time. My only complaint is, and it's not really a complaint, is once you found the globes...they didn't Do anything. Didn't add to the story, didn't give extra background to the story or characters no reward to finding them all. Don't quite get the point but nothing worth losing a star over. Good game!

Beautiful graphics and sound (although I prefer the TurboGrafx-16 music over any other version, sad that it was not available as a music option) and lots of fun to play again.If I could change one thing, it would be to add a FIXED gamepad on the screen.  They do have the option for a ""fixed pad"" but it can be anywhere on the screen.  Too much freedom in that has led me to trouble many times, and I know I'm not the only one who had this comment.Otherwise, brilliant game and I hope they bring some of the other Ys games to iOS!  Well done.  😊 Love all things Ys, except this (chronicles) port—which I now despise. On a platform with d-pads and buttons chronicles is epic, the mobile ports however (what with having to drag your finger around and/or mash spots in the corners) is unplayable garbage for anyone with hands larger than an eight year old thanks to how easy it is for said actions to obscure ones field of view—which typically results in repeated death during boss fights (to the point of rage).My review: this/these port(s) should be buried in the desert next to NES ET.

To resist the powerful Demon Lord, God created a human. Sacrificing his own body to seal the Demon Lord, God assigned the role of guarding that seal to the chosen one. Through an eternity of time, the seal has weakened, and a window to the underworld, ""Dark Gates"" have appeared in multiple locations.  Monsters start to invade the land. To break free from the doomed fate of man, they will rise and destroy every last ""Dark Gate""… ** Overview of Dark Gate This game is a fantasy RPG. You must destroy the rifts where the monsters are coming from, each called a ""Dark Gate."" The hero Leo joins his ally Sandy on a mission to destroy the ""Dark Gates"". A world full of adventures and powerful foes unravels during your assignment of destroying the Dark Gates. FEATURES ‐ Unfold a fast-paced, automated, and intense battle system ‐ Different endings based on your choices in game ‐ Over 70 different job classes ‐ A full roster of characters. The story develops based on who is in your party. This game is an RPG you can enjoy with an intense battle system. There are many jobs and skills to choose from as you level up characters. Choosing the right strategy becomes the key to defeating monsters. With multiple endings, you can enjoy replaying this RPG again and again! *This game features some in-app-purchase content.

However, this game has solid gameplay but a poor story. You will tire of the dialogue quickly, especially when Leo says, ""Leo's the name, RPG's my game."" In a way you can try to see how campy the dialogue is, in a sort of so bad it's good way. Darkgate just has you tap on tiers to change to stronger jobs and manually set individual abilities, so it is a bit confusing at first (with no tutorial). Fortunately it becomes simple to use once you get used to activating passive abilities and skills. You can also speed up battles and you basically break up auto battle with commands/abilities rather than input turns, so the fighting is nice. Fortunately, the game is an improvement on Grinsia because it has better menus and you can quickly enter/exit towns and dungeons. I do like how Darkgate lets you change the difficulty at any time in case there are spikes or you need a level 1 character to level up quickly. In short, play it while it is on sale if you need to laugh at something or are in an rpg drought. Another Hit-Point game that I just absolutely LOVE. It's probably the most complex of the Kemco RPGs, mainly because of the job system. You'll have to constantly change jobs depending on where you're going and what type of enemies you'll be facing, and it can be quite daunting at first. But once you get into it, it really shines.

Create. Conquer.,4.6 • 96.7K Ratings,Free,#74 in Role Playing,"October 13, 2020","I am so glad this game popped up in ads online a few weeks ago. I have always been a huge fan of the computer and Xbox Elder Scrolls series. I thought since it was mobile that it may be a disappointment, BUT I absolutely love it. Amazing graphics for mobile, a nice storyline, it’s just like the other versions. I just defeated the Lich king or whatever and saved my city. I hope something new comes up in the storyline soon as now I only have small side mission quests to do from the board, which is completely repetitive. Perhaps when I fill up more empty slots in my city, more quests will pop up. We will see. People who complain about this being a p2p game are very impatient and/or unknowledgable. I am level 36 and for the most part getting there was f2p and without difficulty. I got some revival scrolls in the beginning levels, but that was with gems given to me in the game for free. Eventually I thought I might need a lot of gems or something later on and bought a cheat at a great deal with gems and revival scrolls that was 100 usd for only 20 usd. And guess what? I still haven’t even used those gems yet because it has so far been unnecessary. And only a handful of those scrolls which also one don’t really need although convenient. This is practically pretty much a f2p game. Those who complain it isn’t are probably (hopefully) kids who are impatient or don’t study all the parts to the game to see how to accomplish without paying. I've played this for awhile now. I also read all the reviews where people are saying is boring or hard around level 9. Here's the deal, this game is awesome if played correctly I'm currently level 24, with my town about level 7 ( just a bit under ), I don't know if people are not building their towns up, but that actually expands the game, brings in new missions, upgrading shops gives better options to craft or buy with in game currency. Early on when things are easy upgrade your inventory slots and chest capacity with the free premium gems they give you ( I get a lot free fighting in the dungeons) I have over 700 now, never bought anything. Time your chest timers around your work day, open gold while you sleep, never run into waiting issues. As far as combat and  complaining about dying, here's a tip get the healing dodge and upgrade it, choose your talents and perks wisely, craft health absorbing armor and jewelry, with the right loadout, and proper potion planning, no quest is too difficult, the challenging ones are harder because they're supposed to be, you'll have a wonderful feeling of accomplishment when they drop a free legendary chest on you.I'm level 24, all eleven gear, rings and necklace, usually have 15-20 various chests to cycle through, over 700 premium gems saved up from free drops, haven't spent a dime of real life currency.Play smart play often, this is an unbelievable free offering from the elder scrolls franchise!!!! I played for a month before writing this review because I understand it is still a beta release, Blades, in my opinion is by far the best game on a cellphone and trust me that I should be a critic I have played and deleted thousands of games. With all that being said Blades has amazing graphics that I would expect on a console, the gameplay is amazingly polished especially because you can tell they are improving it daily, when I first started Blades would shut down or freeze every so often (once a day) and now I cannot remember the last time that has happened. The pace of the game seems perfect to me as some days I don’t have as much time I will open the treasure chests and construct new buildings in my city and on the days I want to grind for gold, material or weapons etc etc... Blades surely lets me decide my own pace. I believe Bethesda is by far the best game developing company ever to make games so this is not a impartial  review, I already knew I would love this game as I have from everything they have ever released. So far the only thing I would like added to Blades is the ability to change between first person and third person as so many of Bethesda games have done in the past, it is amazing that this game is free because I dropped many other games off of my phone, Blades is all I need. Thank you Bethesda and also a thanks goes out to whoever read this book I just wrote.

I thought it would be more challenging & engaging like the other IOS games so I didn’t hesitate to buy it. I noticed it says ages 4 & up, well now I know why, it definitely feels more like a kids game to me. I wish I had waited before purchasing this one to make sure it was like the games I love to play, Botanica is still my favorite, I love how you can interact with every object whereas in this game you kinda poke & have 2 or 3 choices, & that feel like a challenge to me I guess. 😔 I am usually not a mean person towards reviews, but I just HAVE to point this out.When I first got this game, I had high hopes. But seeing every little speck and corner of this game made my brain automatically Think: “I’m doing something completely wrong. Am I?” But it was too late. My finger had already pressed the download button. And I just KNEW I was about to go on a terrible ride. No character in this game I cared about. They all felt like a wasted level idea. Music just sounds like some random sounds all mashed together to fit the  situation. Story is probably the worst of this review. A little orange monster named Chuchel trying to get a cherry that is always out of his reach? That sounds as simple as Mario trying to rescue Princess Peach! Sorry for all my negativity, but of all the games Animata Design has made, PLEASE skip this one! PLEASE!!!!!!! I was expecting a more challenging and compelling game, I really enjoyed all the other Amanita design games, the only games I have purchased from the store and World of Goo. I liked Chuchel but more for kids, it is a funny game, some scenes are really hilarious, but It took me 15 days to finish, and not because it was hard, it was because I didn’t even remember it was there. Not like Samorost, Machinarium or Botanicula, for those I couldn’t stop until the end. And the music was not that good either. The characters are cute for what I said, kids. I was disappointed when I realized that it was just that, a funny game. If you have children under 7 they will love this game.

‎Pink Princess House Craft Game,"Once upon a time, a little princess decided to build a lovely pink mansion. She wanted it to look like a doll house because she adores toys and dolls. But the point is that most of these toys and dolls, she seized from children! This naughty princess also took all your toys which you now need to find and retrieve.  Depending on which character you choose to play, you will have a different set of toys to find in the Pink Princess House. If you select to play as a boy, you will then have to search for cars. And if you take on a girl’s role, you will have to find a pony and all dolls (rest assured there are really many of them to keep you busy and entertained)!  Get ready to play through an amazing doll house explore adventure! But bear in mind – the capricious pink princess and her friends are not willing to give their toys and dolls just for a thank you!  To outwit the girls, you will have to move around the pink mansion very quickly, and there are a lot of secret places to hide. The pink princess hates to play hide-and-seek – make her angry by hiding properly, say, under a bed, a table or in a wardrobe!  The Pink Princess House is awesomely huge, which makes it a perfect place to play hide-and-seek. This mansion features several floors, a large garden with a beautiful fountain, multiple rooms with posh furniture, and delicious pink blocks walls – a true embodiment of a pink princess dream!  Explore every corner in the princess doll house because your toys can be anywhere! Make sure you visit a store, too. There you will buy all necessary stuff to play tricks on the pink princess and her friends. In the store, you can find a plethora of useful things including a cute puppy that can bring a pony or a car to you, a potion of invisibility, the princess’s pet cat, and lots of other valuable and interesting items.  Once you have discovered your every toy and doll, your next objective will be to find the button, opening the exit door, and escape from the pink house. We highly recommend using the mansion’s map to easily navigate in this location.  On first sight, you may think it is a game for girls, but it is absolutely not! You can opt to play this game in the boy mode and search for cars, play hide-and-seek with girls, drink a speed potion, and run around the pink blocks estate like a lightning! When you get to a terrace, you will see for yourself that this mansion is a perfect doll house!  It is essentially a craft game, in the world of which, everything is block-shaped, and there are no round forms! If you are a fan of craft games, then you definitely should try the Pink Princess House game, which is made of hundreds of pink blocks!  Before you try to escape from the pink princess dream house, make sure you have explored every spot here because if you fail to find all missing toys, the exit button will not get activated. The house map will help you understand which room you have not visited yet. A pony, dolls, and cars are very small so that you should be very attentive while exploring the rooms. If you have difficulties finding the toys, just call up the puppy – he is always ready to help you.  Pink princess house is a game for girls and boys alike!

Besides that, this game offers an excellent range of game play at a very steady pace. It gives you reachable goals, a free boost up to lvl 1000, provides fun and difficult challenges, and I have paid $0 in total. You don’t NEED to buy the ‘Starter Pack’ to progress. You just need to play. I’ve been playing for a few weeks, logging on for my daily gems that the devs GIVE you, leveling things up, and repeating. It’s not mindless, because it still gives you daily quests to complete. It is a fun, easy game to pick up that you definitely do NOT have to pay to advance. However, I’m not saying you SHOULDN’T pay, if you want to help out the devs with all of their hard work, you definitely CAN pay.All in all, great game, I’m on level 2500 and steadily rising every day. Wish I had more bottles, but it’s a minor hiccup in an all-around great game! I’ve spent a few days playing this and I have to say I’m quite surprised. One of the better incremental games out there. I’d go so far as to say it has the potential of something like Tap Titans 2 if it’s done right. “Premium” currency is easy to get, yes there are ads but what game doesn’t have them. This one doesn’t really throw them in your face tho. And you don’t really miss out on much if you don’t watch them all. I’d personally like to see something of a guild/clan setup at some point, it’s one of the features I’d say is missing. Otherwise, and excellent idle or semi-idle game to play in my book. I’ve played this game for a little over a week now, and I can safely review this game. It’s fun, has all the idle elements that you’d like to see. Upgrade system, different currencies, raids. But it’s greediness gets in it’s own way. What do I mean? Well do you want a new weapon? On that’s preferable Unique or Legendary? Well there’s only ONE way to acquire this. Either a single roll with 500 gems, (which is paid currency, and a fair amount of it. Roughly $5) that has a 7% of receiving decent items. Don’t want to roll? Well there’s another way to get the weapons! Buy them! For $10-$99!! That’s nonsense. I can’t play the game at a certain point because the upgrades that help progress to the next level, all require $. That’s just one atrocity among many in this game. Truthfully, I have no idea why this game has more than 3 stars. This is truly a mediocre game, with a shameful cash grab system. All in all, I say **** this developer. Make a game playable before adding the most shameless cash grab I’ve seen. Shame shame.

‎Burly Men at Sea,"Burly Men at Sea is a folktale about a trio of large, bearded fishermen who step away from the ordinary to seek adventure. With gameplay halfway between a visual novel and a point-and-click adventure, the branching story carries its ungainly heroes into waters where lurk creatures from Scandinavian folklore and other misadventures. You play as storyteller and wayfinder, shaping a custom tale that begins again where it ends. BRANCHING STORY: Play through multiple choice-driven adventures, each designed to be completed in a single sitting. INNOVATIVE CONTROLS: Shape the narrative through a unique, draggable viewport and your interactions within it.   PLAYFUL AESTHETIC: Colorful art style with handcrafted animation, set to a whimsical original soundtrack inspired by folk music of the far north. No in-app purchases or ads. … “The closest thing I’ve played to an interactive fairy-tale.” —The Telegraph “Artful interplay of visual minimalism, waggish writing and hilarious but also haunting sound effects generated by gorgeous a cappella voices. 5/5” —TIME “9/10” —Pocket Gamer … Burly Men at Sea is the second game from married duo Brain&Brain, developed during their own adventures as nomads and erstwhile farmhands.",https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/26/a2/61/26a2616b-1473-c864-25d6-a85d03ee577e/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,A folktale misadventure.,4.4 • 208 Ratings,$4.99,,"March 5, 2020","We’re totally charmed by this eclectic adventure. Inspired by Scandinavian myth, Burly Men at Sea unfolds like an interactive storybook, letting you discover its quirky characters, dreamy music, and colorful artwork at your own pace. Multiple paths offer plenty of surprises we won’t spoil, but this story of mystery and magic is thoughtful fun however many times you play. I have to laugh. I’ve had this game on my iPhone for months and never got around to playing it. Well, out of nowhere, I finally played through it this morning on my new iPhone Xs Max. And then the app updates this afternoon to be “properly outfitted for the latest iPhone models”. Talk about timing. Guess I’ll have to play through it once more!Was a lot of fun. Beautifully done, love the artwork and especially the sounds/music. Is this a puzzler or brain teaser in any way? Not really. Just good, clean, whimsical fun. And it’s well worth it. I may even end up ordering a book for my wife’s kindergarten class. Burly Men at Sea is a cut above most of the cobbled-together apps and games you will find in the App Store. It's full of delightful surprises, secret opportunities, careful details and gorgeous art work. If you're wanting to be immersed in ancient Nordic mythology with as a burly, bearded sailor, this is the adventure for you. Fun for kids, parents, wanderers, explorers, this game offers something for all. You can even have a picture book of your adventure created if you know where to look!

‎A Street Cat's Tale : SE,"Mama cat has gone, how is a baby kitten to survive every day on the streets? ※※iOS does not support play data linkage from free ver. ※※ ■ Food It’s inevitable that most cats living on the streets will starve. They often dig through trash to find whatever leftovers they can get. Or sometimes eat delicious canned food from nice humans if they are lucky. ■ Many NPCs Many NPCs with their own unique personalities. Listen to their stories, get them what they want and they might feed you. ■ NPCs provide multiple endings What will happen to the kitty? Will the kitty end up living with a human? Or stick to the streets? It's up to you to guide this poor kitty!  *Feemodev donates 10% of the profits from the game to Cat/Dog shelters. *Supported languages : English, Japanese, Korean *Language updated: Portuguese, Spanish,  Russian, French has been added. (Please understand, that google translator was the best we could do.) [Frequently asked questions] Q)Why is this game so SAD?! Isn’t the game supposed to be fun and cute?  this game is so traumatizing. A)This game contains the reality of the street cat’s life. Of course, the content of the game is somewhat rough or sad.  And we understand your feeling coming from that.  but we don’t have any plan to change the game or ease the violence because there's a message we wanted to send through this game.  we made this game because we love cats, not because we hate them.  I hope that you understand that there are such aspects of the street cat’s life.    Thank you.  Q)I always get sad endings, how do I get happy endings?  A) Instead of ending ‘solitude’ and 'rainbow bridge’. (Ending 5,6) The endings can be seen by achieving an intimacy level 7 with a specific NPC(characters).  However, you can only see one ending at a time,  so if you target one character at a time, you’ll get the ending you want! Q)There’s only to ‘drop' or ‘eat’ with the item, how do I pick up and give it to the NPC? A) If you saw the option to eat or drop.  it means you already picked up an item.  talk to the characters and select 'give present' while holding an item. Q)The cat is too slow and the hunger shrink so fast! A) Upgrading the house will help you.  Hunger, HP, movement speed increase each time you upgrade your home. Q)Where can I get ‘gloves’ and ‘band-aid’? A) the gloves and band-aid can be obtained from the store near Doggo.  And they are 50% chance each to get.  Q)Why do I have to start all over after the game ends? A) If the game’s over,  We assumed that you have already finished the game.  All the progress will be reset except with a house upgrade.  And we think that it’s going to be strange if Everyone would recognize the kitty  After crossing the rainbow bridge or get adopted by someone. xD Q)I want to help translating your game!  A) First of all, we apologize that we were not able to support various languages at present. A lot of players have emailed us about language support. Until now, we were refusing any supports for various reasons.

So often, it feels like i've played the same game over and over. This game had new things to do, not just a simple hunt for the hidden picture game. The hidden items, though, were well hidden and challenging. This is definitely a good game for adults who need a challenge.  Judging by the previous version's low scores this must have been greatly improved for v2.I played it on an iPad; it would not go well on a smaller screen. I didn't have any issues with the game. These high def games take up a lot of memory. Just running your iPad takes memory, so if you are running short then your game will crash.  Delete some of the stuff you don't use or like anymore.  The only complaint I had is that I paid $5.00 for a game that took me less than an hour to complete...much shorter than HDO's other games. Now that is robbery. Ok if I could get formalin. Please fix my game or refund my money. Now I can't pick up the bell by the clock. Do not even see a bell.     I can pick up the bell but now I can't pick up the las blue arrow next to the barrel.

I love that there is constant gameplay. There is so much intel on everything, makes you actually understand what you need to do for leveling up. I will say there are some stuff I would love to include, such as... Having a trading system for a better way to buy stuff especially rations. I always have those going down. And the villages don’t restock as fast when I am doing back to back events. I would also like if we could actually do quests in multiplayer. I feel like that would be awesome. Because of just how much power they hold, it would be nice to have some backup. But this app literally contains so much stuff to adventure in. You can interact with literally everything! I love that I can play with my friend and help them battle out some of the creatures around the map. I do say, you might have to watch tutorials just to get the basics. But then it is like an easy reflex to figure everything out. And the graphics of this game is also out of this world. It is kinda laggy being in multiplayer and on call. But all of that I still have an excellent gameplay. And I love the character design, thought I think the main characters could have more avatar options. I wish we could decorate our main character or find people who could give us clothes to buy. Thank you for this game it is such a joy to just have something to do and leveling up my characters! In my many years of trying to find games to play on the phone and ACTUALLY being satisfied and having something to play till 3 am. Genshin Impact has shown me that I waited long enough, the game asked me to write a review but I just couldn’t stop playing at the time. I have a few suggestions but the game doesn’t need major changes the updates are spontaneous but that is to come of a new game so it’s not a complaint, if you’re looking for a game that you can like and that has beautiful graphics along with fighting mechanics then this is your game. With the dungeons and monsters and many different places to visit it’s even fun just running around looking at the world, although one suggestion I have is that instead of just food to heal your party members why not add craftable health potions and such so my character doesn’t feel sick when eating so much 😂. The purity and smooth play of the game is phenomenal though, I’ve already suggested it to a dozen people and I think this game has greater potential, on the other hand I was opening this was a open world multiplayer aswell, but the story says otherwise. If you need to relax and relieve stress this is the game, but if you want to play with friends and find people to meet you better have them added or you’ll be alone like I am! All in all having a better friends system would be awesome but the game itself is phenomenal! Paimon is so Kawaii!!!!! So. The only problem I have with this game is the overwhelming lag that this game brings to the phone. If you guys could really fix this, I’d be very happy, cause I was Interested to see all of the amazing animations that you guys could bring to such a magnificent game as this one. Plus, it should be brought to my attention that you should get the material for wishes easier. I have been trying my hardest, but I always seem to get nothing, although I just do quests and stuff that don’t have them. (I understand that this is a very early version of the game, and your improving it.) Also, VERY. good job on the character models for this game. Honestly, this is the first ever good RPG game, making the fact that all the others were not very good, since it limits you to a lobby, not experiencing the world, and just fighting. I would also like to add, something That would improve this game a lot is if you guys had different Customizations. Like Clothes, Wing Gliders (there are 3 available so, I guess I have a wrong point there) And much more! It would seem to me so fun if there was a whole variety to this game. Also, Amazing game on the characters. I really like all of them, and I favor this game a lot. As being one of your big fans, please take these ideas into suggestion and improve the game early on! I would love to see this game being one of the most played games in the world ! ! I hope the best of luck to you guys! Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

Without a map, I'm lost! The rest is pretty typical. I keep thinking with each scene change I'll find a map, but no luck so far. Don't know how far I'll go with it. I've been a huge fan of BFG for a VERY long time now, but as of late, they are a totally different company, and one I really don't like. First, they don't give you the first chapter free anymore (if they had, I would have seen that I had already downloaded and paid for this game, but they re-advertised it and I thought it was a new game, and since the first chapter wasn't FREE, I was forced to buy it before finding out I've already played it). Second, game prices jumped from two dollars a game to seven dollars a game over night?!? Perhaps this company is going for all new customers and couldn't care less about the old ones, because, as an old customer, I'm getting fed up with these antics. So I play the game and then it gets stuck. I cannot do anything. So I say ok lets restart it and start again form the beginning. (After playing it for two in a half days)!

It's a shame too because it has a very cool vibe to it, but the game is ruined by the fact that it is impossible to not take continual damage and not die over and over and over....There are much more enjoyable platformers out there for iOS like Ammo Pigs, Shadow Blade, Star Knight, Paper Monsters Recut etc.This game just isn't fun.

I find this game hard to play because of technical things. Some of these thing where probably never an issue on pc. Switching it to be an app must be a daunting task. I’m sure developers did their best, but some things are better with a mouse and keyboard. There are two glitches in this game. The first one is that when you put bottles in the recycling machine, the bottles will float on the screen (not in your inventory) for the rest of the game. The second glitch is that an error alert will pop up and exit you out of the game and you'll have to start the entire game over. The second glitch, however, is avoidable by purposely making the first glitch happen early on in the game. This is perfectly fine because you can always get coins from Mr. Baldini by bringing him produce. As a result, I loved this game as a kid and still do! And as long as you get that first glitch to happen early on in the game, you're golden.

‎60 Parsecs!,"Atomic Space Age was a blast! Until it became the Post-Apocalyptic Space Age. Your space station is about to explode and you only have 60 seconds before things get messy. What (or who) will you grab before you make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle and begin your journey into THE GREAT UNKNOWN? This is 60 Parsecs!, a dark comedy sci-fi adventure set in the Atomic Space Age - complete with all the Cold War paranoia, chrome-plated wall accents and cockroaches with space helmets. Lead a crew of woefully unprepared astronauts, equipped with whatever junk - sorry - ""supplies"" you can grab before blasting off, on a journey across the cosmos that's best described as misguided. Make the best of it, while dealing with soup shortages and other horrors of outer space. Will you have what it takes to find a new home and survive? Bon voyage! SCAVENGE & EVACUATE With only 60 seconds before nukes reduce the space station to floating particles in the vacuum of space, frantically grab whatever supplies and crew you can before getting out of there. You never know when that sock puppet will come in handy. SURVIVE & DECIDE Space funerals are inconvenient, so try to avoid dying where possible. Use your limited supplies and (hopefully not limited) wits to make difficult choices and ensure your survival, even though the odds are definitely stacked against you. EXPLORE & CRAFT Duct tape fixes all problems, but how do you fix (or at least craft) duct tape? Chart expeditions to find resources, craft survival essentials and explore strange new worlds in a procedural, very-much-permadeath adventure. LEAD & PROTECT As captain, it's your duty to keep the crew happy - they're less likely to kill you that way. Manage relationships as you watch them grow closer and hopefully not throw each other out the airlock.",https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/43/2e/9e/432e9ed3-884e-5187-3d95-6f593934ae14/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-9-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.5 • 62 Ratings,$3.99,#121 in Adventure,"September 4, 2020","I’ve played both 60 Seconds & 60 Parsecs, and I’d have to say that 60 Parsecs is the superior title.1. The CharactersIn 60 Seconds, the family doesn’t have much personality. They have names and appearances, but nothing unique about them! In 60 Parsecs, each crew member as a special personality and different strengths and weaknesses, as well as more defining physical features. 2. The Story60 Seconds has you stay in a shelter due to a nuclear bomb to wait until you are rescued. 60 Parsecs has you launch into space inside a shuttle as Earth is bombed into destruction, and you must find somewhere to live. 60 Parsecs clearly wins in this category. 3. The Gameplay60 Parsecs updates the original formula with a crafting system, additional areas to travel, more characters and more! 60 Seconds main things to do are go on expeditions, make a choice, and ration. 60 Parsecs expands on the initial design and increases its quality.In conclusion, 60 Parsecs is a considerable step up from 60 Seconds (a game I enjoyed). I think this game is great and anyone who liked 60 Seconds with love 60 Parsecs. It’s really good as most of the other reviews have said but there’s is this one part I think is a bug. On the stormy planet, if the old alien alien guy comes to ask for power no matter what you say, yes or no it will always say you had to decline. I hope this gets fixed so I can get an ending at that point! Game was really good except that it didn’t record any progress in the Records Section, I built lots of stuff but the records were all Zeros’s and showed none of the progress I had made, I was able to save a video to my photo album but when I clicked to save my adventure to Facebook after finishing, the game crashed and when I loaded it to try again it wouldn’t let me because the game save was gone and would only let me start a new game.I hope you fix this because when you make progress in a game it should show up in the game.This game could use a patch or two to fix those issues.And maybe a way to store more than one game save.

I feel like most pr teams don’t read these. These guys either actually read the reviews or realized on their own that there was an issue, and fixed it fairly quickly so either way I’m a fan. Five stars.I love this game and have all three stars on all levels (minus the ones in Halloween Spooner Street, but including the completion of Grayson Morebees Camp Slashenchop ones) and all I have to say is that the glitches with each update are too frustrating for progress. I beat all of the Halloween event levels, but don’t know where to go to craft my items to obtain my rewards seeing as they have disappeared from Stewie’s backpack once the event started. To make it worst I am #1 on the event leader boards, so I’d like to reap what I’ve sewn! You are able to craft them once you have gotten all three items and the pop up at the bottom of the screen shows what you have collected, however if you miss that second and a half window, there’s no where to go to claim your prize. I’m a loyal player and still come back to replay levels and complete quests while I wait for new levels to be added within the next update (contrary to popular opinion I understand this takes time). On top of all this, there are only ten days left in the event so please fix this before it is over! Please? Hi there, we are sorry that you have this issue. We would like to take an opportunity to address this issue. Please contact us so we can discuss this in greater detail.**From your game go to the Settings Menu and select the Support Button.We look forward to speaking with you. Only giving 5 stars so this can be seen. Left a review a few days ago, but looks like it didn't go through or got removed. So, again, this game is a lot of fun and occupies a lot of time, but it’s SO money hungry! The levels come close to nearly impossible (especially Jeromes/The Chicken’s levels) Like, how are you supposed to collect Stewies cups when your only getting Brian’s bones and Lois’s drinks the whole time and the freezer literally drops 2 of Stewie’s cups every 10 mins! I was stuck on that without any boosters left for 4 days straight! I hate when you do the challenges, that are already next to impossible without 50 boosts to help you, and once you finally beat it, you realize that if you lose the next round, you have to go back to level one and spend days tryna beat it AGAIN! It’d be nice if you could grab some coins in this game pretty frequently without having to buy a bundle pack for $6-$12 or more! Once your lives are gone, realize you have no boosts, no coins, not enough gems...You can’t help but put the game down and forget about it for weeks at a time! I swear these levels are rigged to take soooo long so that you’ll finally lose patience and buy a bundle pack! It’s not worth it! Fun game, but the fun doesn’t last long at all!! I love this game! My only complaint is that the three challenges often have star requirements or a requirement to complete a task within a new level - that's great, but what about those of us who have no new levels to complete and who have collected all available stars? There should be an option to ask for a new challenge once we have completed all challenges that could be completed. Until new levels are added, those challenges are the only reasons to play levels I've already completed, so if I can't get new challenges until the old ones expire, then there's nothing for me to do.I was also curious about the picture of the level with the Greased-Up Deaf Guy - where is this in the game? Why is there a picture of a level that doesn't exist? Is it going to be released soon? I like new types of levels - they're fun! Hi there, we are sorry that you have this issue.

This gets frustrating at times, especially when I am trying to get one more game in.  I would have to click multiple times on something for it to work.  I know it’s not my WiFi, because my computer works, I know it’s not storage because other apps that take up more storage works.  Please fix this.  Thank you.I am currently using an iPhone 7 with an IOS as 11.3.1I’ve been looking at the reviews more and I have come up with some ideas to keep the game fun even when you have it all.  Add multiplayer and each player has 5 points, they will use these points to buy boosts or to just upgrade their stuff.  Then, they will start until they both lose.  And with the money they just earned they could either buy more boosts or buy a new weapon if they have enough.  Next comes round two and that will be the last round, whoever lasts the longest wins.Another idea: Make it to where you can compete against your friends and you can keep all your own stuff, but they will just keep going until they both lose.I hope these ideas will be put to the game because I would really like to help the creators of this game.  Thanks for at least reviewing. 👍 The game works great, I had it when I was younger and it was always fun, so I got it again to keep playing. However, I can’t buy anything in the store, which makes the game a bit boring since I can’t upgrade anything. I just downloaded the game and I’m running it on iOS 12.0 on an iPhone. Please fix!! So the actual game works fine. You press and hold it and when you let go, it smashes the people and objects. But when you get the shop screen and try to buy something, it’s like the buttons don’t work. You have to press it a couple of times for it to come up and then it goes away when you press too many times. It’s very irritating and the game would be fine with this simple fix. Thanks.

I use an iPad on iOS 7.0.2 and I have no clue what to do. If I could fix the problem and get my skins back I would appreciate it very much and give this app a five star rating. If i have to update to iOS 8.1.1 I will try, but I prefer not to do so.

Only complaint I can find is the graphics make some things hard to see, but that actually adds to the challenge. Multiple endings, plus amazingly enough developer offers soft reset with anything less than the “true” ending which is SO awesome, I rarely replay games just for a two second different ending, but this game lets you reset to right before you ended, so endings, and included extra puzzles, are totally worth playing! The game is overall very well done. The puzzles are challenging and make you think. While some will be obvious others will really challenge you. The game strikes a good balance as well with the hint system. Need a hint? Watch an ad. Still not enough? Ask for the answer. This system seemed extremely fair given the game is free. If I’m not paying for the game this is an excellent way to handle creating value for the developer. One complaint is although the graphics are good they try and obfuscate things by blending them into the background too much. I’m a veteran escape game player, and am bored with the same old cookie cutter games that don’t require thinking - just finding stuff and putting it in other stuff. This one makes you think outside the box and really problem solve. It’s tricky and I had to use the hints more than I’d like to admit, but I appreciate the progressive hints that don’t just give you the answer right away. Sometimes it was for stuff that I should have been able to figure out on my own, and others that just plain had me stumped. I’m looking forward to more from this developer! 👍🏻 ","Rime - room escape game -, izumiArtisan, Games, Entertainment, Puzzle, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I’ve been following your stuff for a while now and have downloaded all your games. This one in particular is quite possibly one of the best puzzle games I’ve played so far. Not only does it change art styles constantly, but the music changes as well (both the art and music are beautiful as well). My favorite part, though, has to be the very unorthodox methods of solving puzzles. You have the normal variation of touch gestures, but you also have to move the phone around, shake it, use the volume buttons and the charging cable, etc. I love how it tells a story, too. The narrative is great. This is quite honestly one of my all time favorite mobile games and I am looking forward to future games. More art than game, immersive, and just great. I don’t know how to describe it other than a mysterious collage of everyday things blended into a puzzle game / story. It’s hard to understand at first but you get what you have to do clearly by the end. It’s pretty easy to do which is nice, this game’s focus isn’t on difficulty. Oh and the constantly changing music brings the whole thing to life and changes the atmosphere of each section. Reminds me a little of Vignettes in that way.I may be misinterpreting it but it seems like the story is about creativity and possibly imagination. And actually that’s kinda what the entire game is about.I can’t really describe the charm and intrigue to this game with words, so play it for yourself! I absolutely adored this game. I have never played anything like it before! Beautiful design, inventive puzzles, excellent soundtrack.... This game has everything you need to get lost in another world that is magical and moving. No instructions are given but you really don’t need any. Just pay attention. But don’t get too wrapped up in memorizing every detail, you only need to notice one thing at a time. And if you miss something, there are helpful clues you can come back to at any time. I recommend playing this game when you’re not terribly busy so that you can fully experience the process but if you want to play it in small bits and pieces, that’s okay too.

The left and right button are too close to each other for, at least, me. At some points I would click one but since they are so close to each other, the system/game thinks I'm trying to press both and so Frisk won't move. And with that happening, I keep dying on the spikes and bones. This is still a great game but it would be nice to have the left and right buttons a little more away from each other...  :/ Undertale in my opinion is one of the best indie games out there because how the story holds up the characters are pretty good the locations have beautiful scenery to it end it still holds up to this day even if the fandom is crap I think it’s kind of a clever idea of making Undertale in the style of super Mario Bros but there are a couple of levels which I couldn’t get through Level 13 in the ruins has to be the worst of them because there are literally spikes you have to avoid and it’s tricky as hell I couldn’t even jump over them with Papyrus shooting those blue bones overall it’s a fine one but sometime later it might need some improvement on the hard levels ","Super Frisk, Kai Long Alan Du, Games, Adventure, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

The game is kind of like if overwatch and fortnite had a baby that was much more interesting to play. So what is the number 1 thing all fps players love? Cosmetics, something this game will offer for free in daily login  challenges and the season pass itself (even if you don’t pay). But what if you want to buy the season pass and your parents say no? Just save up, the free season pass will also offer the in game currency as a reward along with the login thing (which comes in generous amounts, but it would still take some time to save up for). I think as long as they reward people who level up their pass with decent rewards everyone is happy. I like the different game modes especially ranked, even though the randoms on my team give me a headache- it’s still fun and challenging. I await for the new features the devs add! I hope we gain a chat system or clans or even the ability to make friends and form teams, because in a team based game working together is necessary, along with having teammates you can depend on! So I hopped on this game thinking it was going to be another fun 5v5 fast paced arcade game to pass time and have fun. The first couple of games I noticed how off the controls and sensitivity are and how the fire modes have horrible aim on all sensitivity’s (no it’s not me, I played plenty of first person shooters and never have the issue with aiming.) when shooting it accelerates horribly and slowly even on the highest setting and goes faster at the worst times, it’s unbalanced. The game is also rigged, TDM goes up to 20 kills however the game ends in the end and you can notice that the other team doesn’t even have over 10 kills, meanwhile your team has 20 deaths because of bugs in the game that auto drain health (no I am not being shot by anyone because the other team is dead and respawning by this time, I run around many corners in hopes to get away but the bug just zaps my health.)  also the characters are HIGHLY unbalanced. The tank has high health which you have to unload two clips into him, but his weapon does so much damage that your only choice is to unload a clip, run and heal and hope that he’s a bot and hasn’t changed positions. Overall I don’t recommend this game in its current state and hopefully it improves somehow. The only reason I didn’t give it a one star is because it’s not a bad game, it just needs improvements. It’s like any other 5v5 fps, it just has too many bugs to Mark it as “fun.” First off I love the game it’s really good I see nothing wrong with the game I literally play this game everyday nice work. Now things that should be added to this game to make it better and more fun 1. Y’all should add crouching, jumping, and either slide or jetpack. This should be added so that in battle is easier to take cover and to get to a safe spot. 2. Having the ability to change characters in game. I wish that this was a thing because if your in battle and you wanna use a different character you can’t So please add that. 3. Add more modes. Now don’t get me wrong tdm and domination (zone capture) there fun but you should add different modes and events. 4. Friends list and multiplayer private rooms. Now this made me a little sad that y’all didn’t add these but please do cause there are many times when I wanna play my friends and can’t do it. 5. Gun camos. This is nothing major just a little something to spice the game up. Yea that’s about it all y’all need to do is add those things in and it will be good👍. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

‎Somme Trench,"You're a fresh British infantryman at the Battle of the Somme, one of the longest, bloodiest battles of World War One. Can you survive a clash that kills almost twenty thousand of your countrymen on the first morning alone? ""Somme Trench"" is an interactive historical novel by Andrew J. Schaefer, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Your best bet might be as an airplane gunner, or a trench fighter, or even as a stretcher bearer. Firing squads, brothels and homeward-bound steamships are all in your possible future.  Or you might give in to your inner demons and wind up chatting with ghosts and skeletons as though they're your friends. Whatever path you choose, you'll be immersed in a richly detailed, interactive historical novel that has almost as many twists and turns as there were soldiers at the Somme. • Immerse yourself in the world of the Western Front • Choose paths as diverse as infantryman, stretcher bearer or aircraft machine gunner • Learn about some of the most important events of world history • Challenge your mind • Enjoy a richly-detailed interactive novel with countless storylines • Solve mysteries embedded within the game",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/43/b0/87/43b08784-e891-3e54-3691-f757853e5529/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-0-4.png/1200x630wa.png,,5.0 • 24 Ratings,$2.99,,"June 28, 2018","I downloaded this game for the first time over a year ago.

I still remember my first play through. I love this game and no matter what I've always comeback to it at some point. It was very well made. Just to point out how much I like it this is the only game I'll ever write a review on. I can't stress how amazing it is without spoiling it. Anyways. Just. Get it it's. Amazing to say the least. No just the fighting and all that just. Get it. You won't be disappointed in the least. The one problem I have with this game is that I've been playing it for the past 7 hours straight. I've played through many times. I've died probably 10 times (mostly within the first 10 mins of fighting). It's a great game which actually has a lot of replay value. It's really interesting to see how each job you can have ties together and how a couple different choices can so greatly affect who lives and dies. Must have game right here! This is the first interactive fiction game that I played on mobile and almost certainly remains the best.It captures the tone of the war excellently and allows the player to take decisions that make for very different playthroughs.If you enjoy this, Divided We Fall, about the Spanish Civil War, makes for a strong follow-up.

But it’s not the best that I thought it would be that’s all I’m saying because all you do is tap and fly you should make it more interesting for people who are playing your games. You could start off with giving them characters like more bird characters to dress them while flying and you should make gender like male or female and they get to choose and maybe hairstyles or clothes but make it better. I’m just giving you guys hints not trying to be bossy at least for the next update at least be one of my ideas on there and if you do do that I will really appreciate it thank you for reading 😄. The reason why I didn’t put the other 3 stars is because this game and the modes are good but the problem is there not making these openings a lot more bigger for the bird to pass that’s why a lot of times people lose and like my friend she has this game and she always loses it’s just difficult and not right and it’s not interesting g like there’re should be a lot more things in this game it’s like horrible I can’t believe that’s this game is so boring like in the arcades flappy bird used to be fun now it’s boring like ugh it’s so bad I hope they make the openings more bigger and better and also why can’t we play online wit other people and do race wit other people like other games like so boring not interesting and u guys need to make the opening bigger thx😔😔😐🤬🤬🤬🤬😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😭😭😤😡😡😤🤬😡😭🤬😡😭😤🤬😡😤🤬😡🤬 ","Flappy Reborn - The Bird Game, AppTout, Games, Lifestyle, Adventure, Casual, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

Much more an old style turn based jrpg. However there are a lot of flaws.  Many bosses and monsters really create a frustrating experience making the game not fun overall.  Many bosses and monsters just spam negative effects or area of effect spells, and you spend most of your time reviving, healing and curing with any surviving characters.  You will blow through many dungeons just to find a boss obliterate you in 3 turns.   Even if you level up or change/ level up classes your hp are still very low and negative status effects hit at a very high rate. Often one charm spell charms my entire party.   Many boss battles I just got lucky, and I can't seem to get lucky on the last boss who often spams 4 area effect spells killing your entire party in one turn, even with the best eq and maxed skills/spells. There also isn't a skip button for conversations, since you will be fighting some bosses 10+ times hoping to get lucky and win, hearing the same conversation every time is tedious.Overall I like the genie concept, and style of game (although I will say you will be frustrated with how many levels have spike/lava floors! Seems the level designers love damage floors) however the balance of the bosses and how spells and effects hit makes the game very frustrating and not enjoyable. Touch Controls + Small Screen + Spikes = Does not work well together. This game is alright on iPad display but is kind of a nuisance on the iPhone. Game plot and gameplay is good like the others. I know these are old games being translated but if any more are being released I think the plot of ""empire"" needs to discontinue for a bit. There is too many currently revolving around the ""empire"".

The fact that if an enemy is close to dying they can pause and they become invincible. That needs to change now! It's so annoying because so many wusses pause so they can starve you out and win.

He’s figured out how to make a game where waging war on rotating cubes is, for all its intricacies, amazingly easy to get into. As bosses, teleporters, and other new wrinkles appear, the levels just get that much more fascinating—and incredibly fun to play. I love both the game itself and the visuals, which are in the neighborhood of Monument Valley’s minimalism without feeling like a wannabe.  It grows progressively more puzzling as unexpected twists in gameplay mechanics limit or altogether cancel out earlier, easier ways to kill the opponents.  This game makes me wrack my brain and look for patterns and think several moves ahead.  Still not all the way through it.  And when (if) I get to the end, a do-over awaits because the game judges and awards you if you can complete a given level in fewer moves and also tells you the fewest number of possible moves for each level.Oh and there’s a brain-bogglingly cool AR mode, in which you walk around the game instead of turning the game on the screen when your guy has been rotated to the opposite side.  Just bonkers.  I love it.  I’d give it 6 stars if I could.Also, there is a sequel called Euclidian Skies.  Just bought it today.  I hope it measures up to the very high standard the developers have set for themselves here.  Judging by the preponderance of 5 star reviews, I suspect it does. I actually enjoyed the game enough to give it a 5 plus. A little quirky using an iPhone, so my little guy didn’t always end up where I wanted.  I did navigate the game without one hint, walk-through or like, some parts were easy some not so. On the not so I would usually give it a rest, then tried again another day with better results.  One problem was being locked into one perspective on moves possible when you need to approach the puzzle a little differently.  Good example of that is the aligned bridge level.  If you’re good at 3-D space I’d give the game a try.  I have an iPhone seven and had no problems with it although it did eat through my battery life a little quicker than normal ","Euclidean Lands, kunabi brother GmbH, Games, Entertainment, Puzzle, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

‎Encounter Challenge Calc,"Determining what constitutes an appropriate challenge for your party of heroes can be a real chore.  This app handles all the math for you, including modifiers for creature count and number of characters, so you can spend more time planning your adventure. First, describe the character levels that comprise your party.  The app can handle any reasonable number of characters, at levels up to 20.  You could, for example, specify that your party is made up of three level-4 characters, one level-5 character, and one level-6 character.  Once your party is defined, the app will tell you the XP thresholds appropriate for challenges of easy, medium, hard, and deadly difficulties. Those thresholds become the basis for a couple of other features: Creature Count per CR, and Custom Encounter Difficulty. Creature Count per CR is essentially a quick-reference chart which shows you the maximum number of creatures of each Challenge Rating that you can throw at the party to generate encounters of various difficulty.  For example, suppose you want the 5-member party described above to have a Hard encounter with some Challenge 2 creatures, such as ogres.  The chart will tell you that you'll need to use 4 of those creatures. Custom Encounter Difficulty is a calculator that allows you to define an encounter that consists of multiple, mixed CR creatures, and then tells you the difficulty of that encounter.  To illustrate, consider again our 5-member example party.  Using the Custom Encounter Difficulty calculator, you can create an encounter consisting of one CR1, two CR2, and one CR3 creatures, and it will tell you that this constitutes a hard encounter worth 3,600 XP.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/03/c3/a0/03c3a0c3-c1e0-4a77-e54a-97b2ecc9733f/pr_source.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.0 • 2 Ratings,$0.99,,"August 1, 2015","Not bad, much easier than doing it manually.

Core to Stellar Horizon is that its virtual galaxy, including the stars and planets, are all created through random procedural generation using deterministic algorithms. A single seed number is used to create these features via mathematical computation thus eliminating the need to create each of these features by hand. This enables the game to have a massively open nature: it is estimated that with the 32-bit seed number, Stellar Horizon virtual galaxy will include over 4 billion planets. Any player will be able to visit a specific planet once they know its galactic coordinates, given their spacecraft has the capability to do so, and find the same features as any other player, as these coordinates serve as the seed for the planet's topography and environment.",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/de/2f/ac/de2fac4a-6a8d-7d39-bfe5-11b021f24729/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-6-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png,explore the infinite space,3.8 • 49 Ratings,$2.99,,"March 26, 2020","*Updated review below*I'm having quite a bit of fun playing this. It's a solid space exploration/sandbox game. It has solid yet basic exploration, combat and trading gameplay. I am looking forward to seeing where this can go. I am surprisingly impressed with the implementation of the planetary landing and exploration. The gameplay is basic but surprisingly engaging. My only major criticisms are the difficulty of selecting stars (the star map doesn't help) and a lack of content, but the latter is understandable given the life of this project. Thanks!Update: Ive jumped back into this game since I first reviewed this game a year ago, and the author has added a bunch of features. Planets now have flaura/fauna and explorable bunkers. Ships feature power management now. There are some graphical tweaks as well. This game is still fun and I forward to even more features to expand exploration, trading and fights! I really wish more games in the app store had the feeling of exploration that this one does.  My dream features would be:-Smooth/real-time exploration of planet surfaces -Selectable planets in navigation map -More things to interact with in space (minable asteroids, discoverable things in solar systems, etc) This is the only game on an iPhone that can match other games like elite dangerous so well. Most other games are over the top shoot em ups, but this game is so much more. With a whole economy and guild system it gets really in depth. Depending on the player this can be a good or bad thing. It will be a lot harder to learn and master but when you do, it can give so much content in return. It feels like every day I find something new that I had no idea was in the game such as wormholes, dinosaurs/life, monoliths, and so much more so when u find them it feels like you are progressing. Overall this is a great game that is tough around the edges but if u can get over the graphical quality, controls, and the depth and complexity of the game and want a game to relax to and play any way you want, this is the best to get.This game is great if you are an avid player of games like elite dangerous and no mans sky. This is the game I’ve been looking for! I purchased and started playing (on IPad mostly) just a few days ago and I’m really enjoying this game. It’s more in the lines of space exploration, which is what I’ve been looking for. It’s also nice to play a game that you don’t get targeted all the time and get a chance just to enjoy exploring. This game has many bells, whistles, and choices and I found it relatively easy to play. I’m not the greatest at battling attackers when it happens but the nice thing is the developer doesn’t make you start all over from scratch. Also nice to pay one price and play! Nicely done and looking forward to continuing play and future updates.

I managed to (somehow) get about 700 trophies on this game, but it would be a lot easier if the other players you fight weren't all bots. The only way you can play with teammates that aren’t bots is if you manage to gather friends, but even then you’re always fighting against bots that usually don’t do anything.  Obviously taking a lot of inspiration from Supercell’s Brawl Stars, an app that I can gladly say is my favorite mobile game, Super Cats could have some great potential if it decided to separate itself from blatantly trying to be like other apps or famous characters, and try to implement a unique idea into their game. My favorite game is brawl stars so if a game copy it they should make it better and not horible. And it copys all the characteristics of the brawlers in brawl stars and 2 or 3 days happened to me that when I left the game and then enter again all my progress is not there. And to if you want to have the idea of an other game do not do all the same you need to do it better and have your own ideas and not copy all of the game. But I said this to MOBA games they need to improve in this because it copy almost all of brawl stars. And sorry if this get you mad but is the true so improve in this game because people will begin to annoy you with the very bad comments. So DO NOT COPY BRAWL STARS WELL YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF BRAWL STARS TO DO A GAME BUT DO NOT COPY ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BRAWL STARS please and am not saying at all that this game is ALL bad. And do not get mad with me please Like brawl stars but a bit different. I love the battle royale and would play it any day of the week over brawl stars showdown but thats about it all the only thing different about the characters in this game compared to brawl stars is the designs they function the exact same and also one map?

It is the best of both worlds!!!This is a great game. It starts just like a very old school hard core dungeon crawler that is hard as hell with a lot of character maintenance. If you are young then you may have never even seen a game like this. DON’T GIVE UP! as you progress the maintenance goes away and the game allows for a nice long run without you having to keep starting over. Items collected will grant you the ability to continue after death, Lamp post will grant you the ability to save. p.s.This company crown jewel is “Tower of fortune 3”. One of the all time best turn based rpgs on iOS. It has literally hundreds of hours of gameplay and yet costs less than a cup of coffee.  Do yourself a favor and check it out :)REQUEST: please allow upgrade to treasures during the adventure. I have been playing this game nonstop thus I never went back to the main menu. I made it all the way to the queens gallery before even knowing you could upgrade treasures. hope this feedback helps :) Always great games by these guys.I’m always torn whenever I see another new game pop up though. Half wishing they were able to just pour all their efforts into a single crazy game but half realizing they’ve found a good comfortable niche for themselves.Just think, Tower of Fortune 4 and it’s bigger than every other game combined.One can dream and that’s why I’ll keepBuying these games I made it to an out of the way save point on the second floor and ran out of torches. Now, it’s straight up impossible for me to do anything because I can’t see.  Fine it’s my own fault.  But I have 4 lives remaining.  So, I’m forced to kill my self 4 times if I want to end my run.  I don’t even have the option to delete the run or start a new one.  I’m just stuck with having to suicide 4 times if I want to start a new game.  How was this overlooked??  If the devs fixed the issues, I would rate the game better.  For now, I would say don’t bother.  Not sure if I want to keep playing if I can’t even start a new game easily.

Still, I got through the first pass  and hoped that would be it, looking forward to getting back to the frame game. But you have to keep playing it at various stages. While you can skip some of the sequences, there are others involving timed movement which are just impossible. I gave up at the ""swimming past rocks"" sequence. I tried repeatedly, asked my partner (who is a skilled RPG player and has great reflexes), and we both gave up after about 30 minutes. Maybe it's because it's a port to iOS but these fast-reflex challenges seem literally unplayable on iPad. Please consider allowing players to skip GWIG completely! Or make the challenges non-time-dependent. GWIG can be a fine concept, but if not executed well, it shuts the whole gameplay down, and I've had to simply give up. Main part of the game is fun, the fantasy mini game would've been fun if the controls were easier to handle. I was stuck at the part where you need to swim through the moat, and because the controls aren't very responsive, I kept bumping into the rocks. Should've used the d-pad from one of the previous escape sequences or been given the option to skip the part entirely. I just gave up and uninstalled the game, since it seems I'm not able to finish it without completing the mini game. Would've been fun to play otherwise, I'm sure. Very difficult to solve some of these scenes, and I'm a pretty seasoned adventure gamer. It would be nice if there were : 1) hints 2)instructions for ALL mini games (including 'snake' - horrible game that didn't make sense)3) less dialogue Not a fan of the 8bit game in game, plus it was too hard to figure out at times- glad there were some skips on that. I also found myself googling the walk through most of the game. If it wasn't for that I would've given up.     Storyline is good, twist good,but I agree with a previous review that keeping track of characters was confusing, not to mention I didn't development an emotional attachment to them- probably bc during the dialogue there is only a still pic of them while dialogue is typed out;  so when the twist came, I was like, Oh.....K....? (but there was another little twist at the very end {the girl} which I liked)All that said, I still gave it 4 stars bc graphics were great, liked the story, the effort and teamwork to make these games is something to applaud, and I would like to see more games in the future 😊Thank you dev's!!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 ","The Lost Chapter, Squadventure, Games, Adventure, Entertainment, Puzzle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

It really should have more people playing it! I already played it before and I’m getting into it again because I have enough storage for it (I’m running low on storage at the moment so even smaller apps are hard to get right now). Basically this game is a type of tapping game, I really love it! The overall storyline is super cute and its fun to play and if your on a road trip, airplane flight etc. it is a great game to play! I am incredibly surprised that it’s not super popular right now! I like how also the types of creatures you fight aren’t always easy and that the game is actually challenging! Thanks so much for making this app! I really love it! Will definitely continue to play it as time passes bye :3! Keep up the good work! I’m going to probably add on to this review seeing that I have only been playing again for a little while because as I said I downloaded it again! :3 Love! ❤️The art style, the fish, and collectible skins are all so very cute and the story/ game play is enjoyable as well.  I’ve been using this game as a productivity app; since it needs to be running for you to fish and offers an auto/ black screen mode, I have found myself trying to use my phone less and getting more work done ever since playing it😂 There are regular monthly events on repeat but I look forward to new events in the future. In any case, I only high praises for this game; I love it so much!! Don’t get me wrong I really love this game, but when you want to ride your boats to places it’s really frustrating. I wish that you could just simply click one button and then you would be teleported there. Now I understand that some people like to fish at that time, but I usually don’t. So if you would be so kind to have the OPTION to teleport there that would be fantastic! Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day! Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

I’ve read complaints here that it was too short but I played almost two days, ot sure how many more there were to go, but at the amusement park the last item to find was outside the realm of the picture.  I would wait for the clue to recharge and each time it went further and further into the darkness.  I gave it a high rating because I’ve been playing these hops about a month now and of all the developers this was the cheapest and didn’t start looping or breaking about half an hour in and there’s no way to get your money back.  Some I really like you cannot buy, everything is in-game purchase and can end up costing a lot more than a few bucks to play if you want to continue for awhile which I sgurely would do.  That’s the problem, it’s either free with ads, simple pay a couple bucks to rid ads, very interesting but everything costs, or like this one good price got a couple days entertainment. When I played the game it was fun and interesting. Some small issues like some objects were impossible to find because they blended into the background too much, even adjusting the brightness didn't help. Finished the whole game in 2 hours. For the price, it should have been 3 or 4 times the length as others in this genre are, so its very hard to justify the price with so many other games out there for this price at an appropriate length.  Unicorrn castle would be a more worthy buy. The cost for this game was way overpriced!  I finished in less than 52 minutes.  It was, at the most, $1.99 worth of fun.  Hardly challenging except for trying to figure out some of their translations into English and trying to see into the dimly lit scenes (even with my brightness to the max).

While I enjoy both of the concepts and definitely the art and story telling of both games, I find it a little challenging to think about playing the games without purchases. While they both didn’t require to have money spent on them, I bought gems and such for DangerousFellows and Maxed the energy levels on MayDay Memories. I love both of the games and their different mechanics, but I think it would have been increasingly difficult for me to play the game without spending money. As it’s known, you can watch adds for energy refills and purchase them with gems, but I believe that the energy costs later in the stories are expensive and it would take a normal player that hasn’t spent money on the game at least 2-3 days to complete one episode. Other than that, I love the story in both of these games, and am very impressed with the story of Mayday Memories. I wished that there could have been a “happier” ending in the normal route, but aside from that, I think this game is great! So good work to the LucyDream group for creating such a great game and story!!!! Hello, this is Lucydream.Thank you for your review! We listen to and consider all your feedback when creating future games and content. Try going for one of the special endings, as one of them might be more to your liking! ;) I really lime the game. I like the protagonist and I really anticipate her having her own name since there's usually a little cognitive dissonance for me with these type games. (For example, if I'm playing as myself then it's a little weird if the choices I'm given don't line up with my actual reactions but since this a different character I'm all for it!) I really like the characters and pretty much everything about it. However I don't like how the game makes you spend more energy the deeper you go into the story. A lot of the extra stuff takes some time to get to if you're like me and can't or don't want to pay for much. Aside from the small stuff I fully recommend the game!Edit: OK, the fact that I have to spend more energy the more chapters I read is really getting on my nerves! What is the point to it?! All it does is slow the reader down and drafts everything out. Ten energy points was fine, fifteen was OK (I wasn't happy about it but I could live), but now the chapters take up around 30 energy points and that means there isn't enough left it do much in the actual story! SERIOUSLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE CHAPTERS SO PRICY MAKE THE ENERGY FILL UP HIGHER THE FARTHER YOU GO, FIND WEBSITES WHICH GIVE YOU ENERGY POINTS AND DON'T GIVE UNGODLY NUMBERS OF QUESTIONS JUST TO GET EVEN A CHANCE AT GETTING ENERGY, OR JUST MAKE ALL THE CHAPTERS THE SAME PRICE!!! I have not encountered such great galgame for a while. Although I still do not think the main storyline is an A(In my heart it is a B+), but man, the romance development writing tho!!! I have not encountered such a good writing in galgame in years! No sexy selling elements,  no cg selling, just pure logical, heartwarming conversations. They are truly great and natural, which is so rare in galgame. So natural and still here and there, something will make u sense the flirtation which is so kind and flirty at the same time. The writers are very good at developing relationship and reveal characters. I truly appreciate this story and the effort putting into writing it.(PS: thank u for the existence of Hansol. He is perfect in every way. Thank you for creating him. The humor, wow. Pls make sure the ppl working to make him and others read this comment and know that the effort was appreciated and I don’t usually speak so high of a romance game characters) ","Mayday Memory: CHOICE SF Otome, Storytaco.inc, Games, Adventure, Simulation, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"
‎Paradigm City,"The Golden Age of heroes is over, but you're just beginning. Will you use your powers to help the world or help yourself? Set on a near-future Earth that has been irrevocably altered by the arrival of superhumans, the world has been dealing with a radical shift in the nature of humanity. For thirty years, those with world-altering powers - referred to as capes - have been at the forefront of the world's media. There has been heroes, there has been villains, and there has been world-shattering confrontations when those two groups came into contact. For a time, those individuals walked the world like modern deities. For a time, it was good. But things change. Given time, all things resolve to entropy. The Golden Age is over.

If you make a certain choice that ends in you battling the Maekir unit, and decide to ""take down"" Jotun and arrest them all, the story hiccups to the option where you kill Jotun after some writing that makes no sense both order and option wise. Would really appreciate a fix, thank youEdit: soon after writing this, after having killed Jotun unwillingly, I chose the option to troubleshoot Anima and the writing makes it sound as if she killed Jotun instead, probably something that happens if you make different choices? Anyways, just another problem, thanks. With the quality of latest hosted games I didn't have much hope for this one but it surprised me. It was well written and the story was pretty good. I actually enjoyed it very much. Doesn't have a very high replay value however it is lengthy and well executed. Worth every penny.

D. D. It's a lot of fun being that you progress so quickly and always level up so you feel good at the game even when you're new and when the game does get tough you just Prestige then your power more powerful than before. There is A lot of content for such a simple game even if you live a busy life style your character continues to play even when you're not actively playing.  I recommend you try it out.  I guarantee you will love it. I've played for over a year and still continue to move up and put up a good contest in tournaments. Plus it's free and the in game purchases don't make you that strong so they're not necessary. So may the BEST man win not the RICHEST. I really want to love this game, and do love many aspects of it, but even after numerous communications to the developers (with only limited and extraordinarily slow response in return) I remain immensely frustrated by the effect of hacker/cheaters in tournaments, and especially the extremely obvious ones in the Heroes Tournaments!Better rule enforcement is needed to prevent individuals from exceeding the limits of normal gameplay to rise to the top of the tournament roster with end-game levels within the first hour or two of the tournament, and clearly with several times the scores of the best normal players below them. I have screenshots from numerous tournaments that clearly demonstrate that this is happening, and continue to forward them to the developers, but without any apparent concern on their part to update Tap Titans against the hacks, now that Tap Titans 2 is out. It is totally unfair to all the players who are trying to play the original game fairly!Unfair play aside, this game has many worthy attributes, and would otherwise be worthy of a top rating. Developers, please fix the hacker problem, for as long as this shameful situation continues, it stands as a black mark against your prowess as programmers, and lowers our interest in any of Game Hives's other offerings! It's a pretty good time waster. It's fun pushing the limit to see how far you can get before you prestige. Each time you prestige, you get X amount of relics. The amount of relics you earn is based off of your characters level, your group level, and the stage in the game you reach. You use the relics to buy artifacts which give you a variety of bonuses such as additional damage, or more dropped gold while playing. It's a pretty fun game, but can get boring. When it gets boring for me, I just let my characters grind for me offline, and when I open the game again, level them up, advance to a stage proportionate to my team's strength, and close the game. So either way you want to play, I think it's fun. I did buy the lowest possible amount of diamonds to get rid of the ads, so it makes the game a little more bearable. One final bit, I would not recommend spending diamonds on anything except buying things for your character, and there's no need to actually spend cash for diamonds. You get plenty of free ones in game through drops, events, ads, and weekly login awards.

It also has the bonus scare factor. No glitches, runs smoothly with easy menu options. I enjoyed looking for the bonus paintings and such.  The puzzles given were also well done offering variety and a decent challengeThe Bad: My problem is more with the everyday object finding (all the little things you need to get to open a door, a journal or a cupboard).  It was a constant back and forth motion that got so tedious.  For example, you would need a flower shaped object for a drawer. In the next room, you find it and then return to the drawer to open it. That drawer had another object for a drawer somewhere else. You go there and that one had a piece for the original room.  Basically you went in circles. I would find a leaf for example, forget where it went and have to use the Hint button to remember.  Then again I would use it only to find an object needed for the room I was just in.  Also the Finding Object areas were not very challenging.  In fact they were too easy (they were in plain sight and never hidden very well).In the end, I didn't hate the game but it was definitely not a favorite. Greetings, Gamers: 👄A big sweeping bow and curtsy to the fine devs @ Elephant. What an excellent job they've done with this game: haunting atmospherics, good storyline, great graphics and music and scariness to boot!I actually got the heebie-jeebies hearing the moaning cries for help and knocking coming from nowhere...and everywhere!Puzzles were interesting and varied as were the HOS. Collectibles were fun to keep an eye out for (when I wasn't looking over my shoulder!)Glitch-free, this game had incredible fluidity unlike anything else I've experienced here lately. Transport map was smooth and efficient. A wonderful wink of the eye and nice touch: the orphan photos are actually baby pics of the game devs as tykes. It was fun reading their English/Anglo names then flipping them over to read their names in their native language and job title. Quite clever!The secret room is a nice bonus. Going back in now to beat my original time.Want some spooky fun, thrills and chills? Give this game a go and enjoy an early Halloween treat.

Purchased the headset that the game came with. I was very excited to play and once I set everything up, I was disappointed. The controls are bad, the remote itself feels as if it will fall apart when pressing buttons, AND the actions in the game are delayed by at least 3-4 seconds. Can’t say I was very pleased with this experience... This game lags a lot. The remote fails to connect most of the time. The earbuds ALSO don’t work. I’m returning the entire thing tomorrow. I am happy I saved the receipt for this... For those who posted that they cannot get above level 4 it is because this is only  an entry game to let you see how it looks like.

It is a standard left to right action game with similarities / flavors of older titles such as Ghost House for the Sega Master System or Phantom Fighter for the NES. It involves moving from 1 starting location to the exit (Usually a door) to complete SED level. At which point you proceed to the next level. Action is carried out by shooting your enemies with a hand gun.Graphics:Since this is a port of an older J2me title it has that 16bit visual feel all over it. (one of the reasons I was sucked in to buy it) The graphics do the job of giving you that Splaterhouse or Ghost House feel but only lightly and do not make use of any parallax or multilayer scrolling that is usually found in almost all true older 16bit games of this type during the late 80's and early 90's. Frames of Animation are decent for what there is and horribly lacking for what there isn't. Your walking animations and gun firing animations are cute enough but there is absolutely NO jumping animation! Your character just begins to hover up and to the right or left, and then land. What...??? Even your enemies display a decent amount of frames when provoked or die, so why the lazy programming. (we will get to that later).Sound:I was actually surprised in this department! There seems to be 2 short eerie tunes that switch each level and last about 10 to 15 seconds in length before repeating. Not bad if you consider that this is an older J2me port. Most didn't have any music let alone sound effects unless it was from a major company like Gameloft or EA. Even the sound effects shocked me considering the source material. They had well sampled gun fire and death sound for the enemies and weapons.Control:This is where it all begins to fall apart and show how much effort (or lack there of) was put into this Iphone port. In the move from the J2me format where only 1 button press could be recognized at a time to the Iphone, nothing was changed! You still can only use one action button or movement button at a time. We are still in 2009 right? We didn't all take a step to the left and go through the time warp again did we? This to me along with the lack of animation and cut and paste jumping that reeks of early cell phone games in NO way justifies the $1.99 they are asking.Conclusion:I was sucked in by the decent 16bit ish looking art and theme. DO NOT GET SUCKED IN AS WELL BY THIS TRAP! This is a very BARE bones direct port of a really old J2me cell phone game that takes absolutely no advantage of the Iphone's capabilities! That coupled with a $1.99 asking price is pure madness in this APP market. If there was a .50 app selection I would still not recommend it. Another example of a company suckering the good people on the APP store out of their hard earned money! Contrary to what has been written, I like it. I LOVE the spooky music!!! It's cool adds a really nice touch!! It's playable. It's a platform game, I'm biased to platform games, there's not enough here in the app store, and the graphics could be better, but it's pretty fun.

Great art, great characters, love that you can occasionally choose what answers the characters give. My biggest issue is that bathroom and shower brakes.  They barely give energy as is....why make it harder to keep them. It’s almost pointless to have them. Also, we should be able to use whatever amount of energy we have left to go towards tress, rocks, etc, to help knock down the cost. So if a tree is 114 but your top limit is 72, you should be able to use all 72 toward that tree so you can go back later maybe finish knocking it out. It seems like it’s awful difficult to accumulate the amount needed. Granted I’m currently only level 13, so maybe once you get a little higher it’ll be slightly easier???? Also the current holiday love island and bird island seem almost impossible to get through unless you’re paying for gems to get dynamite. I had to stop wasting my energy on those cause I’m not really getting anywhere. I understand you need to make money too but it shouldn’t be impossible. Throw an occasional ad for energy or something to help. Thank you very much for your review concerning our game. We are always collecting user feedback and emails that we can apply with updates. We've forwarded your feedback to our developers. Thank you for taking out the time to send us your suggestions! Update: After almost completing the treasure island and making and finding the time pieces my fountain still won’t update! Pease help. When I started this game it was so exciting and fun. I stayed up till 5 in the morning unable to put it down and it quickly became my favorite game. I deleted most of my other games and just played this one. Today I am very frustrated with it. Usually when a new island opens you will get a lot of items that give energy and play for a long time. Since the start of the new treasure island yesterday I haven’t been able to move anywhere. As soon as I get energy it’s gone with one item and I have to wait several hours just to spend less than 2 minutes of play. I’m so upset. I’m an older disabled person and this is my escape. I finished the last treasure island way ahead of time. I found all the time pieces and cleaned the island. Still my fountain never updated! This new mission looks like I’ll never get it finished and finding the pieces are almost impossible do to the lack of energy. Even the videos you can watch to earn rubies has become limited. After two videos it says I have to wait 8 hrs before I can open those trunks or collect rubies on the shore. Why did it change?  I hope you can fix this. I really wanted to give you 5 stars but I’m just so aggravated! Thank you. We are very sorry to hear that you have encountered such inconvenience. Please follow the link below and find the «Contact Us» section. We hope to help you as soon as possible. https://melsoft-games.helpshift.com/a/family-island/ I was having a great time with this game until the Christmas event. First it came in early and completely broken and I was wondering if it was even fixable but really the game just needed to update. It updated and got fixed and my event progress got reset as expected. Then i played through the event a second time and got quite far into star island before it got reset...again. Apparently there were more bugs that needed to be fixed so progress needed to be reset and thankfully the time got reset too. But the second play through i bought the smallest gem pack and collected some gems that i specifically used to buy energy so I could get stuff done quickly and progress in the Christmas event. Now i received 300 gems for my progress getting reset and was told that I would get my gems i spent also in the event time refunded back to me so id be officially at square one with compensation for having to do it again. But i never received my extra gems. I went to support and they repeated you got your gems in every way possible without actually helping me with the situation. I paid money but they really didn’t care about giving me compensation for that money that i paid which turned me off of the game almost immediately after. I really liked the game but I dont want to play it anymore because if I encounter a problem that only affects me directly I know I wont get the needed support.

So when I found this game, I thought it would be fun to try out, especially since it had been made accessible with VoiceOver. Three days later and I've been totally sucked in! I have no idea how to use the soulwells. Can I choose what is made from them, or do they just randomly create whatever I may need at any given time? Nevertheless, I have been enjoying myself and this sure beats worrying about the dreaded COVID-19. If there was a way to support the game (I already bought the Gold version right after downloading this even before knowing anything about what it offered), I would do so. Perhaps there could be a tip jar to support this project and its continued expansion. I'm glad I am not compelled to keep spending money, but I would like to throw in some clams from time to time to express my gratitude, both for making this accessible and for keeping me hooked with all the different monsters. Absurd underlings has been my favorite so far. Thank you again for an idle adventure that has kept me coming back for more. It’s super addicting and fun to play! I have some suggestions though for new features. 1)Allow players to buy upgrades to speed up building new buildings. There’s instructors to speed up training your army but not anything to speed up constructing buildings. 2)Allow for an option to place shamans on two aspects of soul wells, or be able to choose how many shamans on each, such as 3 on fruiting and 4 on growing for example. 3)An option to direct attacks on certain character types or on strength. Kinda like bloons tower defense, let us pick where our damage wants to go on an opposing army such as on the strongest troops first or on a specific class like healers. If these features were added to the game, it would be 100% my favorite game this year, and without them it still is a fantastic game! I almost never write reviews, but this game definitely deserves. There are a few minor bugs and thing here and there, but all in all it is very fun. I noticed when the Kobold’s come in to the story, they say they will levy 30% of food, but they actually take much less. Also, it would be cleaner if without the decimal points in the 1/10’s place. I’m a long time incrementalist, and this hails strongly to “A Dark Room” with a few key changes. Also a note to the developer, please decrease the number of resources requires to build later stage houses, at a certain point they become very difficult to obtain.

First of all, I would have given this game 5 stars without a second thought if not for an awful bug at the end of chapter 3. I cannot proceed past chapter 3 into chapter 4, whenever I press the continue button and try to, the game crashes. I have also tried clicking the chapters button and accessing it from there. The same thing happens, the entire game crashes. I really want to finish this game because it is so well made, unique, and compelling. So, I urge the developers etc. to please fix this bug as soon as possible. As well as another one I encountered in chapter 3. So, in chapter 3 Boris is supposed to open the door to Alice Angel. However, he got stuck and wouldn’t move at an open door a few feet away from the one he was supposed to fix. By using the elevator and going to random floors and coming back, I was able to fix it. But it was still very annoying so please fix that too. Otherwise, the game is great and would 10/10 recommend. Ok so first great game I beat all five chapters in like 2 hours I have been hoping that bendy would come to iPhone I have been watching markiplier and jacksepticeye play it Ever sense it was released back in 2017 and been a fan of it ever since also I loved that you put in your little meatly cameos and that jacksepticeye and DAgames had cameos to! But now on to the bug so when I played the game again I was in chapter three and I got the tommy gun and listened to Henry’s secret audio log and and I got to the end the elevator wouldn’t move and now I have to restart my game so if you can fix that that would be great well in the words of Wally franks I’m out of here! Ok so I know I mentioned the elevator a couple months ago and this is kinda a stupid question but I was wondering if you could make a setting in chapters 1 2 and 3 Ware we could switch it to the old chapters back to the remastered chapters I know you guys are working bendy and the dark revival but if you guys could do that that would be awesome sorry to bug you also are you guys making bendy and the dark revival for the switch play station Xbox and phone like this one? Sorry got excited when the trailer came out I love Bendy. Having been a fan since chapter 1 first came out, I was delighted to see a mobile version now that the game has been completed. However, there seems to be a bug in chapter 3. I’ve tried to play it multiple times, but because the level is so big, I don’t have the time to complete it in one sitting. This is no problem in chapters 1 and 2, since I can save and exit the level/game. However, this doesn’t work in chapter 3. I exit the game fine, but when I try to play it from where I left off, I end up stuck in the elevator with none of the buttons working and the doors closed. When I look at the objective, it says to take the pipe, plunger, etc. But I’m already holding the item. I end up having to start a new game completely, and after three or four times of this, it gets very tiring. I love everything else about Bendy, and since these kind of bugs happen to even the best developers, I’ve still decided to give the game 5 stars anyway. (though I would still love it if you fixed this bug) ","Bendy and the Ink Machine, Joey Drew Studios Inc., Games, Action, Adventure, Entertainment, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"
‎Summer of Memories,"We all grow up someday. Time passes, the world changes, and we change with it. And so we present to you a tribute, to the summers of our youth. --------------------------- Overview --------------------------- Summer of Memories is a casual, easy-to-play narrative game set in Japan in the late Showa era. Just pick a few items for our protagonist Sosuke to put in his backpack for the day, and off he'll go to explore. When he returns, he'll regale you with tales of his adventures. From bug-hunting to beaches to friends to family—many stories both sad and sweet await you. So put on that swimsuit, collect everything under the sun, and come share an unforgettable summer with Sosuke and a wide cast of characters! Oh, and of course, this game is free to play from start to finish! --------------------------- Story --------------------------- Ah, summer break, and those lazy days of carefree fun in the sun! A time for adventure, yes, and a time to forge unforgettable memories, too. This is the tale of one boy's summer on a small rural island near Shikoku. It is a story of surprising encounters and melancholy goodbyes. A humble chronicle, yet even the most ordinary of things can live on in our hearts forever. =============== English Localization Lead / PM: Gavin Greene English Translation: npckc Matt Erik Katch Gavin Greene ===============",https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/4b/50/f1/4b50f1c2-6558-80a2-b72a-ed56519ea9f4/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.9 • 196 Ratings,Free,,"September 30, 2020","This was such an amazing game. It was very cute, very relaxing, but also very riling. The game play was really nice. I thought the fact that Sosuke chose when he wanted to leave was nice. That way it didn’t really feel like an obligation, but that he/you really wanted to explore these places. I use he/you that way, because this game REALLY DOES make you invested in it and like want to go to these different places. See what they’re like. Plus the storyline. Ugh, don’t even get me started. It was so- Cool! That’s the only other way I can put it. I personally, was hoping that Sosuke would decide to stay on the island where he’s happy, but he does need to be with his mother. I feel like I also learned things that he learned with him. He really learned to understand her better and I think that was a really nice idea for it. I genuinely cried at the end, though. Seriously developers. I was in search of a nice game that I wouldn’t get tired of. And that was this. Though it was short, it brightened my day every time!!! So 1) Thank you and 2) Great job. This was perfect in my eyes. <3 Having played the other games of this developer, I must say this is their best work yet. They clearly put a lot of love and effort into their games. The games are not much in gameplay and are almost all about the story (much like a visual novel game), which I throughly appreciate. This one in particular is very relatable and hits so close to home! I highly recommend for anyone and everyone to play this game. You won’t regret all those peaceful minutes you spend in the beautiful world. It has some sad moments, some happy ones, and some funny ones too! Everything you need for an emotional adventure is right here in this little game. Please feel free to pick it up and support the amazing developers! This game is a true stress reliever- it’s simple to play with an engaging story that doesn’t force you or manipulate you into buying anything to actually play. There is a power up that makes the game completely effortless to play and there are occasional ads that give you rewards, but they’re inconsequential and not really needed unless you’re trying to speed through the game. I finished this game in about a week, maybe less, and I honestly wish it were a bit longer only because I was having so much fun. 100% recommend this game, along with the developers earlier titles such as the Showa Candy Shop series.

I added one more star for finally fixing what was broken, withholding a star because this game is clearly not getting love from the localizers. -------------------------------This is a great game, but unfortunately an incomplete product. There are 2 bugs I've encountered: one where none of the St. Maryanne's Academy name tags are recorded, and the other is that the game crashes in EX Chapter 5.

It moved me enough to buy and play the game on my phone, and I find myself liking it as much as I like the Witcher 3 or Fallout 4. These games are absolutely not similar though. I really enjoy the story. I can't say why ""spoilers"" voice acting, though be it in Japanese, is great. As you read along with the voice, it feels like the actor speaks English, definitely recommend This is basically the exact same game as the PSP Version, but a few things... bother me. One: the typeface is set to either Arial or Times New Roman, one of the two. It doesn’t really look good at all. Two: The game is seemingly locked at like, 300 FPS. Everything is way too fast, to the point where the Wrong End screen gets cut off VERY fast. Otherwise, it’s the same game with relatively few changes. ","Corpse Party, MAGES.

‎Ember,"About Ember “Back in the earliest days, there was no sun and the world was dark. The heavens opened up and stars fell like beacons into the pitch black world, and they were known as “Embers”. Powerful and wise druids of a primordial race, “the Lightbringers,"" roamed the orb searching for this luminous matter. They performed a ritual of awakening to call the “Embers” out of their deep sleep. Suddenly the world became bright, and the veil of darkness was lifted. The Embers were the embodiment of magical flame, light, and life, but as word spread about the sheer power of the Embers, they came to be hunted and captured…and so the War for Ember began…”  From the tome “Restoration of the Lightbringer”  Gameplay overview A passion project 10 years in the making, Ember is a homage to classic role-playing games. Ember features a deep branching story, endless exploration across dynamic and living environments, a robust skill tree, and an intricate crafting system. In Ember, players are resurrected as a “Lightbringer” and summoned to protect the dying Embers as the world is on the brink of collapse. Beginning in the Deep Barrows, players traverse vast environments divided between aboveground and underground realms – ranging from lush forests to dry deserts and dark abysses – to reach the City of Light. The story unfolds through encounters with strangers, and players are forced to decide their destiny by making pivotal decisions.  Key features 	Classic-style, role-playing game with 30+ hours of epic adventure  	Epic storytelling filled with fascinating characters, lore, adventure, and humor  	Over 70 quests with diverse gameplay enabling players to choose their path  	Engaging party-based real-time combat system with tactical pause  	Over 65 combat skills for the player to use in customized battle party strategy  	Encounter hundreds of NPCs with their own tales to tell  	In-depth crafting system, from baking bread to forging magic weapons  	More than 20 handcrafted environments and shadowy dungeons  	Meet different companions with their own backstory quests  	Experience dynamic weather and time of day system",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/0e/39/6b/0e396b2d-426b-759c-7074-5b35590ef81f/mzl.worrbikw.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.1 • 180 Ratings,$9.99,#82 in Role Playing,"December 20, 2016","To start I must give kudos to developers who poured their hearts into this passion project. As a gamer I can immerse myself into their world and feel the meticulous details. Great character design, landscape, music, voice recording, and effects. Thank you for a wonderful game. Now comes the ""BUT"", and this bit of irate is magnified by the perfection in every other aspect so far I have experienced. The blemish lies in the dialogues and literature of the world. If only the developers hired writers with higher proficiencies the game would be complete. The writing style is of a modern teenager's attempt being a bard or historian which breaks the immersion. And the protagonist sounds less like a legendary warrior and more of a pleading child. I only point it out because this would otherwise have been a standard bearer for iOS isometric RPGs. Hope to see more from developers in the future, and a writing quality on par with Baldur's Gate. The good: Nice graphics with bright colors and buildings that pop out at you. Basic crafting system, not overly complicated. Plenty of quests. Open world.The bad: Would be much better on an iPad, the buttons are so tiny that they’re hard to hit. Combat feels over simple without many strategic elements. Text trees almost all seem to lead to the same result, regardless of what’s said. Overt political bias of developers in storyline. Minimal differences in three character classes. The status and menu bars block the screen enough to significantly detract from the pretty graphics. The characters look small as little ants, if you zoom in, it remains fixed on your main character so it’s tough to zoom in and just focus on things unless he’s near them. The main character seems empty, hollow, unrelatable, boring, even in his picture. I did win the game, but never felt a huge amount of satisfaction. It would have been better with a little bit more freedom to change the outcome of quests, more text trees with varying outcomes, more strategy in combat, more variety of the classes, and an interface that better suited iPhones without teeny buttons. Just to name a few things. Probably an option for less experienced RPG fans who are looking for a simpler experience and have an iPad. This game is great and worth the price. My only complaint is, as playing as an iPhone player, the controls can be frustrating. My complaints are only with movement. I click on an enemy to attack but the character will move next to the enemy and not attack. Or I will want to move and click on an object instead. Other than that this game is quite addicting and well worth playing if you like challenging rpg's. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

JUST SELL THE IDEA OR SOMETHING. Also I have 50,000 purple  diamond things and nothing to spend them on because everything’s maxed out so why am I even playing anymore. PLEASE CHANGE THE YOU FAILED COMMENT. If that doesn’t change soon I will delete the appOkay I loved the app but I deleted it because there’s an app about every 15-20 seconds and every time you messed up, it would say in big capital letters YOU FAILED! Which is a very sad attempt to get people to play more. It’s really awful and I’m bringing it up to everyone who has the app. Also I think it gave my phone a ton of viruses because that she weren’t there before the app and randomly when you hit one of the red walls it might take an extra cube for no reason. ALSO DON’T DO ANY OF THE UPDATES IF YOU HAVE THE APP. They only make it even worse. And just when you think you have a lot of cubes and it was a good round, there’s a huge pit or a bunch of barricades right at the very end that takes most of them away. I don’t want anyone to have to deal with all this ridiculousness so PLEASE save yourself the frustration and DO NOT GET THIS APP. IT’S REALLY AWFUL. I played the game until level 20, just to make sure I was letting all the features and shops open. This is definitely a fun, relaxing, and simple game that you can easily waste a lot of time on. However, with simplicity there should be some things to spice it up. Temple Run was simple, but had upgrades. This game does offer you to change your cubes and characters, but it stays mysterious until you make the purchase with the in-game currency of diamonds. I would love to see options to upgrade the length the magnet stays on, or going quicker when hitting those little green things. With that said, the “quick” green things don’t really make you move faster. It just adds lines to the screen to make it feel like it. I do like the fact that they give the option to buy out of ads for 2.99 as a lot of other games make weekly subscriptions or don’t offer it at all. All in all, I think it’s a cute little game and it will stay on my phone which is unusual for me! I just got the game like an hour ago. You can’t play level four!!!!!! I tried restarting my phone, restarting the game, skipping the level, even deleting the game and getting it again- it doesn’t work! The reason you can’t play the level is because the guy (also why can’t you change characters?!) and the blocks were all in visible. It said I died 2 seconds in to each game. I had to delete again. I tried again but it still wouldn’t work! I’ve seen other reviews saying the exact same thing from months ago and it still hasn’t improved? That just shows that no one at the company cares. I’m really annoyed! Also, even though you can still play the levels, the other levels so far have also been glitchy! The skip level button doesn’t even work. There are ads every level and they are all 30 or 45 seconds long. I had to turn off my WiFi the ads got so bad! What really is annoying is usually I am pretty flexible with glitches. But when it gets so bad that you can’t play the game? I can’t just ignore that! Also, your ad shows that the game is not glitchy at all but seriously? If you’re not gonna fix the game then make the ads match the game! Augh! It makes me really sad because I saw the ad and was like, that looks fun!

One complaint though is that the crates are not as fair as they should be. I realize the reason they did this is because it’s so easy to get the coins to buy them but still, they should be easier to get entire items instead of just 1 part. Or make the amount of parts you get more. Overall I rate this four stars just because of the crates thing plus I don’t like the skins that much and there’s only one map. I recommend. Thanks!

THE FOLLOWING ENTRY IS FOR PERSONNEL WITH ACCESS LEVEL 3 AND UP ONLY]  Date: 04/06/2016  Place: Area 52  Description: It's a rare occasion to see someone make it back from inside The Cube. The most well-known case is the 'Incident 1172-a'. A video recording attached to the incident report shows the portal open at 04:56:06 and spit out a man. Rising to his knees, this frail gray-haired man, dry like a mummy, and dressed in rags, broke the silence of the night with a drawn-out cry. Later it was ascertained that this man was a photographer from the ill-fated expedition that had discovered The Cube seven years ago. The man was completely deranged. He died within 24 hours, incessantly spewing out barely coherent nonsense, and constantly repeating the following: ""THERE IS ETERNITY"" (see audio recording 1172-1). An autopsy performed by Dr. [DATA REMOVED] uncovered a peculiar pathology: all internal organs, while being in normal condition from a medical point of view, were located in places within the body not typical for a normal human. It was as if an unknown force had scrambled them within the man... [END OF ENTRY]   MechCube: Escape is the next entry in the popular Mechanical Box series of puzzle games. Your character finds himself inside a mysterious structure simply named 'The Cube' for its shape. The place has many rooms. There's a control panel in the center of each room — a puzzle contraption, and if you can solve the puzzle, you will unlock passages to more rooms.   Each control panel is a unique enigma consisting of various ciphers, logic puzzles, attentiveness tests, puzzles to test your ability to correlate information, and the ability to think outside of the box.   Your character moves from one room to another and discovers all the puzzles in this manner. By exploring The Cube, the character will fall into deadly traps, and you will unlock colorful comic-book-style endings. The overall goal of the game is to find all the endings (most of which are secret) and collect all the hidden artifacts — various references to modern pop culture.

I see my review from wayyy back is still on the poster for this game to sucker in players. While in some ways this is still one of the closest to the original 8 pages game, in terms of graphics and such, the game desperately needs to return to its roots with earlier versions. The sheer number of ads that bombard the player takes away from the excitement, and its annoying how often they pop up on both the menu and everytime the player dies it asks if youd like to see an ad to continue. The life bar at the top is another thing that needs to go. Part of the fear factor in playing this is in not knowing when or if slenderman would get you. The depletion of the bar is a giveaway that your about to die and coupled with the fact that slenderman makes you look at him, its also cheap. Keep the face cam and everyplay record and share features however. Its cool to be able to let others see your replays. The new levels are good add ons as well. While i can take or leave the slender coin feature, some of the features you can get with them (night vision additional levels and a page finder) are cool. Keep these but do away with continues. In short, Return this game to being more like past versions from 4 or so years ago and perhaps keep the share features. Its annoying as hell to play as is. So... what makes good horror games? The answer is kind of complicated, and since this is really a simple game I will shorten the list. First off: atmosphere! The dark forest and sounds really set off a good place to die. Humans are social beings, and being alone is one of our major weaknesses, and Slender takes advantage of that. While this game is really difficult it is possible. The more pages you collect, the more aggresive Slender gets, following right behind your every step. Tension is also a big factor: you see the page, and get a rush of elation. But you see a gaunt face peeking out of the trees. Just the fact that you have to get the pages, but Slender might already be their makes it kinda creepy.While the game to play is not very scary (the enclosed ones like warehouse are creepier because sometimes you have to turn around and Slender might be there) sometimes it really gets your heart pounding. For me, the scariest part is whenever you are home in the dark, you remember this game, and don't want to move. However, it is much like Slender on the PC. The controls can be a little iffy at times, but it adds to the 'oh god' element of horror.ENJOY!

I wouldn't honestly change anything expect for the gems(rubies). I think that's too much, some people don't have money to buy the gems because you only give us 30 at the beginning and if we use it, we can't get it back unless we buy it for 2.99 at the cheapest price. It would be better to decrease the amount of gems to use for the premium choices or lower the amount of money that we can buy the gems for to 0.99 atleast. Maybe that way we don't have to worry as much for the choices we have to make in the story, for one not having enough gems or two the premium choices asking for too much gems from us. Plus most of the time not having enough gems can prevent us from choosing what we would like. I think every review on this app would appreciate if you could do something about the gems(rubies). Besides that, I'm in love with this beautiful story. I downloaded this game cuz I’m looking to play cute romance games and the guys are super cute and I liked the concept of it and I want to do Dylan’s route and the premium choices are expensive. I don’t like that and I don’t have money to buy gems. Not everyone who plays the game has a job and makes money but we are able to ask parents. But not every parent is gonna say yes to buy a few gems to waste them only on one premium choice. Okay, this game is AMAZING! The guys are cute, the grammar is great, and the story is so awesome! But the thing is the gems. Listen, we shouldn’t have to pay gems to get the good scenes with the boys. And if you’re going to do that, at least make a system so that every chapter we earn a gem at the end. Also, you prices for gems are ridiculous! Who wants to pay that much for such a small amount of gems? Like please get rid of the gem options! Other otome games don’t do this so please get rid of this feature.

All the bosses have one-hits, high stun chances, or reflect full damage back?!!?!! Like what the point in DEF it does seem to do much and it doesn't help that the lowest stats you get in the beginning. LUK does double damage but it caps at 60 but it doesn't seem to do much. My problem is the lag of weapon choices at certain point (FLAME SWORD all day) and DEF just doesn't seem to protect as much. LvL up isn't that rewarding less these ( +1 AllStats, +Match2, +Match3, +MaxHp) and these are in order of best to least. Individual Stats are ( +DEF, +ATK). LUK doesn't even matter but to easily assessable  so lvling that is waste of time.  At this point investing in high hp stack would be great to help avoid against being 1-shot. This game can be addicting if you enjoy games based on the luck of the draw. But what makes it even more addicting is the customizations you come across like various weapons and enchanted items that can give you an advantage.You can also go to the bar and spend your hard earned gold for the chance toincrease your total hp and luck which is invaluable in the later and harder levels you'll unlock.Yes, its simple and mindless, but its extremely entertaining if you're in the mood for a casual dungeon romp. This has been an all time favorite of mine for years. Tl:dr few good hours of gameplay, pleasant to look at, not too hard to avoid dying but if you die you start over, simple gameplay doesn’t take away from experience. Would recommend.This game is enjoyable to play although the gameplay is simple and only involves letting a slot wheel spin the lack of ads and retro design style make it better than almost all other games I’ve tried. According to other people it seems once you progress far the difficulty curve becomes too steep I’ve played for about three hours and haven’t found any issues yet. My only problem is that if you die once you restart but I didn’t find that to be a huge issue.

You have survival and creative mode, different creatures, different blocks, weapons, items, blueprints, and miniature blocks where you build inside a perimeter of whatever you want and it will become a 1 by 1 block of what you built which is handy for decorating. You can even create the model of a creature or weapon and give it special effect in the plugin library. There is multiplayer and downloadable maps as well. There’s even a plant which you can water every day and collect it’s fruit for loot and unlock the crafting recipe for a new item. There’s daily login reward, events, skins, drawings, and so much more. However, there is only 1 major problem that I have which is with the machines. There are many different machines but the rotator the one that seems to be glitched out the most. I tried putting all sorts of possible things to give it power for it to turn but it just wouldn’t move. So, I tried it in a different world and it turned like it was suppose to. But besides that, the game is really good. This game is really great and I really enjoy everything about it. There is so many things you can do, however there is a feature that should be added to multiplayer rooms, when you enter a room the host has the ability to remove you from the room and they don’t even need a reason, so I would like it if the host of the room has to have a reason to ban someone because I play in multiplayer rooms a lot and sometimes I get banned right away ( I’m thinking that some people do it because they want people that speak their language) and I think that is ok because maybe they want to make more friends and it would be easier if they speak their native language but sometimes it is ridiculous when someone bans someone from the room for a really silly reason for example the owner is really mean and is killing everyone in game and then they ban the people who run or try to fight back. So I would like it if they had to select a reason to ban someone like maybe cheating or anything reasonable at all not just because they want to. I love this game but it never loads it never does and when characters are talking most of the people playing are different languages like this game needs to be abled to translate almost everything because people in different countries speak different language and when they talk in chat you won’t know what there saying and it never loads the diy skin the stuff for it never loads and I think there should at least be a way to get more free stuff because most people can pay a lot so I say more clothing and fix the loading for mobile and iPhones and also translate for chat but the translate. also I think you should make a option to add a skin color and allow creative and survival in the same thing. Also please make the game free on pc because some people don’t have money it’s really hard especially when your a kid and make some skins for free it’s not really fair that you have to buy coins to get them but on the other hand it’s a very amazing game. Thanks for lisoning if you got this. ","Mini World Block Art, Miniwan Tech, Games, Adventure, Simulation, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

The rewards are awesome but I found out that I cant get any of the rewards unless I’m actually in the same level of when I can get the reward, also I hate the fact that I can’t get a specific summon, I also cant get the summon anywhere. I didn’t even know how to play at first so it was all coming to me too fast as well. So whatever you guys do don’t use everything you receive all at once. 😞 I kept dying a lot...overall its a great game to interact world chat etc. You can roam around freely in the game and see other players and fight them in the arena. To me it was hard to get every piece of information of how to actually play the game, you know specific small details such as the beginner quest😅😂 ps. Letter which btw I did not read or even see cuz you know while your playing the game you don’t necessarily check everything especially because they have so much written content on almost everything. I recommend this game for players who like online gaming for mobile. I absolutely love the game and the story I love a game with a good story I love everything about the game but two thing the level requirement to  continue the story and how hard it is to level up. Its just so hard to level up its impossible to even level up just once I don’t even level up once when doing daily tasks and I do all the tasks with EXP given. Daily tasks are supposed to help level you up to meet that level requirement to continue the main story and it just doesn’t work I really don’t think the level requirement is necessary because what’s the point of it when players and not just me but many others can’t get to that level requirement. If this issue keeps going on people are gonna get uninterested in the game and aggravated with the hassle with leveling up and this level requirement to continue to he story and uninstall the app and stop playing all together. I have a idea maybe to improve the leveling up issue maybe you can Boost the EXP given in the daily tasks because the EXP in the daily tasks is no where close to the EXP Given when you are doing the main story quests it’s a real big difference between the two and if you can’t do that then I think you should remove this level requirement thing to continue the story I hope you guys really think about the problem cause I and surely many of other people really love the game and don’t want it to fail. Thank you for your feedback!

But BEWARE, the controls can be quite irritating depending on the type of gamer you can be; if you’re impatient and like to be speedy tapping left or right of the screen proves to be quite trivial, but if your’e patient and slow I doubt you’ll notice this as a problem. The puzzles are fair and are similar on the level of the original game’s difficulty of puzzle-solving, though near the end of the game some of the puzzles can be quite dubious which personally led to some frustrating moments, (specifically something involving a piano and 5 portraits). In terms of the canonicity, without spoiling much, this seems to be completely separate from the main game. While it helps to be familiar with Tarsier’s world of Little Nightmares, there’s no need to HAVE to play the prior title to enjoy this one (though it’s HIGHLY recommended that you do)...For actual fans, I think the game does a good job at supplementing some new theories. All in all, the game works well, the environments are well done, and as a fan of the first game you should definitely check this title out. Very little nightmares is a good game with a few flaws. First off the sound track is really good, the art style is loyal to the first little nightmares, and for a mobile game it is a very fun experience.The flaws keep it from being perfect tho. First off I witnessed some game breaking up bugs like in the second to last level wouldn’t allow me to move no matter where I tapped causing me to die, “This happened a few times”. And some enemies you weren’t supposed to interact with would be stuck in place and you could walk on top of them. SPOILER WARNING:At the end of the game it’s revealed that you were not playing as six but as someone else. The reason I bring this up is because I have a personal complaint, I wanted to see how six got on to the maw and where she came from, while we do see a little of that, it’s very vague. And the story adds more questions than answers like how do the kids get to nest, and who are these new enemies you fight and why are they doing the things they are doing. But over all it was a fun experience and it is worth the money. So little nightmares is one of my favorite games on the planet. I’ve played both the original and the DLCs and I love them. I think this game is a great addition to the series and I like that it can be played on mobile. I love this game but it is a bit glitchy. My main problem is crashing.  Every now and then the game would freeze and then crash. Then when I reloaded it, I would be started back a  level or two. But then the main problem is that when I got to the end of the trash level and I was climbing up the ladder, the game froze and crashed but i tried to start it up again, every time I pressed play it would just crash again so I couldn’t play the game. I tried deleting things off my phone but it didn’t help. I ended up having to restart the ENTIRE GAME. That was really annoying, but other than that I love this game and I would enjoy any others made, just please fix the bugs.

However. I am so frustrated that I got to what seems to be close to the end. There is an impassable glitch in the room behind the pool where are you cannot select any of the hidden objects to cross them off the list. I have restarted, deleted, reinstalled, etc. and it’s obviously a glitch in the game. So frustrating!! What a waste of my time! This game was enjoyable with an engaging storyline until I got to the forest and then couldn’t find all of the hidden objects. Perplexed, I caved, and when I looked at a walkthrough, I discovered that I didn’t have the full screen option turned on in the game, and so some items weren’t even visible to me. The game would not let me turn on the full screen (there was apparently the option to do so, but when I clicked the button nothing happened), so I can’t finish the game, and I was just getting to the good part where the magic seemed like it was about to begin. I also noticed that there hasn’t been an update to this app in 4 years. I feel very frustrated and disappointed that I paid for a game I couldn’t even play all the way through and that I wasted so much of my time getting to the forest. I downloaded this game, because I had just finished The Da Vinci House by Blue Brain Games (absolutely incredible game) and expected that this game would be awesome since it was made by the same company, but not if you have a newer operating system. I should have listened to the one-star reviews. Lesson learned.*sighhhhhh* You guys outdid yourselves!!!!! My hubby and I have played just about every adventure game there is and this one was absolutely amazing!!!!! I mean the story was great, really great, the graphics were amazing and the game itself was like the energizer bunny, it just kept going and going and going.....every time we thought we were at the end, we were pleasantly surprised with more gameplay, more fun👍👍👍👍We just can't thank you all enough for the days of fun. All I can say for the bad reviews is that they just need to give it another chance because this game is FANTASTIC ","Mysteries of the Past: Shadow of the Deamon, Blue Brain Games, Games, Puzzle, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

HEADPHONES ARE COMPULSORY! AUDIO GAME FULLY ACCESSIBLE TO BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED PEOPLE Your eyes will be of no help. So close them, sharpen your hearing and your blade… And embark on an epic, perilous rite of passage. How do you play?  Put on your headphones and use your smartphone’s touchscreen like a joystick: - to move around freely; - to fight using your sword; - to defend yourself and protect yourself with your shield during epic fights; - to repel your enemies and perform combos! Live the adventures of Edward Blake, the famous blind knight! Guided by your daughter Louise, you must find your way and avoid the many traps that lie in store in the High Castle Kingdom, while confronting dangerous enemies! This serious game is fully accessible to visually impaired people, and is aimed at anyone who’s eager for an original, immersive sensory experience through a ground-breaking video game. And because the player is the character, it will help raise public awareness of this kind of disability. It is free to download and was co-created thanks to support from a community of fans who helped with the crowdfunding campaign (www.ulule.com/a-blind-legend) and in a co-production with France Culture, a Radio France station. This hack-and-slash game, with a heroic-fantasy flavour, harnesses the innovative technology of binaural sound, which delivers a gripping 3D soundscape and brings characters and actions vividly to life around the player – as if they were actually in the game! SOME REVIEWS: PC Gamer: “An interesting and enjoyable experience, something worth trying even if you're not visually impaired.” Next Power Up: “It's probably one of the most cleverly designed titles I've experienced in quite some time.” Gameskinny: “A Blind Legend is going to be one heck of an experience.” AFB: “I would recommend that anyone who is interested should download the game and give it a try.” Voxludicus: “The game is worth your attention if you want to try something different for a change.” Tapxrapidly: “The unique take of this game is that you do not need a screen to play, just headphones.” Deepdishent: “Take a shot in the dark and give A Blind Legend a chance. You may be surprised at what you find when you are not looking.”",https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/a0/d1/7b/a0d17bdb-5f46-4d2c-0c49-2c414234544f/mzl.lzucocam.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.2 • 85 Ratings,Free,,"October 27, 2016","As a VI User myself I was skeptical at how an ""audio only"" Game could be. To my surprise, ABL succeeded on all levels! The sound design was stellar! When you put your EarPods or headphones on you'll be transported to a magical world where chivalry is not dead and logic and fortitude are a must! This is truly a scintillating, 3- Dimensional aural experience. For each of the 27seems that you traverse through they are replete with all kinds of environmental sounds & sound effects native to that particular scene  . Each seen is a unique Realm onto itself, imploring you to fight mythical beasts, take on hordes of marauders and navigate through inhospitable terrains all to rescue your wife Caroline who was captured by the scoundrel king Thork! Game play is challenging but not impossible. The only criticism is it occasionally freezes, but a simple touch of the home button on your iPhone usually brings you back to where You left off, overall not that bad though. As for the profanity, I was lucky if I heard any more than several times the entire game. Just completing the game today I found this a incredibly fun experience! Sing this is my first audio game, ABL has set the bar high for other games to live up to! The immersive game experience is out of this world, the controls are also made so that the game has a challenging aspect to it in addition to the awesome story telling. This really embodies the present day hype with AI, but just with audio. A great game to play if your eyes are strained from the days work and want to relax your eyes but still have fun. Also a great way for those visually impaired to play video game :) Really hope there are more games to come out with similar mechanics and even more variety in gaming controls. I got this app several years ago when it first came out, and I struggled immensely with progress. Now, years later, I rediscovered the game and fell in love. It’s such a unique and immersive experience, and I absolutely love the challenges presented. Regardless if you’re visually impaired, I cannot recommend this game more. Take it from someone who doesn’t write reviews often, this app truly delivers an amazing gaming experience.

This story has so much promise and so many pieces left unfinished. With the ultimate climax yet reached, it’s a shame that this intriguing story is still unfinished. Choice of Vampire is in my opinion a wonderful thought that isn't executed effectively. The problems with this story is that it's too linear. Another annoying feature is that it forces you to partake in its confusing politics which introduces too many characters in such a short time. Lastly, a few people will be confused if they have similar play troughs, but I've found hat certain stats somewhat matter and will bring about an event you didn't chose. However, these actions feel weird and out of place. If you want to continue the first book, I say purchase it, but don't expect it to be too good. Both of the games were great, but I am to this day hoping you guys will make a third one, fourth one, and maybe even a fifth and sixth one? The game is very interesting to me and it would be a great experience to see how you guys would write a story as the timeline progressed and with it our characters strength and status. There are a lot of ""it would be's"" but really I hope you guys make at least a third game. Cheers!

They are good attempts at translating it, but you really need to find someone over here to proofread what you have written. (Everything that has to do with an investigation has to be precise, or localized diction.) I agree with your other top reviewer that the entire switching over to another screen when you make a mistake is too much, but I suspect that is to help populate your ads. That is possibly not necessary, and seems to people - like me, who work on Networking Equipment\Software - “may” be hacking into their device. I believe you are “Not Hacking” and safe to use for now, but believe that you should change that. You don’t need to add another screen in your app to run a 3rd screen. Whoever programmed this for you needs to fix that. I believe you did a “GREAT JOB” with this, and am looking forward to a “More Elaborate Version” in the future. Thank you for making this App. ****Update**** Mystery shorts is made by the same company and has the exact same questions but not nearly as many ads. I deleted this game after they tried to FORCE me to give 5 stars for a hint. No. You do not earn 5 starts from me. It’s a one star game period. Too many ads. Too many grammatical and spelling errors. Some of the questions and answers don’t make sense. For example, in the fourth mystery a man snatched a woman’s purse. The woman is in the right side of the street looking towards the car which is driving in the right side of the road. It gives you two vehicles to choose from to decide which car was the vehicle that stole from the woman. The car on the left has the steering wheel on the left side and the car on the right has the steering wheel on the right side. The car is driving down the street on the right side so you would think the correct car that stole her purse would have the steering wheel on the left but no. The correct answer was the car that has the steering wheel on the right side. It says the steering wheel would have to be on the right in order to snatch the purse from the woman since the woman was also on the right which does make sense but it also doesn’t. First of all, they don’t say that it was a drive by purse snatching. For all we know the man could’ve been on foot, stole her purse, and then hopped into a car and rode away. It kind of ruins the game when there are tricks like this. If there weren’t so many Ads. I’ve been on a crime kick lately and when I saw this app advertised I wanted to give it a try because who doesn’t want to try and be a detective solving crimes? BUT it is EXTREMELY frustrating when there is an Ad popping up almost every five seconds, and some of them you end up accidentally clicking on, without even realizing it, and taking you out of the Pocket Mystery app to download the advertised app. It almost takes out all of the fun of solving the crime puzzles. And I get that I can pay “x” amount of dollars to remove the ads, but let’s be honest, who actually pays to remove ads? Ads pay for the app. I don’t mind banner ads at the bottom of the screen, I don’t even mind ads popping up before and after each solved case puzzle, but ads popping up after ALMOST EVERY right or wrong guess for four questions is a bit ridiculous. Not only is it super annoying, it also throws you off trying to solve each case because instead of remembering parts of the case you already answered correctly or other bits of information, you’re completely bombarded and distracted by the ads causing you to forget the information at hand.Other than that, the game is enjoyable and addictive, and I’m already halfway through all of the stages.

I have already finished all the other characters available as well as every character in the Japanese version (I am able to read it so it’s easier for me] Though it may be that I know what happens to the MC and the characters I still wanna see the characters in the English! Overall the game is good, it takes a bit of time to grind for money if you don’t wanna pay for coins though, but still possible to get the amount in a certain amount of time! I also wish that you make more games! They are amazing, great quality, and have good characters! I have played all other ones up till now and they’re all 6’star high ranking, in my opinion, and I hope that this isn’t the last game because I am already excited to see the next game if there ever will be one! So this game is truly amazing and the romance is incredibly written but one of the characters, who should be the Joan of Arc is changed into a male, now named Jean. This is so highly problematic I can’t even explain so shortly. Joan of Arc was a real woman and her entire life story and significance had a major impact on women everywhere, it is essential that she always is interpreted as a woman. Her struggles were one only women could face and her successes belong to women, not to be washed up as a man. If there’s anything her life story has taught us- is to GIVE CREDIT TO WOMEN. The change of her gender is not only offensive- it is highly sexist and tone-deaf. She did not die her death only to be later dishonored and even stripped of her gender. I get it that this game is trying to appeal to straight female audiences but why not just use another male historical figure instead of changing a famous female historical figure? This is very wrong. If you really want Joan of Arc, keep her gender and write it as a wlw storyline. A real romance writer will know how to work with that, and if you can’t write wlw or anything lgbtq related- then just don’t write romance at all. Again, the game is written beautifully but PLEASE diversify it. Allow the MC to be available in all races, and allow routes for different genders. I love the story and the graphics and sound effects are really well done! I wish there were a way to just pay a flat rate for the stories, because it seems unnecessary to have a social/battle aspect to this game. All in all, I would recommend this with a little patience because it does seems to be a great story so far. Unfortunately, chapters are very short and it’s costly to try and progress if you consider paying to move forward. I’ve paid for other games before, but I’d say this is more costly than others compared to the length of the content that you get. For the free options, you can watch ads to get diamonds, but you only get 1 diamond per ad and there’s a limit on the ads. It’s disproportionately difficult to use this method to get free diamonds when I don’t believe there are any paid options below 100 diamonds. They also unfortunately use TapJoy which is glitchy at best and scammy at worst. I’ve never seen TapJoy work correctly in other games that I’ve seen that have it integrated. TapJoy is one of those companies that gives you diamonds in exchange for completing an action or purchasing something. It’s great IN THEORY, but I have never heard of it it working properly and it’s unfortunate that it’s linked with this game.

It’s a long, powerful, gripping journey where moral questions I never considered gripped me. I haven’t felt so attached to characters in a long time and the length of the story let the grow so well and become powerful and striking people. The story is nothing short of astounding. A tale and a concept I have never seen done and it was done so well that it was made to feel familiar in its approach. The ideas and the universe are so novel and new and exciting that it can seem overwhelming considering them but the story explains and paces it so well that it feels organic, smooth and almost caring. It doesn’t hold your hand but it doesn’t leave you high and dry in jargon or theory.What I found the most important and for me powerful element is that the story, centered around one relatively inconsequential question creates the entire plot, an entire discourse on ethics, morality, power and even life and asks some powerful question in the story and then answers them. Or better yet let’s you answer it yourself. It is truly hard to describe the elation I had at this story and just how much it moves me without spoiling it so I will wrap up here with this. I laughed and cried with the characters. I walked and ran with them and I danced and wondered with them. I was there and that is not something I can say about a lot of stories. Oh this is such a fun game! And I loved every character they were all sweet and 3 dimensional. They really do make you want to save everyone, especially Loren, such a sweetheart. The story was great as well, by the end, I felt like I’d just starred in my own gothic romantic adventure. I got the friendship ending where I saved everyone but didn’t date and I feel like my heart grew three sizes, it was so heartwarming. If I did have any feedback though, I would love the option to be of another race. Being non-white, it felt a little odd to be compared to Dev and Bastian as if I were white(such as the scene where you have to chose whether to go to town or send Dev, and it says something like “they might not take to well to him bc of his skin”. I remember bc I thought “😬 well they’d hate me then” lol). Speaking of, I really appreciated the attention put into identities in this game, in race, sexuality, and gender identity (there was even a poly option???). It was put in seamlessly, but it still felt like they weren’t just cosmetic identities. I loved it. Games should really follow this game’s example when it comes to diversity. This story was beautiful and I was attached to all of the characters by the end. You can tell how much care and craft went into it. I am so attached to the characters I would even love to play a sequel! I really felt their pain and was so worried when I thought they’d get hurt. I also enjoyed the diversity and especially Loren being nonbinary and the option to be trans. It felt a little bit unrealistic (it would have been great if there was binding in the story etc but it’s not necessary) but the story was fantasy so it was not difficult to suspend disbelief. The one complaint I have is that the romance all seemed very hurried. I wasn’t sure who to choose that quickly and was unsure if denying their advances at first would make them no longer romance-able. It was also frustrating because the choices all seemed to happen at very inconvenient times and so I would put off showing interest in them until a more convenient time but then they’d no longer be available. Spoilers: I was actually very sad when Dev and Loren got together. I love them both so much and I’m glad they found each other but I would loved to have been able to romance them both (that may have been an option but it wasn’t in my ending) or at least be able to choose one of them later in the story. Regardless, I’m so thankful I was able to get them their happy ending.

Please fix this I love playing this game with my best friend but when I getting ripped up by people that aren’t actually skilled and they pay to win I get so angry because you can’t do anything about it. Thank you for your kind words and critics as well. We will improve our matchmaking so that not paying users don't feel that bad about the game. If you have screenshots of unbalanced match and rating, win rate % information, please let us know, this will help improving. support@panzerdog.com I urge devs to read this because I’ll be including ideas for next update. I really enjoy this game and play with my brother every so often. I do have problems with it such as the unbalanced part when playing with guys who spent money on the game but I understand it’s pay to win. I would like to see some new maps such as the “Do not” map seen in images and the one with the choppers. New vehicles such as choppers added to much larger maps if the game could run it would be great. Attachments and different time set maps would be cool such as  night maps where flashlights are good. Seeing a PvE mode like zombies or even a coop story mode would be interesting. (I want to point out I don’t expect any of these to come out soon or ever but would throughly enjoy them in the future). I enjoy the new game mode you added but I barely get that one chosen. Maybe adding a select game mode option would be nice after more are implemented. Add a repair tool or wrench to fix destroyed cars. I noticed that when someone leaves the game, an A.I. Continues to play for you or the other person which allows for unbalanced matches which is bad. Either remove the person entirely or don’t allow leaving. Allow vehicles to survive longer but make the occupants weaker while in said vehicle. But most importantly, keep doing what you guys are doing because you have created a really good game that is so addicting that even when you lose you want to play again just to feel better. Ill start off by saying that I love this game. It’s action packed and has some interesting mechanics. My only complaint is being able to acquire coins in a decent amount of time is near impossible without spending hours playing daily or just spending real money. Some weapons you can earn coins per kill but I think that should be a feature with every gun, just more coins per kill for the more premium and higher tier weapons. We should at least get coins for winning instead of hoping for the random bonus spin which gives you a negligible amount of coins and none of the gold coins or doing “goals” that pay 30 coins. There should be a base bonus for winning in each rank. Realistically I can only spend my coins upgrading one weapon to even compete at my rank. Or I have to purposely lose A LOT of matches to get people of similar skill and weapon tier. That also makes some of the missions insanely hard to complete. Even if its just 100 coins per win and 5-20 coins per kill depending on weapon MK lvl I’d play more than once a week. Again great game, its just hard to stay interested when it’s so time consuming to save up for just one weapon upgrade that gives mild improvements for us broke people not willing to pay to win.

Please fix this issue I would like to continue playing the game but I don’t wanna keep losing my energy thank you... I really love it, my only critique would be that the time based pieces take way too long, especially for the first case. I already have five stars on all of the scenes and there is still over 11 hours left on the time based evidence. Longer times for later cases makes more sense because then you can go back and work on stars for the old ones but for the first one, I am now stuck with nothing to do but wait.

‎Endless Depths 2 RPG,"Endless Depths 2 is a rogue-like role-playing game that holds true to classic features such a randomly generated dungeon levels, a myriad of class/race combinations, a bunch of treasure to discover and a one-life-one-death difficulty level that can be quite addicting. In addition to what might be expected in a rogue-like RPG, Endless Depths 2 adds a level of persistence to the genre that allows for item farming, crafting, and even increased difficulty levels should a character make it to the end. Endless Depths 2 is a sequel to the popular Endless Depths and Endless Nights RPGs available in the app store.   It uses the TitanFire RPG system, which focuses on building a strategic defensive combat system.   This class-based game encourages a mixing and matching of classes, including special classes that can be unlocked as the character progresses.   Endless Depths 2 Features: * Classic rogue-like game play and turn-based strategy * Farm gold and gems that carry over from one character to the next * Craft items from the gold you've acquired (even gold gained from previous characters) * Start with 4 basic classes (Warrior, Adventurer, Cleric, Mage) and discover over 20 new classes as you progress * Start as 6 basic races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-Ogre) each with their own unique ability * The game starts over with increased difficulty should you defeat Mephistopheles Endless Depths 2 is similar to RPG classics like Rogue,  Angband and Diablo with a level of challenge similar to Dark Souls.

Handles great but looks like my childhood games. One of the worst things about randomly generated environments is that they often look totally fake and out of place.  Endless Depths 2 does great placing pseudorandom elements like hallway statues and fountains and altars to make dungeons memorable.  Great ""as you fight, so shall you level"" character development too.  Try a true retro RPG.  Take it from someone who was there! This is an incredible game, don’t get me wrong. It’s fun and addictive and well crafted. But recently I’ve run into creatures with 75% poison and magic resistance, weakness to light, and 100% resistance to literally everything else, including physical attacks. This is one case where I believe the game to be unbalanced, because playing a melee character means almost certain death when faced with one of these, especially since almost all monsters follow you RIGHT up your bum with almost no way to get away from them. We don’t need incredibly fast monsters that are 100% invincible unless you have very specific abilities. 5 default classes, 5 races, and apparently prestige classes (mix and match the default to get new ones for those not into d&d).Only gripe is control pad, which you get used to. AMAZING rogulike, and actually one, not a rogue-lite or anything like that.

Like all this dev’s games, originality and style are everywhere.  Ironic for a game that utilizes characters and art from their previous games. lolHowever crashes do seem to be a problem. The most egregious of these are while playing the arcade Buni minigame.  I was getting the hang of it and enjoying it, but it crashed several times trying to get past the third(?) stage.   Thanks for the game and the fixes! Fairly fun to learn card game but only a select few cards are usable and hardly any different variety to build a deck with that’s viable. If you farmed currency and collected all the cards from the 3 different packs along with finding the few hidden cards and hacker cards, don’t expect more packs from the second half of the game. In a way, Card City Nights 2 feels unfinished and I would not recommend this over the many other card games out on the app store. I was expecting more cards to choose from but was very disappointed when I wasn’t given any new cards after the first half of the game and then suddenly beating the game. I loved Card City Nights for its simple but deep gameplay, witty dialogue, and lovely aesthetics, and was initially worried when CCN2 opted to switch out the core gameplay so significantly. I needn’t have worried, though! CCN2 is a lovely game with a great backbone of a simple-to-learn card game with a surprising amount of nuance. Ludosity are masters of characters and music as usual, combined with a legitimately addicting card game across a silly little story on a radical spaceship. Play this game!

THERE ARE NONE!! So far I have not been forced to watch a single add in order to continue playing!! The only time an add has been presented to me, I was not required to view it. I am given the option to watch an add in order to receive a reward!!!! THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!! Most free apps/games out there force you to watch adds in order to keep playing and many FORCE you to watch adds constantly which I’m sure we all hate!! To sum it up.... I obviously love this game and the way it is set up. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, young or old, male or female!! I can’t wait to see what else is in store for me as I move through the levels.... gotta go.... I must play!!!! 😁Lisa Hi Lisa, A big thank you from everyone on the team for your feedback. We appreciate you taking the time to let us know what you think. You gave everyone on the team a big smile.Happy adventuring!The Wooga Support team I have been playing this game for quite awhile and I love it. But the last week or so I have started to stall. I have all the upgradable housing, and it cost so much to open the next scene that I can’t keep up. I have had to spend all of my Gems to speed up buildings because it takes so long for the higher flowered items to build. So I either have to buy a bunch of cheaper decorations that I don’t want because I have more than I want now or spend many days replaying the same scenes. (I have spent real money in the game - not a tone, but a bit and even with that, I am stalled. Part of this is because of the stay at home orders, I have had more time to play - with that in mind, I hope the developers will be adding more upgradable buildings (these really help with not getting board waiting to build up coin to buy decorations and then waiting for them to build- which can take 4-5 days to do that- all while having to replay the same scenes over and over) especially since the garden items that are possible with 5-star boxes seem to be feast or famine - my husband has received 4 frog fountains and 3 light posts from boxes, while I have only been able to get 2 frogs and 1 light (and I play way more and am about double his level) I know it’s random chance, but it does get frustrating at times. Hi there,Thank you for your feedback. We are always pleased to receive both positive and negative feedback, and suggestions from our players. We would like to thank you for taking the time to write to us and let us know how we can improve. Kind Regards,Your Wooga Team First, if you are going to send us surveys, let us comment on things vs just being able to select a predetermined option. I do like this game a lot however there could be some improvements!One- it is way too difficult and time consuming to earn purple diamonds; as you need them to expand island. Yes it helps when you can start gifting however you are depending on other people to return the favor and should not be capped at 6. The team idea was great and it is fun however when only 3-4 (of 15) only play it’s no longer fun as you cannot win or come close therefore why bother. Why waste all your coins if if gets you barely anything. You are better off playing your own island. Plus the team events are way to costly; 12 coins won’t even allow you to finish 1 set so again why bother. It is extremely rare you would have 300 coins to play so something different needs to happen here. Same thing with serving drinks; it’s only your group and again if only 3-4 people participate it makes the whole experience a negative instead of being fun like it should be. This goes with the purple diamonds and for those past 400 level..where are the other islands??  You run out of room way to quickly and can not gain more room quick enough so you are stuck. You can’t purchase an item as you don’t have room, so you can’t get flowers to move on, and so on and so on. Speaking of too much time- it takes WAY too long to renovate the lighthouse, church, etc. Hi there,Thank you for your feedback. We are always pleased to receive both positive and negative feedback, and suggestions from our players. We would like to thank you for taking the time to write to us and let us know how we can improve.  Regards, Your Wooga Team ","June's Journey: Hidden Objects, wooga, Games, Adventure, Puzzle, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

It’s I N S A N E! You literally can only enjoy the game if you have it on airplane mode, and there are still ads about getting premium and stuff. It’s basically not worth it.

This is old school all the way - even fown to the single developer working alone, just like those Atari 800 games I loved in the 1980s.The gameplay is simple (which I love), the goals are clear, the music is GREAT, and the graphics - perfect!  I don't like ultra-real 3D scenery except in racing games.  Loved the goatee on my character too.  I am happy with graphics just like these.  Loads of similarities to the original Wizardry (the ""stables - free!"" Was a giveaway), which again is a great thing.  I wish we had the original Wiz for iPhone...The price is very reasonable, I appreciate the developer's efforts (I read the credits, Jon!) and am going to enjoy finishing this little gem. Hi, Catman! Thanks for the review! You're exactly right: That very first Wizardry game for the PC all the way back in the '80s was a big formative influence on me, and it was fun to get to pay homage to it in Vigil RPG. :-) One of my absolute favorites. The graphics are budget, & the adventure is on the short side, but this is one of the most advanced & innovative games around. It's the RPG equivalent of an old school hot rod: strip away all the excess weight, supercharge the engine, then tune & balance it all to  perfection. The ""engine"" in this case is the combat system, and it's a nitro burning beast. I wholeheartedly recommend Vigil to anyone considering it, and I sincerely hope that AggroMagnet brings more games like this to market. Hey Discostallion, thanks for the super kind words! You pretty much nailed exactly what I was going for when I decided to make Vigil RPG: A fun and engaging combat system -- which is, after all, the bulk of what you spend your time doing when you play any RPG -- and just enough decent graphics, sound, and story around all of that to make it work. There's no sequel in the works as of right now, but if I once again get the itch to play a certain type of game that I can't find on the App Store -- as I did when I wanted to play a game like Vigil RPG, couldn't find one, and decided to make it myself! -- your kind words about enjoying Vigil RPG will be a big motivating factor! Thank you! I purchased this app after reading your interview on making a one-man game. Thanks for putting so much awesome info in the credits/acknowledgements. It is definitely challenging but also a lot of fun to play! I'll definitely buy your next game! Hey, MikeTMorpheus! I'm glad you liked reading the interview I did with TouchArcade; it was my first time doing something like that! As a solo developer, I did take advantage of many graphics and music assets that other folks had kindly posted online under Creative Commons and similar licenses, and I definitely wanted to make sure each and every one of those folks got credit for the cool stuff they had created! I really appreciate the review! :-) ","Vigil RPG, Jonathan Schneider, Games, Role Playing, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

It’s like the loony toons but with Henry stick man. But I wish there was a few more parts to it (or at least some more funny options even of they don’t work). Other than that, this game is amazingly funny and super fun. This game is funny and a little hard but the ad’s ruin it. it’s so annoying and I don’t want to pay to get rid of ad’s. I don’t think there’s a way to pay to get rid of ads. It’s just annoying they get you annoyed to the point of buying to get ad’s out of the way! I haven’t paid to get rid of ad’s and I won’t there are many FREE games that don’t make you pay to get rid of ad’s because they don’t have any. Or there like every 30min but this is ever 5 seconds. So if you ok with ad’s every 5 seconds to 2 mins then this is perfect. If not, this game is really fun you should still try it but beware of AD’s. This may seem like a funny game but its actually stolen content. Just from looking at the the title screen I that this is just a stolen game. The audio is also all glitched out too. I haven’t played the Original Escaping the prison but watching people play it, it never did that. Please don’t play this game. Its just a copy. This guy also didn’t seem to credit Puffballs United anywhere I looker, although I may just be wrong on that part. I don’t mean in the game itself. I mean in the app description. Like I said, This guy just copied the entire game and was too lazy to “fix” anything like glitches or the game crediting Puffballs. Please don’t download this app. Its a cashgrab.

We know there are purchases that we can make to enhance our gaming experience but we don’t need to be reminded every time we click on something. I understand ads pay the bills but this is ridiculous. It’s so many ads and pop-ups that majority of your time spent in the game is watching ads and exiting out of pop-ups, not playing the game itself. Other than that it really is a fun great game. I love the games like Coin King and Isjand King,  but although Coin Beach is good, too many interruptions of making you watch videos. You can take a tip from the other games.

I love this game but, You should have a bit more details about how to play the game in the beginning. I Dont know how to eat or store my things that I have collected when my inventory becomes full. Thank you 😊😊😊 I’ve been playing this game for 3 days, giving it a FAIR chance. Honestly it has potential, the open world, building things, crafting, surviving. It’s awesome. Although there’s a few things that I’ve caught. There is no way to craft anything to store extra items. ? Like I’ve got to search for all these things to get energy and water, but if I put down a item to get another one, it will just automatically disappear and I cannot pick it up when I’m finished. That being said, my inventory is full, I can’t loot things or mine the rock or ground because my inventory is full, can’t find out which item does which, nothing has a name, no sense of being organized. It’s just messy. So messy. Hey do you know do you know what would be great or multiplayer just think about it surviving together as a team please add this I would give it five stars already dead but I’ll give me more five ⭐️  Please have this game creators please listen to me please ","X Survive: Building Sandbox, Victor Kirillov, Games, Entertainment, Simulation, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I especially like how the boss weapons are organized in their boss header, and included in the weapon type lists. My only (minor) gripe is the scrolling through the item lists could be more responsive. Not a whole lot to this app. It gives information great to have at your fingertips while playing the game. Item descriptions and some great information upgrading weapons. How the upgrade process works, the math behind each upgrade and the locations of items needed to make the upgrades. Even though there isn't a ton of information in the app what is there is definitely worth the money. Make the purchase. This app to start off, is phenomenal and very ambitious. The display is very ascetic as well as pretty accurate descriptions and contains very helpful information. However it is missing rings, as well as other minor details. Also, Scholar of the first sin, boss stats, merchant locations, and level description. If these things are added overtime, this app would be a 5 star app. Again, full of potential.

I am a huge fan of the developers and have all of their other games. The reason why I refrained from giving 5 stars is because of the price. I’m not opposed to purchasing a game, but if I do, I expect it to come with all the usual game features. In previous games by the developer, you could fast travel and get hints without purchasing them. In this new game, you have to pay additional fees to unlock fast travel and hints, on top of paying for the game. I was a bit bummed and deterred by this, but made it work without these features. Syntaxity,Since finally trying Blackthorn Castle last year, I was thoroughly impressed by the lack of glitches, smoothe gameplay with a functional and easy to use User Interface, explorative setting locations, challenging yet not too difficult to beat, quality graphics, realistic style, sound effects and music as well as the adventurous nature of these games.  One after the other, I tried each game and delightfully found the same satisfaction in all (current) six.Then, you released your bountiful update for the Lost Ship, which was originally much too short.  Now seeing the pattern of adding similar updates and extra content, in order of original release, I eagerly await more to be released.If I had to describe these games, in as few words, I would say they are honestly must-haves and instant buys for this genre.  If a new game were to be released, I would buy it as soon as I found out about it.  Having them all up to now is not enough because they are so satisfying.  But there's more.I discovered an interesting alternative to their replay value.  Sure once you play them you might get tired.  I liked Blackthorn so much I kept replaying it, but with an unexpected challenge I put to myself.  Memory.  I've repeatedly played them several times each as a way to stregthen my memorySo, I look forward to each new game/additional content Syntaxity releases.  To be honest, you couldn’t release add-on or new game content fast enough.Thank you. I’ve been a longtime fan. Have played every game from this studio. With this newest installment the developers are charging an in app purchase in order to unlock fast travel!!!!!! A feature that has previously been free in past installments!!!!!  No fast traveling makes gameplay tedious but there is no way I’m paying an extra dollar for fast travel in a game that I’ve already paid several dollars for. Hints are also behind a paywall, which doesn’t really affect me other than being annoyed that the company is squeezing you for every cent you’ve got. I  won’t be buying from this developer studio again. A real shame because the titles up until this point have been entertaining. So unfortunate when a company is so greedy that they nickel and dime you for basic features when you’ve already paid a purchase price for the app. Thank you for your feedback, it is very important to us that our customers enjoy our games. If you would like, please contact us. We would like the opportunity to make the game experience a good one for you. Best regards.

‎The Curse of Issyos,"The acclaimed indie game The Curse of Issyos is finally available for iOS and tvOS devices, after years of popular demand. Enjoy this renowned game created by Locomalito, author of other gems such as Cursed Castilla and Super Hydorah, on your big or small screen. ► LevelUp - “A great reconstruction of the action-platform genre of the eighties”. ► Indie Games Plus  - “The Curse of Issyos is yet another fantastic example of the man’s love for old games and the care he puts into his work”.  ► Destructoid - “It's a hard game, but it feels very fair. It's all about watching and learning, and then skillfully pulling off attacks at the right moment”.  Defkalion was fishing at the quiet blue sea when he heard the voice of the Goddess Athena. “Hurry up”, she said. “The isle of Issyos has been cursed by the Olympus!” And so, fearing for his daughter Delia, his only family left, the fisherman sails back to his home, where the adventure is about to begin. The Curse of Issyos is a retro-styled action platformer with nothing but the classics of an old 8-bit game: a good bunch of enemies and bosses, linear and open scroll levels, secrets to discover, and a background story inspired by Greek mythology. It doesn't try to mimic a retro system in particular, but it's coherent with its own limitations in the use of colors, sprites and chip sounds.  Features: ● Compatible with MFi, XBox One and PS4 controllers. ● Haptic vibration. ● iCloud support. ● Game Center achievements and leaderboards. ● Play in landscape or portrait orientation. ● Look and feel of a console game from 1987-1988. ● Based on Greek Mythology. ● 30+ soundtrack by Gryzor87. ● 7 levels, 9 bosses and more than 40 unique enemies. ● A secret level that can change the curse of the game. * Game texts in English only.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/6c/1b/05/6c1b05a7-70c5-9ad7-6c85-5ac3693e71b7/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,An epic greek adventure,4.4 • 27 Ratings,$2.99,,"September 18, 2020","I love that this is a retro “pixel” game that “plays by the rules” of actual 8-bit gaming: limited palette, pixels are all the same size, animations take place on a pixel grid, actual “chiptune” soundtrack. A lot of games that try to look like this fail because they aren’t faithful in these ways. The gameplay is smooth and gratifying on a SteelSeries Nimbus on Apple TV. So glad to finally have a great platformer on tvOS. Worth many times its price. I can’t wait to keep playing! The game is great and the music makes u feel like ur playing nes game The only problem is the control is to small and most of the time i press down instead of forward and that’s really annoying and makes u get hit from the enemy so please have floated control and adjustments for this fix control and then I’ll say 10/10 is this game worth ","The Curse of Issyos, Abylight S.L., Games, Action, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

But sadly the game lacks in a lot of areas animation quality, balance, weapon variety, customization, map and game modes.Although graphics are surprisingly attractive the stiff and up smooth animations distract you from the beauty of the game. The weapons are horribly over powered killing opponents with one shot to the foot while the player can survive an onslaught of close quarter unrelenting fire. There are a few weapons in the game but the variety needs heavy expansion and proper class organization. Player and weapon customization should be player choice, if you going to include custom skins and attachments in the game let the player choose which skin and attachments to equip or choose to go full default. So far the game seem to have 3 maps all of which are chosen at random when you play the 1 multiplayer mode, more modes and maps are heavily needed like (Free for all, battle royals, capture the flag, gun game, domination, kill confirmed, search and destroy, etc) also the ability to choose which mode and map you want to play.It may look as though this game is bad, but actually it’s a very enjoyable fully offline time passer in its early state, but it has a lot to improve and build on. It’s very hard to come across good graphic offline FPS games that don’t require any sort of internet connection. The things mentioned above is to help change this game from being mostly graphics to being a well rounded and fun totally offline experience. So here’s to hoping the developers maximizes on this games potential.

Immerse yourself in 1990s nostalgia and the intimate details of private lives in this impressive achievement of interactive storytelling. I honestly don’t know what to say I love this game so much because it was so addicting and such a good mystery there’s nothing chasing you and you can do it at your own speed but the problem with it is the first time I played I got glitched in the doorway but when I restarted it and I clicked new game I finish the game with in like two hours this game is amazing awesome and fun but I really want to find Sam you guys should make a second one that’s a tiny bit cheaper but is you actually are finding where Sam is I almost cried at the ending because it was so sad and so happy and I was so proud of myself too and I would pay for a new version but this game is definitely worth buying I’m not gonna lie, I was bored and downloaded this game not knowing anything about it. I saw pictures of a creepy, dim lit house and the mechanics of what looked like a puzzle game but I was very surprised when I realized I was basically playing a walking simulator story based game. I was disappointed in myself for not looking in to it before paying $5 but thought ok I’ll play through it maybe the story will capture my interest. Now look, I’m all for equality and rights but the story, dialogue, and characters were all so beyond cringe to me it got me mad. Nobody in real life speaks like this, acts like this, thinks like this is what I kept saying to myself throughout the play through. There are no twists, no thrills and no fun in this game. The gameplay consists of walking around and reading notes scattered around the house and that’s it. So why not just make it a short story or film? I do not like games like this, Florence, and Old Man’s Journey where it is clearly meant to be a short story or video but they throw in some nonsense gameplay element in it.

The controls are simple but yet effective. The gameplay is good for beginners but you will need practice to be good. (Personally love that game design). The design of the graphically is AMAZING to say the least. It’s runs very smoothly (around 60-80 FPS witch is unheard of in mobile) the graphics and game art style is AMAZING. The character roster is really really great with characters for every different play style. And I love how that added a competitive mode with all of the characters unlocked and all moves unlocked. But Man I wish mobile would let us the skin of the character you own in competitive, like it would still be competitive but it would let me use my other big band costumes but only the skin not the stats, like an ult in smash bros or other fighting games or like in 2nd encore we’re they let you use a skin, and I want it because I want to show people cool looking characters and stuff but I don’t like playing free for all because not only people with characters that have the power level advantage would win 90% of the time, but the good thing is you can show off the cool characters. So if the game devs are reading this please add a feature we’re we can use the character costumes in competitive. This game is really really worth a download and playing and I’m only asking for one thing and that is to let us use our character costumes in competitive. Hey there,Thanks for the great review! Expanding the options and features of the online Versus mode is definitely something we want to do eventually. I can't give any specifics yet, but it's definitely on our radar! Best Regards,~HVS~ This game is absolutely great in every way possible. If you know you can handle it. It’s not for everyone. You need good hand eye coordination, and just being mature enough as you will enjoy the game even more. Getting premium credit is not difficult once you master how the system works a and how to properly use a good number of the 12 different fighters. I currently use Peacock, Squigly, Ms. Fortune and Beowulf really well now. Just playing a good amount that you get comfortable using combos and adapting makes it even more enjoyable. It will get slow after day not gonna lie but once I persevered and continued to keep players by I was rewarded with having lots of fun and getting excited to start getting silver tier and hopefully soon enough a gold tier. If you get stuck, you must remember as I don’t see too much help online,Don’t sell anything (yet)Upgrade Bronze even if you know there are silver and gold characters. (They are still good to have)Take risks that fit how well you play. I also love the comments some of these characters make after winning a match. I’m still laughing after the fact. Getting fully immersed in the story will be amazing for you. There are so many good things to say that you should just stop reading and play already. Thanks for this awesome btw, developers. Music is great, graphics is 200% on point, no glitching EVER and I’m happy to be playing! 🤩🤯🤗🤟🏻👏🏻👌🏻 I downloaded this game a couple weeks ago and i’ve been grinding a lot, almost every day, and I can’t seem to get enough of the game. I haven’t spent a cent but I can still get as far as everyone else by just playing. this game is hilarious, from intro/outro lines, but it even has JOJO REFERENCES. I could leave the review here from that last point alone but I have more praise for this game. I love the gameplay mechanics, they’re easy to learn and when you can eventually hit like 30 hit combos you feel untouchable. Another good aspect of this game are the constant updates and daily/weekly challenges. they keep the game interesting without necessarily getting repetitive. I’ve never gotten bored playing because as soon as i’m getting tired of fighting AI in story mode and prize fights, I can challenge myself on versus where you can win with numerous strategies and there are infinite possibilities of good teams to destroy people with. this game runs incredibly smooth, and i’m playing on a 4 year old iphone 8 with pretty much no storage left, but this game is the smoothest game i’ve ever played on IOS. hard to believe this is a phone game. basically this game is god tier. admins if there’s one thing i’d like to see different is that i’m coming to the end of story mode even tho i’m lvl 48, and the story is mad interesting too, so i’d love to see continuation if that’s possible.

Sprint for the leaderboards in the sequel to one of the App Store's most popular endless runners, which arrives with a host of fabulous improvements, from overhauled graphics to refined controls, original minecart and zip-line challenges, and much more. Originally this was my favorite game. As time went on they made more and more variations and maps for the game, which was fine. Lately, however, now that they’re on the money grubbing bandwagon, I noticed fewer coins on runs when you needed them. And as if that wasn’t enough with all the money they must make on selling people gems and coins, they’ve added aggravating ads. I must admit that I tried to buy out of the ends and for over two weeks they still kept showing even after I received my notice that payment was received. However I must amend my previous review because they did contact me through email, and the developers gave me directions which did in fact remove the aggravating ads. The developers have since asked me to revise my review, but I had been ill for a while. The review is deserved, and I have brought it back up to a five star. I always did love the game I just hated the ads. And now for a very reasonable price, you can get rid of them too thank you so much for helping me with this problem. I apologize for the delay in correcting my review, but I have had some health issues which thankfully seem to be subsiding. It’s a great game! I’ve been playing this game for a long time (at the very least five years) and although I’ve stopped for periods of time, I always come back. The new maps and characters are always amazing, and the global challenges are great.HOWEVER. There’s always a however. Other people have talked enough about the ads so I’m not going to talk about that. Something that bothers me a lot is that now coins and gems are practically useless besides Head starts and Save mes. Before, you could use coins to buy new characters or outfits and gems to buy new characters and maps. However, now you can only unlock the new characters on special events and you need to purchase the maps with real world money.As I said, I’ve been playing for a long time, so I don’t know if the older characters and maps are still able to be purchased with coins and gems. But Pirate Cove, Volcano Island qnd Enchanted Palace (and its characters) can only be purchased with dollars and I think that’s very unfair.I understand that you guys need to make money, but I would hope that ads, Usain Bolt and people purchasing packages and coin doublers in the store would be enough. There’s no need to block most of your users from obtaining maps and characters, they should be able to be gained by putting hard work into the game and earning coins and gems.Sorry for the long rant, but I wish you would take these comments into account and make these assests achievable for anyone. Hello Runner, we really appreciate your feedback. We shall forward your message to our developers so that they can review and consider. We really thank you for your continued support and suggestions to help us improve the game. Thanks and take care.

Well, more roles in general. Excluding more pro roles, I think 32 is enough. I have some role ideas here: Survivor, just wants to survive to end of game, Can protect self once from anything. Even ignition. Ametur Hunter, If the hunter dies, then the Ametur Hunter will take his/her place. This next one I do not have a name for, but it is like a normal villager, but it is immune to ignition. Mother Nature, It checks each night to see if somebody is a werewolf. If it finds all werewolves Werewolves win. Mother Nature is part of the werewolves team. Juggernuat, it kills once every two nights, it is as powerful as ignition and is immune to werewolves. (Not Serial Killers or Arsonists.) Copycat, It is like Doopleganger, but it selects an alive role to become. Also I think Amnesiac would be a better name for Doppleganger, but that would be copying TOS. (Town of Salem) That's all, I hope you add 1 of these 6 role Ideas. ( Edit ) There's a glitch where you press to watch an ad to get gold but it doesn't do it even tho the internet is fine, Also, the Avenger doesn't work. Please fix these! I love this game so much! It already has a ton of AMAZING roles! Trust me when I say it spending the extra 2.99 is worth it. One thing I wish you could do is add all of the roles that are in the online version because I feel like I spent the money on this game to go and find out that I could have all these rolls for free on the online app. So I feel like it would make sense to add all the rolls from the online app (some of them might not work... like the medium because you couldn’t really pass the phone back to someone who is out of the game). If you could confirm if you are working on this that would make my day and make this game 2x better than it already is! Thanks so much!!!

Some things could make this game even more amazing, maybe adding more levels, weapon and more customizations, for example maybe choosing difficulty in each misssion and survival level (this could be done by adding more zombie spawns or subtracting), and possibly customizing the survival match by choosing what zombies you want to face (like in boxhead where you select or de-select zombies like the acid spitting one and red one, altering difficulty and changing final score) also add  a kill count on the end of each level would be nice, maybe even add other ai survivors to help you on survival after outliving or killing a number of zombies. This game is near perfect, with these updates, it will be Godlike. In my original review I took issue with the sound problems the game developed after various iOS updates. Surprise! the game has been updated with 64 bit support and is ready for iOS 11. This is a creepy game about battling the undead as you desperately try to stay alive. You'll battle threw various areas as you try to not become an undead happy meal. Though maybe not state of the art graphically, it does what it needs to do to put the player in a world gone bad. The graphics are nice and the sounds and music are fantastic. My thanks to the developer for not giving up on this great game.

The flight controls are still angering, but other than that it’s a pretty good game.You go on quests. There are bosses, Mini bosses and wild animals you can take on! Tame animals!Well, sort of.Players should be able to tame any animal they come across rather than the set three (Sabertooth, Wolf, Dragon). I like how the amount of land there is in the game is increasing, and that the graphics are decent. The gameplay time is still at a small, and the same concept of nymphs and books is still there. In your next game, here is what I suggest:I noticed there was a black and white dinosaur model that looks kind of like a spinosaurus (without the spine) and I like it a lot. Maybe you could center it around that one?Maybe it could have that power tree I have talked about in my review of “Clan of Dragons”, and maybe you have to grow your dinosaur (actually growing it) and going on a newer concept. Like:1. You hatch (with a sibling?)2. You learn the basics (hunting, drinking)3. You go out and collect materials for armor and defeat bosses while growing4. Daily quests!Again, these are all ideas, it’s your game and your models and these are only suggestions 😁Thanks! I have played quite a few simulated games and I’m trying to say this in the nicest way possible but there are a few of things That bothered me about this game and I literally just just downloaded it and tested it out on my iPod because I was curious and here’s what I think should really be fixed if anyone else has these problems.1.the controls are frustrating .2.the ads display around maybe every 5 seconds or so which I find annoying but if the ads weren’t all that constant I would probably like the game more.3.the game froze up while I was playing it and I had to press the home button it was showing the screen but I couldn’t do anything in the game  which is really annoying because at least make the screen go black or exit the game or something pls.If you fix this then I might consider playing it again but I honestly don’t know if I liked it that much I mean you couldn’t really do anything but what the game told you to and I think you should add a free play option and please fix the other stuff that I mentioned if possible and if you made it this far thx There is a few bugs when I get a mushroom and I try to tame an animal it sometimes the animal will stared to glitche and i wasted a mushroom and then I have to delete the game and download it back I have do it over 50 times ","Tamed : Arctic Survival, Boris Tsarkov, Games, Role Playing, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

A lot of work has obviously gone into the imagery and the music and the gameplay and the scares. The ""inventory wheel"" works quite well (except that it would be good to be able to control the rotation of the object displayed in the middle). My only negative criticisms are that the gameplay is quite short (markedly shorter than A Short Game) and the ending is a bit rushed, directorially speaking. Navigation is occasionally a little disorientating. There are a few scenes that are richly rendered but turn out to have only one thing you can do in them. And... the piano scale is incorrect (A to C should be a minor third, not a major third). All that said: a lot of work has gone into this and I enjoyed every minute of it. Ok I got stuck at the first game. Spoilers: there is a book that gives you hints but leads you to a flash drive that is blank. Ok all you needed to do is have a message on it like look for 4 letters and oh by the way they are not in the right order....THIS is the key. Then I would be like oh I get it, I can move on. But if you never catch on, you are stuck. Not everything was clear what clue went with what game. When it did, sometimes you didn’t know the order, then you were stuck again. I had a recording and a piano and didn’t know which Key was which. Looked at the top picture and still nothing. Then there was a missing key, do I need that to complete it first? No, but I’m stuck again. Then it was like ok I got 2 keys on the right, 3 on the left. Do I really need to just guess? Come on. When you get stuck there is no other room to go to. Then, you don’t know if you are focusing on the right rooms. I gave it 3 stars because I played a free glitch game and loved it. The one I paid for just frustrated me. So I love these guys. Love glitch games. What they did with Forever Lost and Ferris Mueller were great, and I'm giving this an extra star to boost them for that.Wasn't crazy about this one.- Don't like the new inventory and camera system. While the screen looks cleaner, it feels like more button presses and tap-hold-slide-slide to get where you need to go. More polished, harder to use.- This game felt more closed and episodic than their other works. The house ""resets"" periodically, meaning things change and new things come available for you to interact with, but not until you've already solved the puzzles up to that point. So I always felt like I was dealing witha small world and small set of puzzles at any one time. - Not a fan of the paranormal theme. If you have found yourself looking at this game, I encourage you to go get all three Forever Lost titles, Cabin Escape, and Ferris Mueller. They are all excellent.

My biggest disappointment was that lack of threat there is. There is not really much to worry about. The game is almost too easy. There are not that many items and really nothing to discover or unlock. More things to gather and possibly fishing would be a start. You can’t use spears while walking or running. Even the “red” threat level characters go down in a spear or two. There is never enough enemy to kill you. You can take the time to gather the items you need to build guns or other things but why when it is basically given to you through supply drops. It is not a challenge and is only fun for a little while. You have to be standing near the furnace for metal to keep being created, and that can get really annoying. This game could be really good with a lot more development. More enemies. More items. Possible an enemy that will wander more. I would like to have a sense of some sort of danger to be on the lookout for. A map would also be amazing. Different terrain would make things a little more interesting. Larger creates to put things in is also a thing that would be amazing. Even the metal boxes don’t hold very much and you have to have a lot of them. Overall I would not waste your time on this game. Not enough to keep you busy and interested Hello developers, I hope you read this so you can make this request your priority to improve this game. First of all, this game has lots of potential and much better than the last Survival simulator game. Just a few requests to make this game really good. First of all, remove the in game ads so this game is actually playable! I don’t care if you have ads when you exit or enter a game but all I ask is don’t put ads while playing the game. People will not like that and might quit if that keeps up. Secondly, there needs to be a way to respawn to your base or put a home symbol on the minimap. Like Survival Simulator, the bed should be a waypoint to your base. This will avoid people losing their base and would make the game a lot more smoother. Last thing, there are a few bugs that should be fixed, one is when I drag a item to another hot bar, sometimes it freezes on the screen and I see it even when I close out of my inventory. Also items tend to randomly disappear for no reason, that should be fixed. Anyway I think these requests should be your main priority to make this game improve. More people will download when these are fixed. Also soon plz add multiplayer! Thanks.

Artfully blending bold colors, stirring sound design, and intriguing puzzles, the game establishes a contemplative mood sprinkled with moments of joyous surprise, ensuring the experience sticks with you long after you stop playing. Walking and sailing through the pop-up book Japanese landscape is a lovely experience. No mayhem, no extreme brain-bending puzzles. More akin to an artwork than your average game. The clues provided are just enough to keep you exploring. I definitely wanted the game to last longer and also wished for a more engaging story line. I hope the team comes up with another, more complex adventure in the same style. This game is a great idea, but it feels like a prototype of a full game. Not quite polished enough and too short.The puzzles are sometimes so simple that you end up looking around for a more difficult solution only to be surprised that all you have to do to solve them is count things. A lesson could be learned from games like The Room.The game in general is beautiful, but there are certain details where shortcuts seem to have been taken and more fluid movement of the character could give the game a more complete feel. It feels like some movements of the character were skipped to come back to later perfected (only they weren’t).And finally, the game is really short. Like one hour worth of gameplay. It feels like the designers developed a few levels as a prototype and then they just never developed any more. For the $3.99 price, it feels like you should be getting more.Great idea for a game, but just seems like someone rushed to get this out the door when too many things were left unfinished/unperfected.

The only thing is.. They should make it more realistic. For instance cubs should grow up, and I realized that as you walk along everything loads as you approach it, which means there is a blank horizon, which makes it seem less real, should have completely loaded horizon. Lastly, Gluten  free games  should not let you eat an animal as big as an elephant in one bite. I know they have a policy against blood or gore but they should at least let there be bite marks on the animal as you eat it. However, though I still recommend this game since it's pretty fun  to survive in the jungle and desert. So I thought instead of having a little home spot BORING you could have a den similar to the one in the lion sim and there could be a hole so you can go in the den also you should have a lot more Cubs like six 2 at level 5 and the rest at level ten and there should be water falls and you can transport to other simulators that the player has and you could have wars with the animals from the players Simao you have to have a bigger map to all the sims that the player has and you can pick things up with your mouth and steal animals Cubs (the ones from the players sims if they have any) and when you bring it to your home/den there would be an button that says ""raise""and if you press it the cub is yours although there would be a 98% chance that the parents would be looking for its cub or pup and there would be different ways to steal Cubs or pups make the next update on my birthday August 14th bye I love this game❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😂😊😊😊😊😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😊😎😎😎😎😎 I have a few suggestions , the Tigers head looks smaller than its body so make it bigger if your going to make a ultimate tiger simulator also the control movements need fixing  you should update them to uws controls.

I understand you need ads but do you need to let the game keep playing while an ad is playing. Just now I almost killed Bigfoot and a bear saw me, I started killing it when an ad played, all I heard was the bear growling and my character grunting, when I could skip the ad I had 1 hit point left, pure horror, the last thing I saw was a bear on its hind legs, growling, striking then...game...over. Please fix this, like, pause the game while an ad is playing or place the ads differently, please. Thank you for reading my review. This is a really fun game to play, I can see the idea behind it, but there is so much that you guys can do to improve it that it honestly hypes me up. Some ways in which you guys can improve the game are:             ———-: change the way that you land, make the landing more realistic, also have there be dead bodies around the map(it will give the game more anxiety)....Have there be more missions other than just killing bigfoot, maybe having you save someone that bigfoot has captured or something like that...the map needs to have more to it like more structures more places to explore-Now one big thing is co-op online if you guys are able to get online multiplayer into this game it would be HUGE-ex. Let players create a gameroom so that you can play with your friends and 2v1 Bigfoot. That would be very fun......Also the ads that keep poping up when u play are annoying it would be nice to remove those...those are just ways that u guys can improve the game because I believe I can be a very good game, but other than that keep them updates coming guys💪👍👍 This game is great! The graphics aren’t too bad, but it’s good enough that you can actually play the game. But it is missing some things and stuff that needs to be removed. For instance, i’m pretty sure no one likes ads popping up every minute or so when your getting attacked by a giant ape in their own home. And bears, they need to get removed. They are too buggy, and frankly they are the only thing you worry about when your out in the forest. You worry about them more than you do worry about Bigfoot. And when I had spawned it I was instantly attacked by them. What it’s missing: A storyline. There is no reason your hunting Bigfoot, you just jump out of a helicopter WITHOUT a parachute. Which is weird. Why can’t the helicopter just land instead of jumping out all Fortnite *cough* Fartnight! Style? You just land at a house in a forest. Anyways, the rest of the game is wonderful!

IMO, this one took it up a couple more notches with greater puzzle interaction, greater depth of story, greater length, and, of course, an extra helping of “I can’t believe that just happened!”. For me, it was insanely fun, and even though there were a couple things I didn’t quite understand, I still managed to get through it without any help, so I’m feelin’ like I’m ‘on top of the cave’. To boot, the end of this one leaves you with an ominously creepy feeling about what’s coming next. I can’t imagine how they’re going to top this one, but fortunately, I don’t have to, cuz I’m getting ready to download the next one. I’m already savoring the anticipation😋. Update:Still can’t finish. Made a mistake in order of navigation of points on radar with no way to correct & no way to get the next cube.  After 3 attempts just deleting this chapter. Watching the walkthrough to see how it comes out. Hopefully “Paradise & Paradox” chapters are better thought out. Too bad, still love the series, but disappointed that developers didn’t foresee this.***************************Love the series, but very frustrated with the ink bottle glitch. Took the ink bottle in part 2 early in the game which apparently caused something to break & after watching the walkthrough (tried the hints) no fish would appear. Restarted part 2 waiting until after getting the pearl to take the ink bottle. Tried a couple of different settings on the radar, now I’m stuck again because I can’t change the settings & get the black cube or octopus.  Again checked the walkthrough & found I can’t change the settings on the radar. OMG, have to reset again. Really! DEVELOPERS, Please fix so the ink bottle doesn’t mess up the settings & freeze the radar. Will reset again because I love the Rusty Lake game, but I’m soooo frustrated. Incredibly well made. Although it’s not my most favorite cube escape, this was still really up there on the list because of how well the game was made. I absolutely adored the additions of how you could interact with things. The graph bit where you had to find a point and travel there by changing the direction and moving forward was also a nice touch, along with the book and how you had to look at one thing and figure it out gradually. Very well made, I have no doubt paradox will be just as good if not better.

I found that just letting it drop works, but doesn’t seem to be a great mechanic when your fighting against the clock to not get too much loot when your being forced to wait for the animation to finish. Also, Overloot happens waaay to often to be considered a penalty, I’ve gotten it 3 times in a row between monsters after watching an AD to stop it, this just feeds in the suspicion that it’s probably been adjusted to get AD revenue out of players to prevent any in game loses Hello Zom! We are sorry you encountered issues with the board, we have greatly improved the grid and its inner workings in this last update, we believe you will find the gameplay more fluid now. We hope you can give us another try and we appreciate the positive rating! - Overloot Team It’s a really good game design. It’s very enjoyable and challenging and forces you to play fast and think fast. Unfortunately, as others have noted, once you hit around level 22ish the game difficulty more than doubles. To get daily rewards you have to do a lottt more than previously. The game introduces bombs that drop every 5-15 seconds on some enemies that destroy your weapons and armor. I thought by picking up the bomb and holding it in an area with no items it would be okay but that does not help at all. Items would just disappear randomly from my grid with me not being able to do anything. Enemies started almost 2-3 hitting me with green gear all around and it would be gone and I would get this flurry of attacks that drains alllll of my health after my gear was destroyed. It’s like they know you get invested around 20 or so and ramp the difficulty up a lot just so you get tired of losing and shovel cash into the game. I’ve played level 22 three times now and lose to the final enemy with bombs every 5 seconds and can’t do anything about it. Sorry, but this feels like a cash grab at this point. At first, this game is great, but the more you play the more you see why everyone gives it less stars. Tavern quest for collecting a certain amount of gold is too high, it keeps increasing throughout the day. My first day of playing the gold to finish the quest was like easy, finished it no problem, but day two of playing, I didn’t notice it until it was at around 8,000,000 and increased to 10,700,000 before the day was over and my 3rd day playing its like 20mil and I probably can only reach 1 or 2 million by playing daily. I think it increases every time I log in as if it added the next day’s quest amount. Power ups lag. I clicked whistle but still overlooted then after the video and the selling, the whistle was used and merchant came again. Ate food delivery still died, even though the animation and healing amount showed. This game could be great if it was smoother. I almost regret spending money on this game, just glad that these bugs showed themselves early before I spent more.

I love it that it helps give you glimpse what it was like for people during the time.  I also love you gave some glimpses of the phases of Operation Cobalt.  But there is a glitch for me (though I do not doubt others will have problems as well).  When I go to buy certain in-app purchases and watch an ad for temporary episode unlock, the app doesn’t pull up anything. As in I can’t buy anything because the menu won’t pop up, and neither will the ad.  Do you think you all could fix this (though I understand if you can’t as this is a four year game)? This game is awesome! Even though the TV show it's modeled after was absolutely horrendous - I mean how were they able to take an award winning recipe (TWD) and make the biggest piece of crap on TV (FEAR TWD)!? But that's another review I have to write on a different site. The gameplay is simple and the visual style totally complements the zombie apocalypse feel. I also like how scenes, characters, etc from the show were integrated seamlessly into the game. Unfortunately, all the in-game purchases that are required in order to progress through the story are so rediculously  expensive, it becomes very slow going very quickly and brings to the fore front the fact that the developers want to make as much money off you as possible, which kind of kills the whole thing. Great game but be ready to drop some cash or watch a crap load of commercials. I love this game, this concept, and especially the fact hat you can actually save survivors! But the big problem I referenced is the fact that when I win Episode 1, Season 1, it doesn’t unlock the next episode (not sure if it’s supposed to though), and when I try to watch an ad to use it for the next 24 hours, it doesn’t work! And, there isn’t even a way to pay money or something to unlock an episode!

That’s the idea that sparked a world-building phenomenon in Mojang’s amazing Minecraft. Since the game's release on the App Store, a steady stream of meaningful updates has kept this cube-filled universe fun, fresh, and jam-packed with exciting features. I enjoy this game till this day, if you knew like me what the nether reactor core and when you could glitch stack armour. It has changed so much and suddenly blew up out of know where! I have been creating boat racing maps, and almost everything I can imagine. If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it’s almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it’s perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it. Thank you! I’ve been playing Minecraft PE since 2011 and it’s awesome! But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let’s say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don’t know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it’s basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star’s second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can’t stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn’t do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.

The game is designed to make the developers money, its a business.  If your looking for a free game to play for 30 seconds several times a day, you are good to go on this one.  Want to play for longer, it’s going to cost you money.  50-60 spins to get a bonus game (free spins or pick feature) and 8 out of ten times you will get between 2 and 12 times your bet.  There are no rules or oversight for online casinos, so if you’re expecting the odds of winning to be the same as is real casinos you will be disappointed.  Read the privacy policies, they do collect your device ID, IP address, and purchase and play habits.  You push the spin button and then the results are sent to your device...you can see how that can be manipulated, despite their claims that all payouts are based on Vegas like algorithm.  Real casinos have gaming commissions to ensure slots are truly random within the algorithm.  No such requirement here, so don’t expect the same results. Hi! Sorry to hear about this. If you haven't done so, please get in touch with our Player Support Team http://zynga.my/GoTContactSupport so we can take a closer look. If possible, please include your Player ID.Thanks for your time and patience. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones than this slot is a must. Gorgeous graphics with music taken right from the show including the theme song. Each slot features different music form the show. Plus, the voice form the actual actors is used in each slot and you hear them frequently, even on small wins. Their lines taken from the show seem to be extensive as they are not repeated to often. You also have a ton of fun and interesting things to do like challenges, and joining a house to fight against other houses with rewards and exploring the map. Lots going on. Only negative, and it doesn’t take away for the game is the slots from Vegas are not here (like the original game of thrones), but that is to be expected since they are Aristocrat owned.Very enjoyable, just wish the coins were a little more generous (you can collect them every hour but you don’t get that much).Highly recommended, every fan will be very pleased with hearing their favorite lines from the show, music, etc. best slot on the market (and I play a lot of slot apps). Can’t recommend it enough. Positives: If I could give 5 stars to something in the game, it’s the graphics, they are amazing! Very cool and stunning visuals with intense music score. It is a fun game....When you actually win.  There are a lot of different options for games which you can switch off from, and keep changing it up. Negatives: Bonuses are hard to come by as are the small special features that randomly pop on the screen. It just does not keep it interesting when all you see is reels spinning every turn.  When you do get a bonus, especially one when you have to choose an icon to either uncover free spins or a bonus wheel, 90% of the time you will get the bonus wheel which usually does not pay much. The game flat out does not let you keep playing for an extended period of time or pay out to keep it fun. I honestly check in throughout the day to get my bonus coins, start playing at a low bet and will be done within 5 minutes. This does NOT keep the player interested or wanting to come back, and I am not paying money for millions of coins that could just dwindle to zero within a matter of minutes. Very frustrating. The pop ups that come on the top of the screen showing players that have won jackpots is also very annoying. I really don’t care about who won a jackpot every 5 seconds because it ruins the concentration and enjoyment I am trying to have on MY game. The developers need to do better. Hi Thank you for sharing your thoughts and ideas about our game, it is highly appreciated. Rest assured that we will take good note of this so we can improve our game to better our players' experience. Have a nice day.

It’s why I make games and specifically open worlds. I like exploring nature and using my imagination And I want others to have a place you can do the same. NimiAn Legends feels like it’s a real place to me in some ways and I am always trying to learn better ways to bring it to life. Right now I’m working on a new world that’s a lot larger and I hope to bring you an even more massive natural world to explore soon. Vandgels and BrightRidge are two places that have been in my head since I was a kid and it’s a lot of fun to finally see these characters in an actual game. Your spirited feedback and five star review also really support me. As you said I’m one person so I also am boosted when people say kind things and it means a lot to me that the experience meant something positive to you:) I will keep it up! First off let me start off by saying that this game is absolutely one of the most visually stunning games I’ve ever laid eyes on for a mobile game. I will say that the developer has shown great care and love to the scenery the characters in the story and some really great plot twists. I fully support your development of these games and of any future endeavors you might undertake. I will say that I am a person who does not write many reviews about games that I play because I play so many it’s not worth it for me, however coming across this title I knew that I had to speak up because I could absolutely tell the amount of effort put into this game. I have recently downloaded another title by this developer and look forward to checking it out as well. Thank you very much for putting the effort into this as you have. I am at a loss on the great reviews for this game.  Perhaps it does not work correctly with the newest ipads?  I am using an ipad pro with 256gb of storage, over half of which is free and I had no other programs open.  My experience with this and the prior Nimean game is that the controls are utterly horrible.  Camera swings about wildly when you try and move your character and constantly works in too close.  Changing control and view settings did not help.  Game does not seem to be designed for a touch screen and there is no onscreen joypad appearing even when I select that option.  Simply agonizing to try and make the character do anything.  Also, no audio speech, just a compressed squealy babble when characters talk - text does appear at the bottom of the screen but I tend to miss it - just weird as speech bubbles do appear most of the time when characters talk - however there are no words in the bubbles.  Also difficult to tell who is speaking and who they are speaking to due to camera jumping around and getting too close in.  There may be a great experience here, but I’ll never know it.  Life is too short. There are lots of great games out there that work properly - better to play one of those than struggle with this.  Oh well. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

Transforming your klutzy ninja into a capable combatant using a variety of objects—like trampolines and balloons—is an absolute joy. The easy-to-understand challenges make this an excellent choice for new gamers, and the incredible array of items and interactions ensures that experienced gamers are charmed silly. Hey developers and people who have or are thinking to download this game! I have been playing Clumsy Ninja a lot. I used to play it on my iPad but now I have it on my iPhone 7 Plus. This game is amazing! The graphics and animations are beautiful. The chicken and squirrel are so cute! Not only can you get animals that roam around, you can get different toys and training items! You can dress your ninja to give him style and even go to different places. This game is overall brilliant! I have only a few small suggestions. The first one is there is a small bug where the ninja will jump onto the bamboo trampoline and get glitched inside. Shortly after this happens, the ninja and trampoline fly into the air. This is only a minor bug and doesn’t interfere with the game much but just letting you know. The next thing is the XP gain. The XP gain is little too slow. Keep in mind I said a little. I don’t want you to change it to where I do one thing and level up. I’m only asking to increase it a little bit to where you still have to train with your ninja but you don’t have to constantly train over and over to get to the next level to finish a mission. This game is remarkable and amazing! I hope you read this and thank you! Hey! Just so you know, I LOVE this game! Every challenge, every photograph, every time the Chicken goes on my screen... But one of these challenges stood out to me. The “Face Yourself” Challenge. It requires “The Shadow” Punching bag with Sensei saying “Get The Shadow punch bag. It’s the dark, mysterious one...”Now if you are also a Sonic fan like me, doesn’t this sound like a Shadow the Hedgehog reference? Shadow the Hedgehog is dark and mysterious. The Shadow punch bag is in Shadow’s colors: black and red. Plus, Shadow is Sonic’s rival. At first, SEGA made it so almost every character in Sonic Adventure 2 thought Shadow was Sonic and that it was Sonic who stole the Chaos Emerald. Sonic calls him “faker” because Shadow almost looks exactly like him. And they almost equal in power, if not one of them has more. It was almost as if Sonic was facing himself...But hey, I’m just guessing a bit here. You are probably trying to describe a ninja being the punch bag. Or maybe you aren’t. Oh well, I still love this game anyway. Thanks for creating this!

Also In the vault you can delete items. I would like it to ask twice instead of once to delete an item because I accidentally deleted a very useful potion.

Other than that whole paragraph this game is great. You should try adding a hogsmeade. Thank You for taking your time to read my Review and I hope you take my suggestions into consideration.                           -Addicted Player I really enjoy playing this game...it’s fun, I enjoy the story line, picking a profession, and all that stuff.  However, there are a few things that I think would make the game significantly better.  1) It’s been said by many already—spell energy.  Can their be other ways to obtain this?  Specifically for people in rural areas where inns and greenhouse and few and far between.  Can we earn like 1 spell energy every 30 minutes or something?  It would be awesome to be able to wake up with a full energy bank each day, and would also make me want to play the game more frequently because I know that I could. 2) Can Masterful casts actually mean something?  It’s pretty stupid that a low level threat can resist a masterful cast.  What’s the point in trying to get a masterful cast if all you get is XP?  There is literally no other perk, as it doesn’t at all seem to affect your likelihood of capturing a foundable.  I have defeated a high level threat on a “good” cast, but had a low level threat depart after a masterful cast?  Seems stupid and pointless to have casting ability only count toward XP. 3) Storage.  I know this has been said by others as well, but it’s annoying to constantly have to delete ingredients/potions...particularly if you’re trying to stock up for a Wizard battle.  I realize this is to make people spend actual money buying coin to increase their storage, but it really makes me want to play the game less...not more. I agree that it’s a lot of fun for Harry Potter fans, and there are a lot of fun features. But in the American version, it’s hard to find inns unless they’re literally right there (within a mile) because you can’t zoom out on the map in game to find an inn nearby (I.e. within 5 mi) (and the online maps don’t work well either). I also don’t like that the game isn’t as intuitive as Pokémon Go—there’s a learning curve, and right now I’m not sure what I’m doing or how to work things. It would be nice if here was somewhere to go to review the storyline as well, because there’s a lot of moving pieces and it’s a little hard to follow. Also, the graphics are shoddy in some places (especially the people—Ginny was very slender in the movies, yet she looks overweight in the graphics, Luna is only recognizable because she’s he only one that wears that hat, Neville does not look all there, etc.). and the profile pictures will update on our personal app, but our friends can’t see it (my husband and I play together, and we will have to show each other our phones to show each other our profile pics). I realize it’s like this in Pokémon Go too, but I also don’t like that you would regularly have to travel to different countries to get everything (e.g. that awesome opal eye dragon in about a week). So you would have to be incredibly rich to get everything. BUT there’s a lot to do and explore, and I am mostly having fun with it. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

Every person you meet, every thing you purchase—and even what you choose to pack—has an impact on your trip and can lead to a victorious journey or an utter failure. Inkle Studios’ beautiful creation is stitched together with wonderful typography, gorgeous music, and a story you’ll return to time and time again. I am a video game tester and in my free time I like to test out mobile games. I have been so addicted to this game for a long time, after a while it does get boring. But this game is still great, if you are looking to read something and have an interactive adventure at the same time, this game is perfect for you. This game might even be educational on some levels. If you want an action packed thriller of an adventure, the money this costs will not go to waste. The reason I am leaving a four star and not a five is because at times the game can get annoying, and that can make it fun. It was all realistic just like the movie until, I got lost on ice and kidnapped by mermaids and I lost the game because of that. Overall the game is spectacular, 4/5. I'm not much of a game player but I was going on a trip, so I googled games and this one came up as one of the most popular, best games, so I got it. I have gone around the world now four times, and each time I learned some new things about the planet, different countries, oceans, cities, etc. I had to look up cities and countries on maps. We died once at the North Pole because we thought it would be brilliant to make the smallest circumference; another time we  didn't intend to go there but made a navigation mistake and almost died but were rescued and made it around the world in 64 or 65 days. On another trip we were a few days late and lost the wager. We went around the world again and made it in about 74 days.  I've learned that when the valet makes the wisest, less reckless decisions, we do better. If he picks up something not his, he suffers the consequences. If he goes for an evening walk, he might gather useful information or he might get pick-pocketed or arrested. Take notes, useful for other trips. Buy maps at new markets so you get more routes, then sell them.  Take care of Monsieur Fogg. Buy items at markets that you can later sell. Occasionally earn extra money doing chores at your hotel.  Make friends. Make sure you have enough money by visiting banks. New York to London by airship is a good route. Engage in conversations and read the news occasionally.   Love and compassion usually have good outcomes. This is a great game. 5 stars.

I do love this game a lot! But...a lot of the items on here are locked and I do not want to buy the full package. Maybe you could make some more of the items free. And when u are dressing up the groom and bride you can only watch one add for one of the items which means we would have to choose what we want. Cause what if we wanted both the lipstick and the eyelashes. And when u watch the add for the bride on the groom u can only have 2 choices hair, and facial hair. In my opinion I do not like facial hair. So if you are reading this please consider doing the things I have noted. I have only done about 6 wedding and it was very difficult to make them look decent with the little choices of dresses, hair, pants, etc. I also do not like how u have to watch adds in order to get the items. I know u want to advertise different games of yours but just make some more items unlocked. Please consider making some more items free and unlocked. Thank you for reading this whole thing I know it’s kinda long. Let me begin by saying that this app is by far one of the best free apps to offer what it does. However the fact that you guys are promoting that you have fixed the bugs on this app is a bit misleading given the fact that you have not. I was able to get through about 24 weddings and I am now unable to continue due to the same screen coming up even when I close out and reboot the app. It’s also unfortunate that you guys have us watch so many adds when the only things you offer as rewards should already be apart of the dressing options. As a business owner I understand the demand and promotion for paying further into the app but you guys are a bit over priced for what you’re offering. In conclusion I actually really enjoyed this game and the only tips I have for the wonderful people who created this app are as follows l: 1. More color coded free options with matching attire 2. There shouldn’t be more shorter hairstyles than longer given the fact that we are dealing with brides. 3. There should be matching attire items for each outfit chosen for the groom and bride and the bridesmaids and groomsmen to match accordingly. 4. Consider setting up adds to offer some of the things you are asking us to pay for, it supports the player to want to purchase further into what you are selling if they could at least try the locked outfits on. No further tips at this time. Thank you for the idea and the app that you have put out.       Best Regards, Brown Cosmetics Hey there,Thanks a lot for your helpful feedback. We're constantly working on making our game the best it could be!If you have any issues, please contact us at support@tabtale.com and we'll do our best to assist you.Thanks for playing!Dream Wedding Planner Team So i got this Game and it was so fun!! Until the thing I dread the most happened an add. Now I thought this was just a one time thing I mean don’t get me wrong I did watch adds to get stuff but this add came without me clicking a “ watch ad” icon. Then more and more came till my screen just went black I clicked my ho e button and then clicked the game again and guess what ..... it was still black. Anyways so I cleared my history and it worked but anytime an ad pops up the same things happen. Now I don’t know if it is just my device glitching or something else. Another thing is that the Ads are sometimes inappropriate and I don’t like I don’t know if y’all can change there being less ads but at least choose appropriate ones. Anyways but other than that it’s a great game I also have a suggestion you should have a thing to where you can dress your character. So yeah please fix thread situation and have a great day!

I just have a few small issues. Missions where you have to defend the generator are pretty tough on legendary. Elites shred through its health, making groups of elites horrifying when you’re low on ammo. When I try to leave to get some extra ammo, I have to watch the generator’s health vanish in those quick seconds. The only other issue I have is the shotgun on higher difficulties. Using it for any boss or brute groups is a bit of a suicide mission due to its range and damage. While it works wonders on groups of jackals and grunts, trying to use it on bosses makes the gun pretty underwhelming. Besides that, everything else is great, especially with those Reach helmets! Some Reach shoulder pads would definitely be worth grinding for too... After playing this game for about a week, my opinion on this game is...meh. Some of the gameplay doesn't make sense such as you're not able to shoot at someone at point blank range, instead hitting them with your weapon/fist. Why couldn't these things be separate? Also why is that we're only able to aim straight forward instead of in different directions? Another thing that doesn't make sense to me is the pvp game modes are the only multiplayer game modes. Why can't firefight and missions have multiplayer as well? And the amount of grind you have to put into this game is just ridiculous. It's just as bad as grinding in Warface on pc and Xbox in my opinion. Leveling up is a pain because of how long it takes to level up. These are my only gripes with the game. Besides all of what I've said, it's an enjoyable (and kinda annoying) game to the point to where I can respect it. P.S. I saw a previous review that someone has posted saying that this game is suitable for all Halo players or something along those lines. This game is NOT suitable for all Halo players. Maybe suitable to those who have played games similar to this one and enjoy playing games like this, but not to those who mainly play the main games and maybe a few fan games here and there (excluding this one). The game is fun. And I’m glad that you have the option to play offline! The controls are a little funky. Crouching and descending is sort of an issue. I think that you should be able to slowly hover down if you hold the jump button just like how you can hover in Halo 5. This next thing is not a necessity but maybe play around with it... maybe add a up and down aiming mechanic? But you should add the ability to run backwards and shot by sliding the shoot button unless if you think that would be too overpowered (to even make this possible you would have to change the shoot button into a joystick). Definitely make the maps bigger! That is one of the biggest problems! Upgrading weapons requires more work than it should and you should add a weapon point system so that we can choose which stat of the weapon to upgrade. The Magnum (or pistol) is WAY too weak!!! Definitely buff it! Please add Prometheans to the game and make them have more health than the other enemies (because they have more health than the other enemies in the real game). Please try to add some or maybe even all of these suggestions to the game. Keep up the good work!

Spectacular visuals and spellbinding music bolster an epic tale that pits you—one of Earth’s few survivors—against the monsters who stole our homeworld. Fighting in your War-Mech battle suit’s a blast, with legions of ghastly foes ready for your lethal sword and fearsome firepower. If you like games long on style and ambition, this one’s for you.  I don't really know where to begin with this one. I'd have to say that this is the best--ever--game in the App Store. I was hooked from the minute the intro came on and from just that I knew it'd be awesome. I don't commonly write reviews(this is my third), but I felt like my reaction to this had to be shared. It was hard to see how a game could be even considered with a ten dollar price tag slapped on it, yet surprisingly I felt relieved I spent so much. Well, not that I spent so much, but rather what I got was beyond satisfactory. All of the RPG apps out there, as fun as they are, find it difficult to compete with this. Graphics are phenomenal and there's no lag, at least not on my device. The controls are perfect for mobile, and there's a ton of moves and upgrades to use(but not so many it doesn't distract you from the action). Yes, and the action! Nonstop yet diverse with each level--perfectly balances the story and combat. So if you're like me and can't make up your mind for your life, I recommend this game to you, and I promise...it's worth every penny. I mean, it's about a human-operated robot with a sword and laser gun fighting mechanically enhanced mutants in a dystopian future. What more could you ask for? I don’t get the pricing strategy RELATIVE to other games in the genre/App Store. That being said, I’ll drop 10 bucks on my way home from work on a pack of craft beer; I’d rather spend money on a quality game than have the alternative: ads, IAPs, money grabs, and $99 pack of ‘gems’, so thank you for that. It seems to me like a price more in line with competitors would allow this game to stay relevant in the marketplace longer, but I’m sure there’s a strategy behind all that somewhere in the business model: or they love their own creation too much to price according to others in the App Store. (Again, I don’t normally play free games, I like getting a self-contained game and gladly pay for it).  Pricing strategy aside, PLEASE update so the game fits my iPhone X screen before I beat it! The controls can be frustrating when you’ve learned how a boss moves and trying to get out of the way before a planned attack: mostly because my left thumb slides off the small format game area (iPhone X) and the player just stands there and gets hit. But there’s a learning curve to it (again, still giving 5 stars)If you like hack n slash/ level up games; I would recommend adding this one to your collection. Thanks team! Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

They were right......... so unless you want to be ripped off don’t spend your money. There’s a reason they want u to pay before u can try it out....... so they can steal your money.  Thief’s..............I can’t stand one, especially since I have spent hundreds if not thousands of money with big fish....they should be ashamed and banned from store. This game doesn’t work on iPhone X. I didn’t even get to start it. I watched the intro, when it was time to type in player’s name, you can’t type. Tapping any part of the screen, has no action. I deleted it and reinstalled. This time, once the intro started, I tried to tap skip, and again it resulted in no action. The entire intro played and again, I still couldn’t entire player’s name, or go any further. I won’t purchase from them again.

Explore vivid forests, bright landscapes, and the shell of a high-tech society overgrown by nature as you seek to cure a fatal illness. Packing silky smooth, lightning-fast combat, Hyper Light Drifter is a blast—even when you’re just admiring the scenery. First off, fantastic game! I love playing this. Awesome storyline and reaches back to my younger years of playing Zelda etc. I play it on IPad and yes I also wish the controls were easier cause you can’t get the dash room achievements at all with IPad control system. Here’s the thing that happened. In the southern zone, the one module room that turns out to be a fake module and then you have to fight a mini boss. So as I have understood, it is still a module right? Cause after I defeat it you go to the next room and then pull the real module. But on my map the fake mod is still highlighted pink and I still haven’t been able to find the eighth module. I have looked all over and tried to reasearch the maps but it always points me back to the fake room. Is this a bug? Should I make a new game and try again? I also noticed something that happened when I equipped the Tanuki sword once I attained it, there would be an error window popping up and the game shuts down. Now all that is said, these are all things that I’m sure starting a new game will hopefully fix but I wanted you to know about it. I am a really big fan of this game cause it’s just too much fun. It’s nice to play something that actually feels like a real game with substance and it looks like real love was put into the making of it. Cheers! This game is amazing! So much fun and very rewarding! Only thing that needs to be done is the ability to remap buttons. Certain upgraded attacks are too hard to do in combat because my thumb is controlling movement and I have to hit two buttons at the same time to do dash attack. I’m sure it’ll be taken care of! Thank you for this amazing game! Best purchase in along time!!! Additional feedback... So I’ve been trying to collect everything before I beat my first play through of the game and I went ahead and researched where the outfits were *slight spoiler I guess* and I see that one of the outfits is locked until you can get 800 consecutive dashes in the dash arena... I’ve had a great time with the touch controls but I’m not gonna lie it kinda is disappointing that I will never get that outfit because it’s actually impossible to achieve 50 consecutive dashes with a touch screen let alone 800 lol. I hope you guys can add some kind of compromise so we can unlock the outfit! I understand this could have been missed in hindsight sense it’s much more achievable with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. Here’s to being hopeful that I can unlock everything!! Thanks again!

I’ve passed all the levels and got all the stars. I was so obsessed with this game until I finished all levels. I ended up deleting it after going through all levels a second time. This game is my favorite ever and I would love a Silly Walks 2! Please take my advice because I think a lot of other people would like this too! Maybe you could use some things from the first one too and add more characters to choose from. Also, I love this game but on the first Silly Walks I had a hard time beating the bosses. Maybe make them easier or take them out if you make another Silly Walks. I ended up getting through the bosses after a while though but if you make it easier it would be less time. Another thing that you could do differently is maybe adding more levels because of how addicting this game is! I was so addicting I didn’t play anything else and I got through the whole game very quickly so more levels would be great! Thanks so much and I love your work!🤗❤️ I was looking forward to playing the app Silly Walks as it was on the app stores front page. I downloaded the app and thought it was great well, at first. The app was great then I go onto the next level the second level. It was too hard for me of course it may not be hard for anyone else but it was too hard for me I couldn’t get past the waffle iron without getting burned. I tried to dashing. That wouldn’t work! Just a little hard – at least for me.Second thing. I was looking forward to this super cute little foods. I thought oh maybe if I get more foods would be easier for me to get pass through certain levels. But when I tried every single watch your video to get this fruit food. Nothing helped! And out was a tip to if you look at the app. So I do you spend a lot of time watching stupid videos that are pointless. The cubes are very hard to get in my opinion. Please make it easier to get cubes or new characters. If you are actually reading this please respond! I’d love to hear your response but overall I think that is OK. Just please fix this. This game really is a little gem I didn’t know what the gameplay was going to be like as I just downloaded 3 games at once to play while sitting in the car pool to pick up my brother and this game totally surprised me! It’s simple but fun, The art style and characters are stylized food items and the hazards are different kitchen utensils. Each level revolves around breaking your food friends out of a cage at the end of the level. New hazards are introduced at a steady pace and there’s even short cinematic’s for new bosses and items. Really glad I downloaded this game, the ads are evenly spaced and are about 20 seconds each but set further apart than most games. The characters are easily unlockable and there’s even a mini game that’s a racing game. Definitely give this game a try if you’re looking for a simple but fun and interesting puzzle-ish game.

Me personally I like jump scares, so that’s why I think this game is so fun! But there is also other reasons why I think it’s a great game! I like that u have to find her purse, keys, and other stuff! What I think is annoying is that when u want to pause the game u have to listen to a ad, And whenever u die you have to listen to an ad. I also don’t like is right when you walk into her house she’s right there! I never get to Rome around her house. I think that you should add that when she’s following you, after a while she stops and walks away. And you should be able to go into other peoples houses. But otherwise it’s a great game! It is lonely in the neighborhood so please add more characters. One could be lawn mowing? This game is great but not going into other houses? Please make the player and granny go into the lakes. When holidays have come please decorate the neighborhood. Please make the player be able to go into other houses and barns.

The tale begins as Professor Layton, a true English gentleman and famous archeologist, drives to the remote settlement of St. Mystere with his apprentice, Luke, in response to a request from the widow of a wealthy baron. The baron’s will indicates that the family treasure, the Golden Apple, is hidden somewhere within the village, and whoever finds it will inherit the whole of the Reinhold Estate.

Finally that day has come! This game may seem pretty expensive at $10, but if your a puzzle fan like myself then its well worth the money. The game is almost identical to how I remember it on the DS, aside from a few additions from the developers (all good btw). I only have two requests to make. 1) That after finishing the story, the remaining puzzles be moved the house; i’ve finished the story but am missing a few of the puzzles and don't know where to find them. 2) I’ve collected several (not all) of the puzzle solving charms, but i’m still not sure what they do, or if there just a new collectable thing for fun, which is fine if they are. Could there be some more description for them? Aside from that the game is awesome and I love playing it. Also, I don't recall if the weakly puzzles section was on the DS or not but I also really like that and if its new then I think its a great addition to the game (but save some puzzles for the next game 😉). Again, great game and well worth it!!! Alright I’m gonna be real - Professor Layton is one of the best video games ever for those that love brain teasers and FANTASTIC plot and storyline. Sometimes the riddles are easy af and sometimes I’m stuck for three days. The music is wonderful - MUST BE LISTENED WITH EARBUDS OR YOU WONT HEAR IT - but once you pop those earbuds in it takes me back. I really enjoy the way the game has been adapted to fit the iPhone screen. They stayed true to the original for graphics, storyline, play, and the split screen divider. Absolutely worth the 10 bucks and I will love this game forever. Thank you for making it into an app! Should you do more I will 100% buy all the installments. Thanks for creating this!!! This is a tentative review since I just started playing yesterday; if I get a significantly different impression with more play I’ll update again later. Lovely graphics, pretty slow-paced so far (story-based, which is fine, but I’m not finding the story all that interesting yet and I think the player is supposed to identify with the assistant but I’m just not feeling it), puzzles not that good so far, maybe better for children than adults. I’m extremely annoyed that the game doesn’t automatically save progress unless you click on the suitcase, when I opened the game today I’d lost all my progress from yesterday and had to start over. Overall plays more like a gaming station video game than a mobile app — i get the impression it’s intended for longer sessions, and again it doesn’t automatically save progress.

After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest Classic with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game. You're called to the northern port of Seversk in deep winter to join the Tzar, his militia and navy for a final assault on the fortress of Kozney the Deathless.  Kozney has new allies, elves and dwarf blacksmiths, as well as the spirits of his mighty, cunning dragons to back him up. Enjoy one of Argimon's trickiest dungeons yet and learn Silvergirl's deathless secret. New monsters, new spells, roughly 60 quests will take you throughout a beautiful land, including a mysterious island, to the ocean floor and to the Underworld. To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select ""The Deathless"" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 45 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion. The Quest Classic - Hero of Lukomorye IV has been developed by Zarista Games (www.catacomber.com) and was adapted to iPhone by Redshift.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/8c/5b/b1/8c5bb144-a07f-29d3-64f6-8268d867b9a4/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-85-220-1.png/1200x630wa.png,,5.0 • 2 Ratings,$2.99,,"February 22, 2018","I'm a huge fan, and this is another challenging, entertaining and immersive chapter in the story. If you're familiar with this expansion on PC/Palm OS, this has been expanded from the original, so it's totally worth getting it again :). If you're new to the series, this works as a standalone game; as well as a further chapter in the series. The artwork is gorgeous, the creatures are amazing, and the game is played from your character's point of view, so you can get caught up in it. If you're a fan of role-playing games, you get the monsters, the weapons, and the epic battles. If you like something more cerebral, there are brain-twisting riddles, witty dialogue, and opportunities to craft a strategy. Game is absolutely amazing and for some reason looks better to me than the other quest games (textures seem to look more clear). The only rhing i disliked with all the quest games (i own all 8) is the stupid sicknesses. Please for the love of god add an option to turn them off and on. Zarista games keeps outdoing themselves with every new expansion to the quest. This one is by far the best yet. Great replayability too. The quests are challenging enough that you can play several times and still find it tough each time ","The Quest Classic - HOL IV, Redshift, Games, Role Playing, Entertainment, Adventure, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

It takes something simple, like burning stuff for fun and making it into something more then just burning stuff. The combos keeps you going and brainstorming on what the riddles mean, the items you burn are not only bizarre but makes you curious on what they do, and if that’s not enough; the little story behind it with this girl name Sugar Plumps, will make your heart beat for this game, and the incredible music makes it perfect. Even after 6 years since its release, it stands against time where its still fun and gets the inspirational message across with its story. I hope the developers consider making a sequel to this game, with more wacky combos, items and another great story that would make you melt with the game. (Pun intended lol). If you’re thinking about playing this game or not for sure what game to play next, I highly consider playing this game, it’s really worth the money. When I first started playing this game it was ok, I was burning stuff earning money so I thought of it as the game that lighten me up when I bored (see what I did there lol anyway) but when I met sugar plumps there was a story I never knew about and it was awesome and then it went to the crisis I thought it was over and left on my iPad not even realizing it (mainly because I can't know anymore combos lol)but then after I got back on to it, it was almost to the end. When I reached to the end it was magical and inspirational making you feel like there is another then just playing video games because I'm telling you it will be the most awesome experience you will ever feel, so please get this game... This game is one of the greatest titles I've ever had the honor to experience. Some may wonder how a game about burning junk in a fireplace is any fun, but they'll not be disappointed by this utter masterpiece in gaming. I've played and beaten World of Goo (also wonderful to play) and this game gives me a lot of nostalgia from that game. This game is also challenging to take in. It's a satirical work of art that represents gamers' tendencies to be cut off from society and be enthralled by some that burns up money. While I do wish the ending could've told wether the boy found Sugar Plumps, I love the game and it'll hold a special place in my heart.

It's nice to have a game I can complete and feel satisfied with. I recommend to anyone who like point and click games. Hoping for a sequel! Hi crossfire2200, thanks for your feedback. Naturally the length of time people take to get through the story varies depending on how long it takes them to solve the puzzles, but we do acknowledge that the biggest criticism of the game people have stated is its length. We like to think that we went for quality over quantity, for example every line of dialogue is hand animated, something you wouldn't see in AAA video game let alone one developed by a very small indie studio like ourselves (it was pretty much a team of 4 of us that worked on this for 3 years). These kinds of games are actually very expensive to make, which is why you don’t typically see too many 3D point and click adventures games nowadays (beyond a very small handful of large developers such as Telltale like you mentioned). Anyway, felt I should reply to your review to answer your criticism, the hope is very much that if the game makes enough money that we will be able to create a second, longer sequel. Thank you.

But what makes it a great game is the feeling of something original and fun. It goes towards the very basics of turn based gaming and is a roam type game which makes it even better. I had this game on a different account which was level 128, and now I’m starting over cause I lost my old phone... but never mind that. If you’re looking for a great game look no further. U may see people complaining about the energy system or “pay to win” but this is neither of those. It has the option to buy things in the game, but honestly they don’t really help you. More of just a boost for an hour or two. And the energy, a lot of games use this to keep players from becoming super good within the first 45 minutes. This is purely so you don’t get bored and delete the game. This is a super fun game I honestly would recommend it to anyone who likes classical games. And don’t worry, the game is just like the video, no ripoff there 🥴 The featured review talks about how if there wasn’t an energy limit you could just grind easily and get a ton of familiars except artificially increasing the length of a game is the biggest pay to win gimmick ever. The game is lazily made. I don’t mind the game itself but everytime I try and get a familiar it fails unless you bribe it with super hard to get gems. It takes ridiculous amounts of items just to upgrade one rare piece of equipment. You have to watch adds to get the rare gear because it’s the only way you’ll even survive. Most of it is pay to win. There isn’t even a story! You could add a story that would take an hour to a week to write at most and essentially double the time without putting on an energy limit but that’s not going to happen because energy is how they make their money. The main way anyway. Oh, and the reason you have to grind for familiars is because of how rare they are even though they aren’t that useful they’re treated like gems and the game constantly rubs it in if you don’t have a full team of them. After the first two guaranteed familiars I completed the first map and guess what. I only got two familiar offers and they both failed when I tried to persuade them which by the way costs 1k gold and is rigged with a low success chance of about 40%. You can’t repeat levels, only dungeons and I never got another familiar offer from a repeated dungeon. It’s annoying, requires grinding, and get’s pretty boring when you add it all together. Let me fist start off by saying i really like the game The artwork The mechanics it all blends nice and well but what really makes this game frustratingly fun is the fact that you will find your self in pointless dungeon and grinding hours and hours just for a pice of loot or a ruin or other things you need to build up your character so he or her can become stronger and not die all the time like it happens to me but what’s really sad is the Energy is absolutely dreadful look I understand that the developers don’t want you wasting your time on a game but at the same time players like myself are really competitive and will stop at nothing until I achieve what ever my goal may be wither that be a ruin or a pice of armor you see what I’m saying I could go on about how much was promised but sooo little was given in return I really enjoy this game I do but it seems to me that the dungeons are really repetitive I almost feel bad for calling in other people to do my job for me I hope that both you there person that reads this and the developers that made this game takes the time to read this and get a little understanding of what people like have to deal with when it comes to bit hero’s so please all I ask of you developers is FIX YOUR GAME!!

Pretty good if it was not gonna lie. It’s a good game, but their are some bugs and tweaks. The camp is lazy and basic, they could add more stuff, like pictures and, maps. Next, the amount of bears is too much, I wast all my ammunition because of bears. Also, the “forest” has no trees and it’s more like plains, with little trees. They should make it so you can see the whole map, instead of a mini-map. Also, they should add other weapons, like an axe, tracking guns, snipers, and shotguns, also add like a swamp, or a river, to make it seem more realistic. And a lot of other tweaks with the glitchie graphics especially with the animals and Bigfoot. Lastly I know everyone already said this, but NO ADS, either give ads after or before the game, or add in skins and bonus upgrades like 2x more ammunition or something. Now I know I made this game sound bad, but it is good. The shooting of the rifle is good, the idea of adding the other animals and getting the meat for the traps is good and the looking at the cameras it looks like a real camera and I love the multiplayer feature and the scare in this game is good even now the Bigfoot noise makes me jump xD. Also how you added different locations and a lot more. I could go on all day about how they could improve this game and how it is good. Overall it’s a pretty good game. Well done. I really like this game and play it with my friend all the time. I have a couple suggestions. First: I wish you were able to have settings and make it so that there isn’t a bear chasing after you every freaking two seconds, because there are just so many bears it’s unrealistic. Second: This game needs some bug fixes. Some times when my friend and I are about to kill Bigfoot, he will turn into just two red eyes and you can’t even shoot him. This glitch is so freaking annoying. Please fix it. And last, I think you should add more guns and skins. For the guns, I was thinking maybe a sniper and a pistol. And it takes too many shots to kill a bear. I think a headshot or two body shots should kill it.Thank you for reading this.

It’s the best thing for when I’m backstage with my friends, having a sleepover or when I’m hanging out with someone and we can’t figure out what to do. Although sometimes there’s always someone who NEVER gets a turn and someone who gets a turn all the time. If u have a way to fix that, that would be great!!! I also love how u can put in ur own truths and ur own dares. Me and my stage friends always get bored before a play and we often get loud and restless. Then I suggest the game and we played. Then next I know everyone is playing with us, even the ones I don’t talk to often. It’s just that fun! So thank u! And if u could fix the problem with not everyone getting enough turns that would be great thanks!!! I’m addicted! It’s awesome! Just one recommendation, spell everything better. I couldn’t understand 3 of the dares because they were spelled wrong. It’s soooo awesome though! I love how you can make your own truths and dares, choose between kid, teen and adult, and choose spin the bottle, random selection or auto turn mode! (Auto turn means just going in order, so, each person just goes one after another.) Some of the dares are gross (smell dirty socks, lick someone’s foot, and brush someone else’s teeth.) but it still was fun. I love this game and I hope you take my recommendation.

When I’m bored I just go on my iPhone and play this game because I love the way I control the ball and unlocking new balls and vortex’s (Hope you make more!! 😃😃😍). I mean I know the ads can be annoying sometimes but it’s every free game not your fault. But I do have a tip to improve your rating. Just make the game a little more challenging and creative or even add some holiday features like  Christmas or Halloween and more (by the way Happy New Year 😛😉). But overall I adore this game and I think all the people who deleted the game and put bad reviews is mostly the ads but that’s what every free game does and hope they realize it. I recommend this game 👌🏻👌🏻🔥🔥 and hope you can improve to 5 star!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Edit: Another tip I forgot is add music!! Thanks!! Although this is a really well animated app there are a lot of adds. If you are thinking about downloading this app you should because you might think differently, but at first when I started playing there were not that many but as I got further into the game there got to be more and more pop up adds. Also, you can collect these crystals on the way down but sometimes they are the same color as the obstacles so, if you are going fast it is hard to tell the difference. One positive I would give on this app is that the animations are awesome and you can tell they put a lot of work into the game. You can also customize so many things. Some people say that the phone vibrating effects the game, but I found that it made it more enjoyable. It is not so extravagant that it moves my hand personally, but it could affect others. Also you can turn the vibration off if it really bothers you so it is not much of a problem. Sometimes when playing I also die for no apparent reason. I will be completely clear of obstacles which was extremely frustrating. The one thing that would make this app WAY more enjoyable is if there were less adds. On my phone there are seriously 2-3 adds per round which adds up since the rounds can be pretty short. You can remove them for 3 dollars but I am one who does not like to spend money on apps. This is is fun!! Not going to lie but I feel like the part that makes it hard for some people is the fact that it vibrates every time you go through a vortex, this makes my hand shake causing me to die😤. I feel like they did this on purpose so you watch more adds (which is how they get their money). So, it’s really hard to go through small openings especially with the constant buzzing breaking your concentration. So, I would give this 5 stars, but the buzzing just ruins it. GREAT JOB VOODOO (I’m being sarcastic if you can’t tell). All I’m asking us for them to take the buzzing out so you can easily play the game. PLEASE!!!!!!! For the sake of people being able to keep their hand(s) steady while playing this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please don’t ignore my review Voodoo, I’m doing this so you can improve your game and make it more playable 😛😛😛. However, I do like the different balls and vortex’s they have, it makes the game more interesting!!! 🤗 So, if you were thinking of getting this game, I wouldn’t tell you not too! It’s fun and amusing, just be aware it’s hard to keep your hand steady and could give you a headache (remember, it’s make your phone buzz). I hope that Voodoo fixes the buzzing issue and maybe I’ll consider playing this game more 😝😋🙂👍🏼 ","Rolly Vortex, Voodoo, Games, Adventure, Casual, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"
