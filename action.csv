So first off, nice game! Easy controls, idle feeling, a very good game to play while you are winding down in bed! As a bunch of people have said, there are **WAY TOO MANY ADS** üôÑüòíI will get so bored of an ad pop up, I‚Äôll go play something else. It‚Äôs a very easily addictive game once you remove at least half the ads. I have no idea if you recently updated it so that the group will jump/move fast or the castle thing but I like it!üòç Really peaked my interest! However, seems pointless. Why build a castle when you are never defending it or something! As well as the ‚Äúopponents‚Äù names, we all know it‚Äôs a computer. üòñAll in all, it is a VERY good game! I already enjoy the graphics, the gameplay, and the whole vibe and I‚Äôm excited to see what you have in store for this app! üî•üî• Love the game it‚Äôs great it‚Äôs amazing beautiful masterpiece the thing you‚Äôve created. BUT the ads are just a little too common and secondly when I say no thanks to watching an ad so I can get a bigger prize at the end of a round that last thing I would have expected, was an ad after I said no to an ad if I wanted to see one at that moment I would‚Äôve pressed the button for the extra coins. Now I understand that ads is how you make money and you gotta hustle, but I think we both know that the dominant is the enjoyment of the games users so please lower the ad count and maybe new people or former users can cone back since there are fewer ads and make up for the revenue loss of decreasing the ad rate. So please just take a moment to understand where we‚Äôre coming from This game is great for killing time, winding down, etc.  easy controls, idle feeling, and simplistic too, but that simplicity feels a bit low effort for the amount of money spent on advertising this very game.  And once you download this game, there is not near enough to this game to justify the amount of ads it has.  Frustrates me and bores me to the point that with too many long ads, I‚Äôll play something else.  Good idea, but low effort for what they do with whatever ad money they make.  Also, it will ask if I want to watch an ad to get a bigger reward.  I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúNo Thanks.‚Äù  TOO BAD watch an ad anyway, but with only the original reward.  That right there is the easiest way to get your game uninstalled.  But it seems to have gotten better about that for now.

I wanted a cheap alternative to Minecraft. But, honestly, don‚Äôt cheap out and buy this one. After my experience with this demo it really doesn‚Äôt appeal to the audience of Minecraft. It doesn‚Äôt have the expectations Minecraft does. I can understand that Microsoft is a big company and can push updates regularly, and come up with many unique things in their game like the Nether, the marketplace with community created maps, behavior packs, music, texture packs and so much more! For a couple extra dollars, you can have an overall better experience. Don‚Äôt cheap out on this game, it just isn‚Äôt really worth it compared to its competitor. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a direct ripoff, either. I would rather label it as ‚Äúinspiration.‚Äù Now I‚Äôve played most god these games and I love them, but I‚Äôm gonna suggest some more things to enhance the game.Try to add ruined military operations from the USSR and the US, like adding tanks, destroyers (RARE), and (LEGENDARY) an bomber or jet fighter, I know this is kinda modern but it adds a lot of history of what might of happened on a area.(Add submarines if possible too please) And also add more guns, like a AA turret to get rid of NPC fighters, (this is rare and they might take you to a somehow operational base, unless they think ur hostile, (don‚Äôt hold a weapon) and also add MG guns and old WWII rifles and assault rifles, this will enhance how much u can use to defend a area.Last suggestion : add NPC soldiers, boats, and planes. And a radio, also some medical equipment. This will give a challenge if they are allies with you and they could help you out somehow. But be warned, some will be hostile if you hold a weapon. Unless they already met you and know ur safe. And I‚Äôm done with the ideas. But dev if your reading this thank you for creating these games and I hope you take my ideas, I also hope it‚Äôs not too much for the game and too much to ask. So I love this could you add flint & steel and steel armor also add s a shield and iron gold diamond netherite and add enchanted books anvils and a portal that leads to the nether and another that leads to the enter dragon and add seed for it and add it to where it is not very hard add a tutorial when you are new to the game from building a house or a camp site on survival and add a bell and villages and more furniture like a switch that connects to a nearest lamp and add lamps to the game Like the one in the actual Minecraft that‚Äôs not copy right make your own bell that‚Äôs way different from the bell Actual bell that‚Äôs cool and add five nights at freddys and servers and multi player where you click play it has worlds friends servers multiplayer worlds.

First of all, The coins mechanic is broken. When I booted up the game I looked at the classes and decided on being a stealth/sniper, so I wanted the recon and invisible class, and a good sniper and maybe a melee weapon. This is unattainable without dozens of hours of work, and it took me (I counted) 63 full games to get the invisible class, (pretty low level.) FIX THIS! It should take a maximum of 25 games to get 1,000 coins and get a low level class. Still a lot, not the 80-90 that it is now. The only other flaw I saw in this game was the maps, which are made out of very basic slabs of grey and black and white, with ought any curves or design or anything. Make them better, and THEN I will spend money on your game. I really like this game but it is really starting to get on my nerves. First it is impossible to get money. In a good game I‚Äôll get 20 coins, and some guns cost 9000. Thats about 450 good games. Second the guns are rip offs. The default AR is better than half of the paid for guns, and the 900 dollar pump shotgun is ok. Having the 900 dollar one, I grinded for the 3400 tactical one... I have never used a worse gun. It does 28 damage... 28!!!!! And all you get in return is 2 more ammo and a slightly faster firing gun. I spent hours of my life for something that could barely kill a worm. Furthermore, 80% of the time I‚Äôll shoot someone and the damage will only be counted hours later, while I‚Äôm dead. Then the other 20% of the time it won‚Äôt do any damage. I‚Äôll be shooting someone with my rip-off gun and they‚Äôll just be standing there doing nothing. Also that ripoff gun I purchased can only be used for one character... one!!!! Speaking of characters, you give zero information on them. Now the only way I‚Äôll choose who to get is based on whether or not they look cool. The only reason this isn‚Äôt a zero star review is because I love the consent and overall game. But things need to be fixed. I love MilkChoco and I love the new stuff added to the game, but there‚Äôs some stuff I can‚Äôt ignore, starting with;The Blade Skill: It does WAY too much damage and is almost unreactable. Most classes can‚Äôt take it at full HP and the tankier classes are crippled by it. I would love it if you lowered the damage output since it‚Äôs really annoying to deal with.2: Skill balancing in general: While the blade skill is overpowered, the Myocat skill is underpowered. It only does 130 and while that‚Äôs a lot, every class in the game can take that kinda damage and this is a game where most of the weapons you‚Äôll have are guns. If I have to go close range with a signature skill, I want it to be worth it. Either buff Myocat skill or change it to be a support skill or a different type of offense. 3: Connection. Even on my strongest internet, the game still lags a lot and I can sometimes can‚Äôt log in.4: Coins. You‚Äôve heard this a lot before, so I‚Äôll keep it brief. With the newer guns and classes being more expensive, MilkChoco veterans like me have to grind for hours to get enough coins to buy it. I can‚Äôt get the new Mago class and I‚Äôm sad because it seems really cool. If you increase coins given(about 100 or 200 coins per match), or lowering the price of guns so the coins that we do get are worth something, it encourages smarter gameplay and experimentation with different guns and classes. Other than that, the game is amazing! I love the new Assault map!

Developed by series creators Rockstar North, Grand Theft Auto V is available worldwide for PlayStation¬Æ4, PlayStation¬Æ3, Xbox One¬Æ, Xbox 360¬Æ and PC. Set in the biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game‚Äôs three lead characters. When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other. All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto‚Äôs darkly humorous take on modern culture.

With the expansive game world and fluid mechanics of Grand Theft Auto V as a foundation, Grand Theft Auto Online expands and evolves with regular content updates created by Rockstar Games and the Grand Theft Auto community.

Not only is this app informative but the aesthetics are high quality with a sleek streamline interface, navigation to each section is made easy with a pop up menu on the right side and text that is easy to read although for those who can't see that well it would be nice to have customization. From the start the app sets you on the right course as you choose what platform you are playing the game on and what language it is set in. From there you are able to explore the app as you see fit. There is a good wealth of content included in the application concerning information of all kind. The only area that I can tell that could use more data is Grand Theft Online. Maybe in the future this section will be beefed up. Besides that the app seems to fire on all cylinders. If you are a owner of this game, you need to own this manual. I think that this is a great manual especially when using the map feature.  It is helpful for finding various things that are not shown on the in game map like police stations.  I especially like the satellite feature for the map to actually see what the map looks like instead of the gps style map in the game.  Don‚Äôt listen to the children that give this low scores because they thought it was the real game.  If you don‚Äôt know what a manual means, then you shouldn‚Äôt play a 17+ game. This manual is an ultimate guide into the great and grand world of Grand Theft Auto V. Every single person who owns the game shall own this! It feels incredible to play the game and just click on the app whenever you need to check something out like the map. It really helps you know the game a little bit more and explore Los Santos and Blaine County. There is literally nothing else to say about this but that it will definitely help you throughout you playing the Story Mode or even I believe Online. Get it, it‚Äôs FREE!

I've always liked platformers like this. The problem I have with this game is it's is somewhat glitchy. I often run into invisible walls and sometimes I get sunk into the ground. If you are jumping from the edge of a platform, it will not allow you to jump twice,  assuming that the jump was already on its second jump. In the 12th level, I keep getting stuck between the rail and the ground when I am riding in the rail cart... then I die and have to start the whole level over again.  Little things like that can ruin a game. I hope they improve this game, because I really do like it and it is worth a play through even with the glitches.

Overall, I enjoyed my short time with this game. Sometimes a loss felt out of my control, but at least the Continue system is generous. Some interesting twists in combining combat with pinball, but there‚Äôs a limited amount of content and depth here. Would enjoy new content in the future. As is, a fun way to kill a few hours. Great concept, love the Game Boy Pocket grayscale art style, and there are plenty of different screens/tables to keep me entertained. However, this game is almost impossible to play because the left flipper only works about half the time, and it‚Äôs nothing but infuriating. Also, the pause button and magnifying glass button are in a terrible location on the screen; they‚Äôre right where I want to have my thumbs to use the flippers. And the fact that the magnifying glass icon starts highlighting itself every time you enter a new screen because it wants you to press it and read about the goals in the room is super annoying. Why would I want to stop the action to read the goals? Either make the goals more apparent without instruction (which I actually think they are, so it‚Äôs redundant) or have the goals flash on screen like every other video pinball game on the market.This has the potential to be a really fun game, but between the ONLY action input not working properly, and some questionable design and UI choices, I‚Äôll probably never be able to actually enjoy it.Definitely do not recommend this game in its current state. A fun game... when it works. As other reviewers have said, there is an issue with the flippers not registering being tapped which is really frustrating. Also, there is a magnifying glass that appears in the lower left corner that you can tap on to tell you what tasks you need to perform, but the game doesn‚Äôt pause when you do so you‚Äôll most likely lose your ball. Also frustrating. It‚Äôs a shame cause it‚Äôs a fun concept but until these bugs and issues are fixed, I‚Äôd stay away.

Using taps to hurl your angular avatars from one shifting platform to the next, you‚Äôll aim for boosts that‚Äôll rocket them even higher‚Äîor at least keep them from plunging to their game-ending doom. With pulsing electronic music and eyeball-caressing neon visuals, it‚Äôs like a dance party for your brain. Joyously simple and simply joyous. I don‚Äôt usually keep games for long on my phone, but I‚Äôve had this one for a long time now. At first, I didn‚Äôt get how to play it, but you‚Äôre supposed to tap to jump and land on the floating platforms and go up. It sounds easy, but it gets harder as you hit higher up and the platforms become smaller and faster so you have to time it right. The game just updated and it seems to be optimized on my iPhone 11‚Äì I don‚Äôt see any more black bars- which is great. You can also change the quality (HQ high quality or LQ low quality for ex) in the pause menu settings. You can also change the voice, music and vibration settings as well now (I don‚Äôt remember if you could change them before). At the bottom screen you can pick the song you want to play once you unlock them. The way to unlock songs is written on the locked song such as ‚Äúreach exactly 100 points.‚Äù Beat Stomper is fun, colorful and visually hypnotic way to kill the time and with great music too. First off, I'd like to complement all of those involved with the development with this game as it is absolutely phenomenal. The combination between a platform climber and music was a fantastic idea that was executed excellently. So great job to you all. Second, I'd like to report what I think is a bug. When sound, music, and character voice are all muted, there is still a faint sound in the background that is playing. I'm not sure if that is supposed to be there as that sound seems to go with the music. If you could fix that in a later update it'd make the game even better. Thanks for all of your work and I look forward to playing more of your games in the future.

It may have been the only Atari game that I actually flipped or maxed the score on.  I also loved Galaga in the arcade and it would be coin toss between that and Ms. Pacman.  Galaxoid is obviously referencing those two games, but with a nice modern flavor.  I love the boss fights, which add another level of difficulty as the gameplay gradually ramps up after you defeat the boss.  The little touches of interactive power ups and laser beams are a great addition.  While, I can see how some may disagree with your spaceship staying at the bottom of the screen the whole time, I disagree about the touch controls being terrible.  they could stand to be a little more like Plasma Sky, but it's fine the way it is. Maybe the addition of an auto shooter could be cool, but it's not necessary.  Get this game if you love Space Invaders, Galaga, or modern iOS shmups!!  It will have a permanent home on my iPad, for sure. A great pewpew kinda game, sort of a mix of Galaga and Space Invaders, very fun. The graphics, music and gameplay will please devotees of the 80's arcade experience.The two things I DON'T like, however, are that there doesn't seem any way to save one's game, and if one is foolish enough to do something else on one's iPhone with a game paused, that game is GONE. Since a game can be pretty lengthy, this seriously compromises it's casual use, which is what makes so many games great. Also, it doesn't look as though there's any way to upgrade weapons or capabilities...and being a ""retro"" game that really isn't something that's expected, but I did find myself, after several levels, wishing I could change it up some.There IS an alternate weapon, the Laser, which is very powerful but a little clumsy to get to. Otherwise, the controls are exquisite!$1.99 seems a little steep for a game this simple, but I'm certainly enjoying it!

The maps need to be bigger. The maps size seems a bit to small for 3v3 game. You get constantly get hit by every one and it feels like you can‚Äôt escape.2.All the cars feel the same. You should add some changes to each car making some faster or making some hit harder. Make the cars have unique traits to add more to your game.3.We need more. Right now there seems to only be one 3v3 game mode against bots and I know that you plan on adding multiplayer but don‚Äôt stop there. You can add 2v2 and 1v1 game modes with smaller maps for 1v1s and larger maps for 3v3s.These are all my complaints for now. The game is still wonderful and I will continue to enjoy playing it. Just in case the title isn‚Äôt completely visible, this game is essentially rocket league but with bots far worse than the rookie AI, and that includes your own team. In other words, while it looks like a 3v3, it‚Äôs more of a Free for All, the reason being that the bots are seriously just programmed to follow the ball and boost jump forward whenever they get close to it.  So if it‚Äôs heading toward their own goal and they‚Äôre behind it, they while try to shoot it in to their goal (again, your team too).  Also, since they are programmed to just follow the ball, that can lead to you getting completely surrounded by both teams, and unable to boost jump or even pick what direction your driving in. Note, this game will make it seem like they are real people by giving them unique names that you‚Äôd typically see online, and I almost fell for it, but if you play long enough, you‚Äôll realize that all of them are bots just following the ball, which makes the games rather boring.  You can also kind of tell that it‚Äôs AI because you ALWAYS spawn in the middle, and that‚Äôd be very unlikely if you were truly playing with real people. My suggestion is to either update the AI so they can actually function properly, or add a PVP mode. I deleted after realizing the ads come up between every game and get gradually longer.  Also, you want to charge 20 dollars a month for access to 5 cars and ‚Äúabsolutely no ads‚Äù.  I‚Äôll pay to remove ads from games if I like the games because I understand developers need to monetize an app somehow, but seeing that this recurring payment gets you ‚Äúabsolutely no ads‚Äù is suspicious to me and lead me to delete the app.  But a recurring payment of 20 dollars a month or 7.99 a week for 5 cars is insane.  That is substantially more than a Netflix subscription or Apple Music family plan.  Do you really think those 5 cars provide more value than those services? Not a chance.  I think you‚Äôre almost knowingly doing that so that some children click on it and it becomes a recurring payment for their parents to foot the bill.  That or people who literally don‚Äôt care about what value they‚Äôre getting for their money.  Enjoy the short period of time your app will be popular because it‚Äôs clear you care about one thing and one thing only.

I was surprised when I got this game because there were no ads. If you are annoyed by ads (like me) buy this game. The only reason I bought this game was because I play with LOL dolls. So what do you mean by ‚ÄúI have some suggestions‚Äù? Well, this game is kind of simple and plain. All you really do is play a mini game and collect a doll. Kind of like LOL dolls in real life- you just collect LOL dolls. Maybe you can spice this game up a bit up by adding more mini games for a little variety, you know? Maybe we can actually be able to scan real LOL dolls and play a mini game where they walk around and, oh, I don‚Äôt know, try to get to their capsules by passing obstacles before they run out of lives. That‚Äôs all, so bye! Hope you can improve the game! üòÉ I found five glitter ‚ú®  globe lol dolls. Their name are : N.Y.E.Q.T, miss snow, bashful Q.T, bold B.B,and sleigh babe.  I need seven more to find. I need to find the objects. Nye has her perfume. Ms. Snow has her magical snow book. Bashful has her bright flute. Bold has her journal. Sleigh babe has her sled. I show my sister the surprise. Let me know when you‚Äôre ready for the next lol doll. Now we need to find figure 8. She loves to skate with her ice skate. The wicked witch of winter has figure 8‚Äôs skates. The wicked witch of winter is melting in to water. Sleigh babe got the water which was the witch and drink it. The lol dolls are living with me and my siblings and my parents üë©üèø‚Äçüíºüë®üèø‚Äçüíº. I love this app but when I was around my sisters, they yelled at me and I got in trouble because the lol dolls were talking about them. On pointe is a fairy lol doll. I hope my advice with snow leopard is doing better. She has a little leopard cub. The cubs are sleeping. Snow leopard. I am stuck with witch baby. I am popular. The popular girls walked up to me and said: GO AWAY, LOSER! I am not a loser. I am a winner for my lol dolls friends üë≠. The boys in my class hates lol because they are creepy but they are not that creepy. I like her teddy bear and hug me. We have all the lol dolls glitter globe.

I love this game! And... there‚Äôs a few things that can be updated but.. this app is so underestimated. Listen.Ok, first, the new update where one your done with a map you lose all your items makes it much more challenging! I love that! However, you can save up 40 coins to keep your items. Also, you don‚Äôt HAVE to pay for coins. As you play, you earn more coins! And, there is another way to earn dolls nobody knows about! Just click on the spy glass in the bottom right corner and look for emojis every day for a week for a new, free doll! Now, they could have advertised that more but, it‚Äôs all good! So, this game is great! BUT WHERE ARE THE LIL SISTERS AND PETS? That‚Äôs the only thing I don‚Äôt like. WHERE ARE THEY? Also with this game, it‚Äôs free and it dose not need internet! This is a dream for parents because, your not buying the app, your not buying lol, and this is a LIFESAVER in cars, planes, and power outages.This app definitely deserves five stars! Thx! ","L.O.L.

Also, im really not sure what the tier up level does for the builders as there is no help screen. But i love this game so much as there is no forced ads. And no forced buying to progress in the game. As the title says, this game is fun for the first bit. I opted to pay the ~$8 for the double income and the ad-free gameplay; it speeds up the game, but now after running through the 21 levels about 6 times, I have maxed out the facility and supporters pages so I have no use for the gems you get at the end of each stage(10k+ in storage). Also I have maxed out the worker page at 100 ranks in speed and cash, with 160+ workers. So now I have nothing to buy apart from a worker every couple of levels, but I just keep building the same 21 buildings over snd over... this game needs more variety in levels and something else to spend gems on as even without paying for the ad-free you could still run out of things to use them on by the 10th playthrough. Now I‚Äôm not talking about completely removing ads 100%, that‚Äôs just stupid. I‚Äôm talking about removing ads from the upgrade buttons. Remove the ads from menu button. Stop reskinning games for a quick cash grab. If you spent half as much effort in making a good game with NON-INTRUSIVE ads you‚Äôd make so much more money due to more people playing, watching ads they want to watch, and buying packs of in game items.Look at games like Egg Inc., Pick Crafter, and a whole slew of others.

I know you are trying to keep the game the way it was back in 1992, but ,since it's not MS-DOS(PC), I don't think people will complain about few new buttons that would replace some ""older"" ones. That especially goes to the combat part, which is very complicated with touch screen. Not to mention the ""sticking"" moment. Also make menu buttons tappable, not controlled by arrow buttons. If that means you'll have to change menus' layout, then do it. Just keep the art style. Again, this is not PC.- Would be nice if you could bring back the details of all 3D objects. Here they have less of them than in PC version.- Fix the music. Some of music tracks play where they are not supposed to. Music in the beginning actually plays when the doors of Derceto close once Edward/Emily go through them.- It also would be great if you could add voices that read texts(character info, letters, books, notes)For now that is all. I sincerely ask you to consider all these moments and do something about them. Thank you for understanding! Playable on the iPad.  The original game had pretty hard controls.  And it's even harder on the iPad mostly because the controller ""button"" has to be pressed by multiple fingers to be effective.  The double tap to run is very hard to do on a touch screen.  Also to turn while running you cannot slide your thumb to the side buttons to turn.  You can use a second finger to press the left or right buttons, and that makes the game at least playable. But I imagine that would be too difficult to do on an iPhone.  If they lengthened the double tap to run just a bit.. And made it so that the controls would let you turn with a single finger, then this port would be excellent. I still had  fun with it. This was probably the first survival horror game ever. And lead to the games like resident evil.

I would play it on my dad‚Äôs iPad in the mornings, the music was catchy, it was satisfying to collect gold medals and Grimmy Idols. However, there‚Äôs a huge problem and I know I‚Äôm not the only one who‚Äôs experienced this. After I spent hours collecting skullies to buy the Danger Caves map, I collected all the Grimmy Idols so I could try out the Iron after avatar. I selected it, selected survival mode, and then it crashed instantly, before the game started. I didn‚Äôt think much of it and I pulled the game up again, changed my avatar selection because I thought that was the only problem, but it crashed yet again. I can‚Äôt get on adventure or survival without the game crashing as it loads, even if I don‚Äôt have the Iron Fred avatar selected. I tried to look up how to troubleshoot this problem, but there were no results, so I thought I was the only one. Upon reading the reviews and learning that this has been happening for quite a while, it‚Äôs an even bigger problem than I thought. Aside from Falling Fred (which isn‚Äôt even available for the device version I‚Äôm using) none of your other games give me that same amount of satisfaction and nostalgia as Running Fred. C‚Äômon guys, you gotta get this fixed. Currently, the newest game you guys at Dedalord have made is football Fred, and I kind of find it as an unoriginal game. I was really hoping that you make a sequel to this game, because I‚Äôm sure that would probably be your mostly downloaded game, and because I also love this game, but can‚Äôt play it due to it crashing every time I start playing it. I hope you read this, Dedalord, because I think it will be a great idea for a new game to start working on.I know for sure I would love a sequel to running fred. Also, make sure gameplay stays exactly like this one, because I don‚Äôt want a clicker or a sports-related title, just running fred, but improved and better to play. This game is really good! I always used to play it when I was very younger, and I downloaded it again just because I thought it would be cool. The game was going great until I downloaded the character ‚ÄúIron Fred‚Äù. For some reason, I can not get into adventure mode, survival mode, or any mode when I unlocked the character. I can‚Äôt get in even when I am not using the character. Please fix this issue, because this game is amazing to play. I do not want to stop playing it. I also do not want to uninstall and reinstall the game because all of my progress will be gone.Edit: So it‚Äôs been a couple of months later and it still doesn‚Äôt work. I tried uninstalling and installing again but the game keeps my progress, which means I still have the Iron Fred, which means that I STILL can‚Äôt play. Can you please fix this glitch, there are many fans of your game who can‚Äôt play because of it. I really want to play this game because I love it sooo much, but I can‚Äôt. If you can‚Äôt fix the glitch, can you or somebody help me delete my progress at least so I can play. Your fans including me have been patient.

And this is one of the few games that actually supports my device‚Äôs native resolution and I get a beautiful full screen, without any ugly black bars that even BILLION dollar game developers, cannot seem to take the time to get it right lol..THIS GAME DOES. It actually utilizes the power of my device, and runs butter smooth while doing so! I‚Äôve owned my iPad Pro 11‚Äù 1TB since around January of 2019. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt my iPad get warm lol. Not hot, but just warm, yes the first time ever! Lol! So, that tells me this game is using my iPads beastly A12X CPU, and wicked awesome GPU, and some of the 6GB of ram that I have. I love this game, I was just playing it for about 20 minutes, and I just had to minimize, and come back on the AppStore to write a review about it. Excellent game developers right here! Very smooth! Very fluid, excellent graphics! This developer needs to make a ‚ÄúFirst Person Shooter type game‚Äù they would blow PUBG out of the water! PUBG still has big black bars on my iPad Pro 11‚Äù 1TB and they‚Äôve yet to add support for my native resolution even after nearly 5 months since launch. Thank you for making a game that shows off our devices so well! And please, try and make a different game GENRE. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!!! I love your game but I feel it is missing a bunch of other iconic jets. I do understand your game is still being worked on and I can‚Äôt wait so see what other planes will be added!I hope to see this game advance, it has a lot of potential! If possible I‚Äôd love to see helicopters at some point.  My overall rating on this game is 5 stars, it‚Äôs a really beautiful game and I love the jets in the game. I haven‚Äôt lagged much while playing this game either with only one or two of the occasionally lag spikes. I‚Äôd like to see a radar guided gun for some of the jets as it would make some jets easier to aim with, like the lower tier jets. Giving lower tear jets easier to aim weapons would make it a little easier to progress. Alliance credits, in my opinion the alliance credits are way to hard to get a lot of. Please make these credits a bit more numerous as upgrades get pretty expensive and it takes a long time to get these credits. I do love the Ace battle mode as it does pump out a lot of credits if you can avoid a lot of missiles. This is all I have to note on this game, I love the game, and keep up the hard work! Don‚Äôt rush this game as I may lose quality if it is rushed! Thanks. Overall this game is really ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, and fulfills all most of my expectations. The graphics are like what it says in the description: photorealistic. There are no ads in game to disturb your gameplay (in my experience), and it is a really smooth game. Although right now the game is good enough, I would really want more content and missions, though I know they would be coming in future updates. It would really improve the game if you could add historical campaigns (for the time periods that actually happened, like WW2), bombs that you can drop from planes, ground forces like tanks and infantry that you can support or fight, carriers and landing strips that you can return to in order to repair, and/or switch planes, and finally, an improved multiplayer feature, as the current one is pretty laggy. I know I‚Äôm asking for a lot, but in my opinion they will really improve the game, and the developers can install them in individual updates instead of a massive one. In all, this game is really awesome and it‚Äôs a great addition to your games collection. Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

Supercell‚Äôs awesome card battler delivers excellent deck-building mechanics and fast-paced fights in a package that‚Äôs easy to understand and undeniably fun. Upgrading, unlocking and experimenting with cards gives the game endless replayability, and deciding just where to drop your heroes makes each battle distinct. But no matter how good your deck is, there‚Äôs no substitute for skill and quick thinking. UPDATE: Originally, I left a one star review to get attention of designers (see issue described below). It's been less than 2 weeks and the UI design of opening chests changed so that the open now gem button is on the opposite side of the queue button. I assume there were many similar complaints from devoted players, so props for listening to your customers, for implementing a fix so quickly, and for crediting the gems I spent. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I usually don't leave reviews. But the UI change of the chest interface in the latest update is aggravating. I don't know if the button to pay gems to immediately open a chest was moved or re-sized or what exactly happened, but my thumb's muscle memory of hitting the ""queue chest"" button from before the update has instead made me hit the pay gems button 3 times since the update. Something clearly changed, and it feels like it was changed for exactly this reason -- so that players would accidentally open chests by spending gems and either have to buy new gems or wait longer to collect free gems. Love the game, been playing for years. Love the new clan wars 2 update. But this is the first time it feels like a UI change was done to trick player, so no love for that. And I don't know if a second prompt existed before (are you sure you want to pay gems to do this? Y/N), but either one should be implemented or both buttons' original locations should be reinstated. I think that this game is amazing and is always being rebalance once a month to make sure there is not a over powered card that is in every deck here is a piece of advice to those struggling against mega knight use a card like minions minion horde or inferno dragon they take him out in seconds and can be used as a counter attack I have been able to get to challenger three and collect every single card except for electro wizard and I have only have had the game for a little over a year and I have found most problems with glitches are wifi induced I currently think the game is perfectly balanced and am thankful that their are people updating every 2 months to add so much content ( some times it becomes overwhelming) and every month a new list of rebalances i am so glad this isn‚Äôt a pay to win game which it so easily could be also in clan wars the level of your cards is based mainly on clan participation so maybe you should rally your team mates to participate more and increase your chances in winning and the tournament system could be fixed but no game is perfect so I just deal with it and it is obvious to see the effort put in to this game and when you get to a certain point in the game ( when you can be drafted into a   specific team and can earn money rewards ) they ban multiple accounts and I kind of see it as cheating in a way if you just try hard and think it through it isn‚Äôt that hard ","Clash Royale, Supercell, Games, Strategy, Entertainment, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

But the storyline is over too soon. I got a new phone, redownloaded this app, and it's been less than a month and there's no story left (I play whenever there's a lull in the day). And I would've liked more weapons years ago. The minigun and striker are really the only fun and effective weapons to have. On my old phone, I hit level 50 and have been basically raking in money as gameplay. I've almost 6 million dollars and nothing to spend it on except the occasional health boost in the arena or a laser cutter for rare emergencies.Knives would be great, maybe a sword option, I like another commenter's idea about the flamethrower, a sawed-off shotgun, sniper rifle, any of these would work. This game is great, and that can be a problem for the developers because great games need maintenance. We all want an update. I've come to love the minor glitches and integrate 'em as part of the game, so I'm not really concerned about that as much as I am wanting more story and weapons. It's a good game, that's why we want more! Great App! One of the few games like it where one doesn't have to be a big spender to play. Highly recommend it for zombie themed FPS enthusiasts. While overall good gameplay, it's not without its flaws. Would give five star rating if not for one major glitch in the system. Something that could be fixed if one of two things were included in the update: The ability to interrupt the reloading process, or the option to disable said processe's automatic function. In the current version, reloading leaves player unfairly vulnerable to attack: Unable to switch weapons, or use items until the process is complete. Would be more efficient if player had the option to equip alternate weapon or utilize item instead of being forced to wait for current weapon to be reloaded once magazine is depleted. Being able to swap weapons or utilize items during automatic reload process would work as well. The trade-off of having to restart the entire automatic reload process when reequipping the weapon with the spent magazine would it be acceptable, as player would most likely be out of danger by then. Please consider for next update. I really was never into games. So I carefully read all the reviews and they are right very easy to play and a lot of free options to get gold and money for more equipment. I even got a new phone and that was the first thing I downloaded. And if you create an account you can pick up where you left off which is awesome cause I had more then 1000 in money and 300 in gold. Also they have great customer service when it comes to earning gold by downloading another app. I also love that option because most games say they are free and then turn around you get to a certain level and you have to play to continue. They also have many missions option that tell you if it‚Äôs easy or hard and they also give you a hint on which weapons are best. And they also have many equipment options and when it comes to guns they tell you how powerful it will be. I can go on and on I really love this game.

But then I got up to the room with the security turrets at the lab and what was a puzzle/story/adventure game suddenly requires reflexes that I, someone with a joint disorder, just don‚Äôt have. I tried‚Äî for hours‚Äî to get past that scene, and I watched play throughs, and tried to do what those players did, and I simply physically can‚Äôt. Usually when I encounter a game that‚Äôs going to need fast, calculated motion, I know it in the first few minutes and can nope out. This reminds me a lot of Life Is Strange in that it‚Äôs a game that I was able to play almost to the end and am now stuck because it is asking me to do something that is a physically impossible for me.  If you‚Äôre going to create a game where one scene has a radically different gameplay style than the rest, PLEASE either warn up front or have a way for players like me who can‚Äôt play in that way to skip the outlier scene. It‚Äôs so frustrating to get so invested in a game and then have to just stop without getting to know how it ends because the developers didn‚Äôt think about disability access. While I too spun around awhile coming out of the apartment building I was able to get around the glitches and finish the game. This appears to be a new game. The story was entertaining and I definitely think that minor glitches in no way should depreciate the fact that this is a five star game. You can fix glitches but the story/game itself is top notch. To the devs, I use IPad Pro 1st gen. I was stuck a few times in the air ventilation room too. I was able to either shut down to get out or just happen to hit it right. It almost seemed that the exit was off screen. Had there been a place that allowed me to save it, Along with your auto save feature, then I wouldn‚Äôt have lost minor progress.  During the airborne sequence it seemed that I had no control at all, I kept smashing into things. Maybe I was supposed to but even when there appeared something at the bottom of the screen I didn‚Äôt get it. Perhaps it was just me. The gyroscope is definitely touchy. I learned to slow down to keep it from looping. I wish there was a way to be updated in the game with new chapters (like an update appears that gives you the opportunity to purchase new episodes) as I look forward to purchasing the next one.  I only comment on glitches for your information, habit from beta testing. Thanks for hours and hours of good/fun entertainment. I like this game a lot. However, I am playing on an iPad Air (first gen), and the game crashes at the end of nearly every chapter, forcing me to replay it. The second time through it seems to save progress normally. The crash always seems to happen after the shield symbol ‚Äústutters‚Äù the second time.Gameplay is great. I love the interface, and moving around is intuitive. I enjoy having to choose the answer at certain moments.

I think it should have an option to turn off device movement to look around and just have an option to turn it off. Other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something fun for a road trip. Alright so the game is cool with how you build the guns but i do think the augmented reality should have a button to change because i have to sit up every time i want to play the game. however for the people saying that everything is to expensive try out slots. The 2 coin slot machine is good for coin building in the beginning but later on use the 4 coin one because in about twenty minutes i went through 200 coins and ended up with 47 plant seeds.  This ended up giving me over 1000 coins, however never use the 30 coin slots its trash. In the end the game is really easy to make money in and the main game is just for fun. Btw I played this game a while ago but i recently re got it. In short ive had the game for 2 days and im to the point to where i would be making 10,000 an hour i just dont feel like grinding and am waiting for a good spare hour. There is a glitch that on some levels the OPP shoots faster than the golden weapons and cheats. What the heck is wrong!? There aren‚Äôt many things to even do, and why did you have to waste money on Chances for plants!? Why is glass weapons a RIPOFF when they were TOO expensive? Why is the Aluminium pack 3 TIMES the price? Remove the pro pack also, it just makes people cry about like: ‚ÄúOoh, a pro guy used a 2x damage and barrel cheat, but I can‚Äôt do anything about it.‚Äù Also, remove the reload thing that you have to swipe down.

The controls definitely need work though (especially on larger screens).It would be nice to be able to resize the d pad and re arrange the buttons, and there should also be the ability to add a separate jump/roll button. With as complex as this I don't think that more buttons would be unwelcomed. You also can't rotate the screen. The melee button also should not make you go though elevators, because there's normally enemies right in front of them that you try to melee and end up going down the elevator.Overall super great content though, it's very very enjoyable and well worth the money (so long as it gets updated with better controls) The title says it all. I absolutely adore this game, I have bought it on the Xbox, my PC, my Nintendo switch, and now on my phone. It‚Äôs a very simple game, just pick an operator and run around either rescuing hostages, or killing all the enemies on the map. While simplistic, it is quite difficult, as your able to die very quickly by most enemies(which I appreciate) You may be asking, if I‚Äôm praising this game so high, why is it 4 stars instead of 5? Mainly it‚Äôs due to the lack of co-op. Any other platform this game is on, Xbox, PC, PS4 even the Nintendo Switch, has Co-Op and multiplayer. I understand the frustration of bringing in the mode while door kickers 2 is being developed, but I feel co-op could make this port of the game even better. Other than that, I haven‚Äôt encountered any glitches or bugs to harm my experience. Overall, an excellent game, and fantastic work from the developers. You guys should make a endless zombie mode thats wave based so you start on round 1 and the zombies are easy and every round it gets harder and zombies get more health and every round its different kinds of zombies and make it so you can change your loadout at the end of each round and be able to upgrade your gun with the money you make from killing zombies and with the gun upgrades should be like maybe you can have lazer bullets or fire bullets and be able to buy turrets or even call in a back up so that you can call up a npc to come help you fight but make it so they can die and you will have to get another one if they die but all these features are only in the zombie mode or you can do a mode with endless zombies or humans who shoot back but you have to make it wave based im telling you its gonna get good results from the community I promise That's a pretty complicated development you're proposing, but one worth pondering upon. We do have something designed along similar lines, maybe more down to earth. If we ever get to implement it, we'll sure revisit this too ;) No promises yet!

The game is one of the best you'll find. There are absolutely zero ads, you don't have to pay anything to progress through the game, and the game itself is one of the most fun to play. The clans make it easy to have fun with friends and to make new Clash friends which you can dominate war and clan games with. The Supercell's customer support is top notch they always got people to answer questions, listen to concerns and suggestions about the game, help you with any bugs or problems you have. As an example, one time I lost my village with all its progress for some reason. (This happened to several games) I told Supercell about it and they found my village and gave it back to me right away.The only move I have ever really disapproved of was removing Global chat. Global was a great way to chat with people outside your clan and also the best way to recruit. The new recruiting system they added to replace global is trash. I can't get anyone good with it. On global I used to build clans from scratch in a day. One time I recruited 20 people in a day to my clan. I was only TH 10 at the time. I understand why you took it away Supercell, but would like to see (a) it come back (maybe find a better way to do it) or (b) come up with a new recruiting system that works better than the one we have.Other than that, absolutely brilliant game I love to play. Well done Supercell. üëèüëè Overall Clash of Clans is a very enjoyable game. I love being able to be in a clan with my friends and building it up will other good players. However, ever since global was taken out of the game, it has been much harder to find and get new non-rushed, kind, and loyal members to join our clan. I know global was taken out because many players abused it and were mean to other players, but I believe it was a very important part of the game to find new friends that you would enjoy talking to, and playing the game with. The new thing that helps find clan members (in my opinion) is not very useful. Most of the players are very rushed which don‚Äôt fit the requirements of the clan I‚Äôm in. One other change I would like to see is the time it takes for buildings and troops to upgrade. The gold pass is a very good option to shorten the times, but I‚Äôm still a kid without a job, so I‚Äôm not always able to use 5 dollars to buy the gold pass. I have gotten it many times before, but without it I‚Äôm struggling to ‚Äústay on schedule.‚Äù I‚Äôm a TH11 at the moment in the ending stages of it. I only have walls left and a few troop upgrades in my laboratory left. The troops left are dark elixir troops and I have no problem getting the needed materials, but the time is almost unbearable. This reason made me come to the conclusion of why I want the time to upgrade buildings and troops to decrease. Ok, so first I would like to start off by saying that your game is absolutely awesome. I play at least an hour a day every day and usually more. It combines fun, strategy, resource management, and action all in one magnificent bundle. I myself am a Town hall 9, but I rushed through the game way too fast and am very behind. Despite this, I love this game more than any other mobile game I have ever played. 10/10.The issue, however, is not how expensive upgrades are or how the game is super pay to win (it‚Äôs not). My issue, is the time. I don‚Äôt mind saving up my gold to strengthen my defenses, or get a exciting new building, even if it‚Äôs really expensive. I hate it when you finally get the 2 million gold for an x bow, and it makes you wait 3 days on top of that. It makes the game so much less enjoyable. Same goes for training troops. I love attacking and forming strategies with my troops. But it is kinda annoying that it makes you pay for the troops AND wait an hour and a half to even use them. I don‚Äôt mind some of the waiting, but waiting for more than 1 day for a seven dps upgrade that also costs you 1.5 million gold is ridiculous. I‚Äôm not saying remove the wait time, but definitely cut down on it by quite a bit.But anyway, this game is super awesome and I don‚Äôt mean to make it sound as though it‚Äôs a bad game. I really do love this game, it‚Äôs a brilliant work of art.

To start, there is no way to customize sound settings. The controls are awkward and there is so much lag that it makes playing glitchy and a bit frustrating. It crashes in me sometimes, especially when navigating to different packs. A few of the games seem impossible to solve for one reason or another and there are no hints, so that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre just stuck. Please fix! I paid money for this app and so far  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been worth it. I hope I‚Äôll get update this review but right now it‚Äôs really hard to enjoy this game because of the automatic repeating movement if you tap too long. Is there any way you can increase the delay for the repeating of movement in a direction? I can try to get used to tapping ever so lightly to move only a single space but as soon as I forget how sensitive it is I suddenly leap 5 spaces forward into water or fire. Having the option to toggle between auto repeat movement and single space movement might be an option too. I‚Äôd just really like to focus on the challenge of the puzzles without having to be ever so careful because the interface is oversensitive.Playing on an iPhone 7 Plus. iOS 11 I liked this game, very nostalgic but it needs to be more responsive, (I wish the music was there!!) BUT, the big thing is I got to level 21 and it crashes EVERYTIME. It has now become unplayable. I paid for this app- it‚Äôs annoying. I tried to contact developers but it brings me to a forum, no direct contact.

That‚Äôs all the problems that I can think of as of right now, so please if you can fix this problems it would be great. I‚Äôve just started playing this game and it is amazing, the graphics and the amount of detail is just wow! It‚Äôs very competitive and you can really fully costume enjoy your character, the best part of this game is that not all the content is downloaded at once, I like how you have to download stuff because it make the game more smooth and it allows you to play online on hotspot! There‚Äôs a lot I like about this game and at this point I‚Äôm not having any issues with it but I keep seeing some reviews that are not so great. Keep up the good work! I would also like it if you added more game modes that would introduce the player to a whole other gameplay/game style like mini games such as Capture the Flag or 1v1 solo duel, game modes like that would really be enjoyable to the community, I would also like to point out your rewards because they‚Äôre awesome! Lucky royale and daily rewards are probably the best for beginners because it atleast gives good rewards to those who are not that good at the game, unlike fortnite that makes you Pay for their currencies, free fire has several different currencies that get you something u want and you don‚Äôt have to pay a single penny to earn, u can just earn the currencies by completing the game and just basically playing the game, I love this game and I would really hope there would be more updates to improve the game style because this game finally makes it fair to everyone with its currencies and gameplay! Edit: As mentioned below Ive lost interest. Its the same thing every game! Go on a kill streak, Game gets serious lag spike i die instantly, and then i level up and get gold but theres nothing to spend it on. Oh yeah and ever since i logged onto FB not only has connection been bad but i haven't been able to select load outs anymore.  This game is great but the worst of this game is the greed. :/ I know fashion has nothing to do with the game but everything costs diamond barely anything costs gold so once you play it just gets old cuz your not gaining anything from it and you cant get diamond unless you pay real money. So already you've rendered gold useless. Rather than making all the clothes and stuff cost diamonds make most stuff cost a lot of gold so people can be motivated to keep playing and all the rare and unique clothes and stuff can cost diamonds which you can get by competing in events and stuff or completing challenges/quests. Do that and I give 5 star.

Thank you For this GREAT game!!!!!!!ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥Ÿ©(ÀÉÃ∂ÕàÃÄ‡Ø∞ÀÇÃ∂ÕàÃÅ)Ÿà!!!!!!!!!! All in all this game is very enjoyable. I liked how it was in the same style as clash royals but at the same time a completely different game. I was having a lot of fun until about the point where I hit the frozen noon arena. Up until this point, I had been using a lot of the same cards that I had got since close to the beginning or at least the ones I had been using I had been using for a while and have played many matches with them. About this time I realized something that almost ruins the game for me, you are essentially punished for using cards u like repeatedly. The whole system of cars trophies is good for the gems but after a certain point, it‚Äôs almost impossible to earn trophies with them. Basically if you play with a card enough, it will reach a ‚Äúhigh trophies‚Äù status which lowers the amount of trophies you can earn from winning a battle. This gets even worse when u do this with multiple cards and play someone with a lot lower party trophies. Why am I punished for using cards I like? Eventually, this could get to a point where I can‚Äôt earn any trophies at all if all of my cards end up this way. Developers if you are listening, please get rid of this system, if I like certain cards and want to use them more than others, I should not be punished for it. I love this game and have been playing it for a while . Im in the 3000s when it comes to trophies and ranking but my gosh every time i come across an egg i get the same things over and over again and waiting EIGHT HOURS FOR EARNED REWARDS DELIVERING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS NOT FUN. I play against people around my ranking and im always seeing loads of new clones being used and yet i never see them pop up for me. Ive been recycling the same clones practically the whole time since i started and not for nothing those clones that i keep seeing are very powerful and bust through practically everything i throw at them making challenging people even more difficult cause im not getting anything that can match up to their clones. If the random findings of clones in the eggs can change a bit so its not THAT rare as it is now . Ill definitely be more happy than i am now playing this. Also if you can cut down The time frame for eggs to hatch or allow watching ads to instantly open them or to get green gems more often that would be amazing as well!Regardless the game is great and a lot of fun and can be funny at times !

Although this game has autoplay, it is easily turned off, and it usually only reactivates itself for very short quests (I would prefer that it never activated though). It‚Äôs usually pretty simple to navigate without auto on, but I find it odd that distance arrows appear while on auto, but not on manual control (obviously they‚Äôd be far more useful in the latter-I‚Äôm pretty sure the AI doesn‚Äôt need the arrows). One small issue I‚Äôve noticed is frequent differences between spoken dialogue and subtitles. It can be quite confusing at times.A far larger issue to me concerns customization: there are costumes, but they don‚Äôt fully address my main issue, which is hairstyles. There are no hairstyle options while customizing your character, and all of the hairstyles available to purchase currently are tied to their respective costumes. Also, all of the hairstyles for female characters are quite long. I‚Äôd like for my female character to have short hair, but right now that‚Äôs not an option unfortunately.Other than the customization complaint-I‚Äôm really enjoying the game so far (and I really hope the dev will consider bringing the autoplay options in this game to their other games *cough* Novoland *cough*). I absolutely love this game. It‚Äôs really cool, the graphics are good, the quests are just hard enough so that it can be challenging but not so hard that you want to rage quit. I like all of the dungeons especially and all of the bosses you fight there. My only complaint is how hard it is to get new pets and mounts without buying them. If you want a free pet, you have to do a dungeon or a special event. Those are pretty fun, but for me at least it has been really hard to get a pet. I have done way over 100 dungeons and/or special events and I have only gotten one pet, not to mention a mount. And if you want to get mounts, you have to do the same things to get a pet, only with a much smaller chance of an already really small chance. Or, you can do the clan things and get those gold circle crown coin things, (I don‚Äôt know what they are called sorry,) and those take forever to get. I would just like there to be a easier and/or cheaper way to get pets and mounts. I think it would make a lot of players including me a lot happier. The only easy free mount I can think of were the golden night owl and dark moon lion. And the dark moon lion does not even stay with you forever. The easiest mount to get besides that would probably be the arcane broom, and that still takes some saving up. But overall, this game is freaking AWESOME and if you haven‚Äôt played it already DOWNLOAD IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING FUN THINGS ARE IN THIS APP ITS AN AMAZING GAME :D This is an amazing game, but it has one really depressing problem.  When the game first came out they essentially promised it was free to play with purchases affecting mostly cosmetics.  Now it is entirely pay to progress.  You can play for free, but there is a whole category of legendary gear that you will never have, and what is even more troubling is that they have choked the resources for leveling this gear, so if you have paid hundreds in the past to get this gear but stop continuing to pay large amounts every month, all your previous purchases quickly become null and void (unusable). This sort of issue is responsible for a great deal of turnover from dedicated players.  As the ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù for the game weakens, new players willing to fill those roles will decrease and the game will see unrealized potential revenue.  Those responsible need to let people continue to be able to use what they have purchased/invested in previously.  Introducing new pay to win aspects is natural and occurring also, but choking previous markets (especially on essential gear) is a low tactic that only loses audience, revenue, and loyalty.One other thing...  with endgame, are tank and heal talents and stats ever going to actually be important to build? Right now it seems like there is one role: dps that goes off spec on anything it wants.  Tanks build damage, healers build damage, everyone just builds damage.  Kind of boring.

However the game does have one detail about it that bothers me (no it‚Äôs not that half of the Dino‚Äôs should have feathers) it‚Äôs the scale. While you did a grand job on most of the scaling some of the dinosaurs either feel a bit too big (I.e velociraptor) or way too small (I.e Allosaurus). And granted I haven‚Äôt hunted them in a while (especially allosaurus) and you may have fixed the dinosaurs sizes it still really bothers me. Oh and before I‚Äôm done with this essay of a review I‚Äôd like to say one little thing... the spino and rex feel a few feet shorter than usual.And that‚Äôs it really, hope you guys see this and cya! (I should probably check myself right about now) Hey hunter! Thanks for gaming with us and for your suggestions! Don't forget to share your ideas in the comments under the Facebook note https://www.facebook.com/notes/carnivores/suggestions-at-carnivores-dinosaur-hunter-hd/2037873802930357/, so we will never lose it! I‚Äôve been playing Dinosaur Hunter for practically half of my life now‚Äî And I enjoy the idea of it quite well. However, I agree that this game should meet more standards; And be updated more often since it is the only mobile app from the Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter series. Being true that Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn has been a bigger work in progress, including the fact that its graphics are very well improved apart from this mobile version, and Reborn acquires more hunting perks; I feel like it‚Äôs although fair to switch your eyes to this app often, updating it regularly every 2-3 months. Okay‚Äî First things first‚Äî The recent reskinning on some of the dinosaurs, I have to point out that it made me upset. The other skins that came with the certain dinosaurs when they were released in the game were more original; But now it feels like the reskins gave them the common colors that varied through every dinosaur in the game. It‚Äôs not only that, but there SHOULD be more dinosaurs, more diverse wether they‚Äôre soaring in the sky or lurking in the ocean‚Äôs depths. Also, the graphics are fairly good‚Äî But can be improved with smoothing and extra key details. I‚Äôm not saying that you have to turn this completely into Reborn, but give this mobile game more thought. With more work, I believe this game is only a couple steps away from #1. First off I get why this game is 5 dollars but for 5 dollars you have to meet people expectations. When I bought this I expected a hunt but it was just a lock and load shoot Dino‚Äôs and leave. Add a better detection system. I believe you just added a radius that is the detection zone but I think you did it all around rather than on the peripherals. Maybe add a food and thirst bar that you fill up by eating mochops and dimetrodons. Make the Dino‚Äôs harder to find but still manageable. Herbivores also defend themselves so maybe you should make them dangerous from tail whips to headbutts. Increase each dinosaur size by 2.5x so it feels more realistic. I get that this is a alien planet but the proportions will seem the same next to the dinosaurs. Also make the guns better! Instead of just having the gun in your back pocket why not have it holstered in your hand. Lastly the best feature you can probably add is Dino‚Äôs that kill and eat each other for food! If a carnivore sees a herbivore it will attack and kill. Which ever one is the heaviest will win the fight. Also add pack hunting for velociraptor. Make the allosaurus look like a allosaurus. Also make it so carnivores fight for meals. And make flying bird hunts.

Explore the cities and countryside of a vividly realized fictional version of the southwestern United States. You can tackle story-driven quests, gorge on fast food, outrun the police, or obey every traffic light‚Äîit‚Äôs up to you. This enormous game deftly displays Rockstar‚Äôs unique mastery of open-world design, and it never fails to entertain. Its a fantastic game, just like always. The controls are simple, but the storyline is complex, and great gameplay. Obviously, the graphics are top notch, but it makes up for it with storyline and gameplay. I love reading idiots who give it 1 star. No sound? probably because your device is horrendous. Bad controls? Check the settings. It honestly sounds like these people havent played a game in there life.Honestly, I cant complement this game enough. There are some missions that are hard, im looking at you, Wrong side of the tracks, but honestly, they are still fun. The side missions and things that you can do in San Andreas is epic. From getting haircuts, shopping for clothes, even being a paramedic! You can eat food and get fat, or work out and become strong. Or do both and become... Something. This game is one of the best, especially for mobile. I love this game, very fun, but there are a few glitches. The first one is on the robbery mission, sometimes when you get close to something CJ gets stuck on something and you can‚Äôt move which wakes up the person inside and then you get a 3 star wanted level. Another one is that the wrecking ball does not exist it is just a floating metal ball. Whenever I try to put a car in a garage it says you cannot store anymore vehicles in this garage even though my garage is completely empty and if I try to push my car in it will delete it. Another glitch I have experienced is that when I die during a gang war it gives the territory to me or it just removes it which I‚Äôm pretty sure is not supposed to happen. The last glitch happens on a date sometimes when you finish doing what she tells you to do instead of telling you to take her home, it doesn‚Äôt do that and when you do take her home you can‚Äôt drop her off, so you end up stuck with her and I have to restart the game. Also please put an option to disable tilt controls because I have to try to keep my iPad perfectly flat because if I don‚Äôt the car will pull to the other direction and it‚Äôs annoying.

Survivalcraft brings features you love in the PC version of the most popular blocky game to your mobile device: infinite worlds, caves, logic elements (electricity), weather, boats, ridable animals, explosions, clothes, armor and many more.

But I actually really enjoyed this game! Both Survivalcraft games were really neat. But why does the full version cost $3.99? I understand this was a demo to lead players into the game, but what if someone really enjoyed the demo, and wanted to see more? Well, they couldn‚Äôt, cause the full game is $3.99! Still though, it‚Äôs probably worth your money.Also, there are some aspects I think you could add into the game:- So far, the only supernatural monster is a werewolf. And while that‚Äôs pretty cool, I think the game could some more monsters, like skeletons or vampires, or something along that line.- Why are those sailors leaving you on the island for good? I didn‚Äôt quite understand that part. Honestly, I think it would be cool if there were more of a story behind that. (Like, maybe you committed a crime and then the sailors had to exile you on a far-off island)- Maybe you could add villages dotted around the island, so that there are others that you can trade with and interact with.These are a few of my ideas; but overall the game is fun. Keep it up Candy Rufus! Ok, so please read this whole thing before you download. This is only a demo version. The real Survivalcraft is loads better. However, the full version is $3.99.   Yes, this only lets you play for one day, but look at the title people. This is so people can get a taste of the game before paying $4 for it. Candy Rufus Games is doing you a favor. Giving you a free sample, just a taste, to see if you like it before spending money. And people complain that it's only one day. Yeah, the demo is not as fun. I agree. But the fun version costs money! I'm sick and tired of people calling Survivalcraft a ripoff of Minecraft. Survivalcraft has much much more stuff, and is more realistic, you can freeze to death or get sick or run out of energy. Minecraft is for building. Survivalcraft is for SURVIVING. The full version of this game is so much fun! hey since I played survival craft back in the old days, I really hated it because I hate minecraft rip-offs. but when I started playing this for free in ios, [I used tutuapp to download but it has limited days so ya] I also watched your vids. but then I realized, man, this is the greatest game! but one day, I had to verify the app alot. so when I verified it, it eon't really verify. so please, if you're reading this, I just hope you made a free and full version of survival craft 2. everytime it won't verify, I had to delete and install, and delete, and install and.. forever and ever till' 2019. so if you see this, please please make survival craft 3 free!!! because alot of people wanted to see alot! only some of us raged because we waste money sometimes.. just please do it!

A vertical climb game along the lines of ninjatown or doodle jump. With a unique art style, and great music this is easy to recommend. I personally found the controls easy to understand, and don't get where all the complaints come from... Half the screen is for jumping and the other half for grabbing, what's so hard about that?What I don't like about the game are the boost items that essentially = insta death. What's the point in punishing the player for picking up a 'special' item? If this one problem were fixed it would be a 5 star game. Oddy Smog's Misadventure is everything an excellent game should be. Simple to learn but difficult to master, the gameplay adds an original twist on the popular ""jumping"" genre. The prisoners add strategy to the game, forcing you to think quickly and go out of your way, though the score multiplier and ""wall jump"" are well worth it. The amazing graphics and music only make it that much more epic. The instant deaths after a jumping platform/rocket ship/teleporter are a little annoying, especially after you've made it a few thousand meters, but not enough for me to remove a star. An adventure mode would be pretty cool as well. Overall this is a fantastic app, and at $0.99 you have nothing to lose. You will not be disappointed. Good job overall, love the artwork and simple gameplay.  It's sucking my time to keep trying!  But pls, pls fix those annoying dead drop after the space ship ride or teleport.  If there is no gear directly above or below when you come out from the ship or the teleport machine, you are already dead with no choice.  Also would be great if have another stage or two with different background.

That was a great choice because this app is great! It‚Äôs fast-paced, enjoyable, and fun! Every time I go into this app I know it‚Äôll be a great time-waster, it‚Äôs amazing for long car trips, waiting areas at the doctor, etc. But the best thing about it is that it gives you a CHOICE whether you want to watch an ad or not! Most other games just shove tons of ads in your face to make them more money, but this game actually cares about the game that they‚Äôre producing. My only complaint is that most of the player base seems.. fake? I just got into this game, but I‚Äôve gotten 1st place every time since I‚Äôve downloaded this.. So, I think there‚Äôs a big chance those are bots playing. Not a big complaint, but I think it‚Äôll introduce me to new players as I get better, sort of as a.. ‚Äúcradling‚Äù technique. To introduce me to the bots, then slowly trickle in real players. Overall a great app though! I love this game so much it‚Äôs so much fun and it‚Äôs fun combined with super fun I love skating so I can‚Äôt do it right now because of the corona virus ü¶† but I saw a add and I‚Äôm like wow I love skating so why not get this app and a asked my mom and she said yes and I played it and I fell in love with it it‚Äôs so fun and I‚Äôm speechless it‚Äôs such a fun game I love it and when I saw that you can Change ur character I was like what!!! I love this app I‚Äôm never gonna delete it thank you for making it all I do is play it I love this app so cool and fun my friends love this app to they played it and said you need to get this app and I  don‚Äôt have a phone and a couple days later my birthday üéÇ and my mom got me a phone and I saw the add I was like hey this is the app my friends were telling me about so my mo got it and that‚Äôs it I gotta water üöø the grass by love the game Honestly, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this game. Though, it could be better. 1. Speed. I think you should make this faster without having to spend coins. It would make the game much more fun. 2. The music. The only time music pops up is when a bonus game is up, or when you win. You should make music on all the levels so everyone can enjoy the amazing bonus level beats! 3. Equipping your car. I have no idea how to swap from a skateboard to roller skates quickly. Theirs no ‚Äúequip‚Äù or ‚Äúsave‚Äù button. Adding this can maybe get you a 5-Star review. 4. Ads. If you don‚Äôt have the Ad free version, the ads almost pop up every time something happens. It generally gets annoying. Maybe you could keep the ads, though make it go less? It would benefit the game greatly. 5. Color. Like I said about the ads, they pop up EVERYWHERE. You need to watch an ad before coloring your character. Like I said, developers should reduce the ads. That‚Äôs all I have to say about this game. Though, I do really LOVE this game, these are just some suggestions. Stay safe!

I like how it‚Äôs not just another click/tap and actually engages the player but also allows you to still be doing other stuff while auto fight is on but don‚Äôt think you are safe just bc the AI is fighting for you because you will still have to shoot missiles down on your own. The fact that it also has a lot to do and a map to explore and plenty of cool enemy‚Äôs and allies is amazing. This game deserves a 5 out of 5 for being 1 of the few games on mobile that is actually amazing quality and not just a cash grab. I watch the ads (My own choice) to support them because I believe they made a amazing mobile game. So far I‚Äôve been playing for 2-3 days and I haven‚Äôt felt forced to do anything through my play through but I feel like they do hold your hand a little bit during the first couple of minutes but that‚Äôs fine and understandable and no where near as bad as other game tutorials. Overall please support this app to show that good mobile games are possible and don‚Äôt need to be cash grab garbage ad filled games to do well. This game is so fun. It‚Äôs very addicting and the perfect game to play when your feeling a little lazy. Maybe you just wanna relax, this is the game to hop on. To me, it‚Äôs super satisfying to watch, and it‚Äôs not difficult at all so it doesn‚Äôt get annoying. At least not too annoying. There is one problem with the game and it‚Äôs the fact that it gives you ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù hints. For instance, if you‚Äôre holding a ton of apples, the game reminds you can camp and cook em for upgrades. This sounds quite useful, until you find out the game won‚Äôt give you a break. I was debating on whether I should rate the game 4 or 5 stars and I went for 5 cause it‚Äôs a good game, but these tips make it annoying and unfortunately, sometimes unplayable. At the moment, I haven‚Äôt even been able to play because my pilot is max level so QUITE LITERALLY every five seconds, it reminds me to upgrade him and I can‚Äôt cause I don‚Äôt have enough gems at the moment, but it doesn‚Äôt stop telling me to upgrade him. Maybe their is a way to get rid of the tips that I‚Äôm unaware of but it gets quite aggravating. All in all though, this game is fun. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm part of a few people who have had a lot of trouble with the tips, so I don‚Äôt know if anyone else is having trouble with em, but it‚Äôs still very fun and relaxing. Hello! This may be relatively small, or tiny even, compared to the other responses. I love the concept of the game, being both active, and idle. I have 1 small suggestion. Since there is now the war supply feature, I would love to see cosmetic upgrades with not the heavy weapon additions, but the primary weapon upgrade for the units. What I am saying, is that the guns will change appearance when you apply that specific upgrade.  For example, take the mouse rangers. If you upgrade the primary weapon via war supplies, maybe like level 2 could be like a SMG, level 3 could be an LMG, and so on and so on. Then, apply this concept to all of the other units you can get. That is all I have to say for now! I would love to see you add this concept in game, as it gives he game an even better feeling than before. Please respond if you can, as I love having feedback. Thank you so much for the sequel, and keep up the good work!A former player, Wiley Andrews.

It got worse the longer you played the game. I‚Äôm currently on an iPad Air 2 running the latest iOS as of writing this review. There‚Äôs also a few texture bugs where sometimes things would turn into weird gray squares, but they're nothing game breaking. Gun controls could be better as well, but they‚Äôre enjoyable for the most part. The game gets a bit repetitive the more you play it too. But besides all that, it‚Äôs a solid and fun game. Interesting story and characters, nice soundtrack (although there‚Äôs only 4-5 songs per station), decent graphics for a mobile game, fun gameplay, and plenty of things to do besides missions. Be warned, though. The game has definitely showed it‚Äôs age. Overall a solid purchase and I‚Äôm happy. I just finished the main story and got everything I wanted to do done. Go ahead and buy it! I think it‚Äôs worth it. So I have been playing the game for 3 hours on and off and I noticed a couple of things you can't do. You can't do drive-by shooting and you can't aim wherever you want when shooting people. It was kind of a let down even though those are minor flaws. I'd love to see a update in the future where these two things might be addressed. Other than that, the game is amazing. Oh and it'd be neat if there was a way to enter codes to access all weapons, armor and to be able to drive the tank. Update: if you could make this game full screen and fix the bugs that are making it freeze up that would be great. I noticed GTA Vice City got an update and it looks way better in full screen for iPhone XS Max There once was an awesome review I spent probably 30 mins typing. Then I hit cancel instead of send. *palm to the forehead* ...almost drops phone and swipes on screen nearly deleting this.. #epicfail         This game is a classic piece of moving art.

(Lighting slightly off on mobile version)     Smooth frame rate.            I originally played this on my iPod 4th gen with Retina display 32 gb and was greatly impressed by how smooth the game ran. (Of course, once support of devices with iOS 6.0 stopped, the game became choppier) it runs like a charm on my iPhone SE as of now.     Thrilling Storyline. I'm sure you've played this before, if you haven't. Don't download it, remember??? You're not worthy!! (Haha)    Easy Controls.Sure it may be slightly complex at times.

Personally I don‚Äôt think the game needs much to be better, just some new level designs to change up the setting a bit as well as making the levels just a bit longer like maybe lasting 3-4 minutes instead of 1-2. Also adding some secondary objectives, like defeat a specific bad guy, or solve a simple puzzle, or unlocking new force powers like maybe a time freeze or a shield, or even some alternate paths to take would be great. Just a little something to change up your play options is all. An option for blood effects or disintegrating bodies would be cool too, but mainly adding little new elements to the gameplay would make this game a lot better, especially adding new level settings. I love the game, you should make more games with new powers! I also think the game could use some sound, it would also be cool if we could mess around with the dead bodies. It would also be nice if you had the option to look around. Other than that, good game!

Now that that‚Äôs done, normally have a relatively short attention span for any game, mobile or pc, but for some reason, this has held it. When the ads say constant updates, they mean it. Two heroes a month come out with constant events. Many times in mobile games there is stamina or lives to stop you from playing much at once. Hero hunters does have this, but since there are so many events and missions and pvp options it barely becomes a problem. That also stopped me from playing for hours on end. Which in turn stopped me from getting bored because on the game. To give an example on some games I will play 30-40 games and immediately get extremely bored. This game does have micro transactions which they are constantly pushing which can get annoying at points, but everything that you buy will permanently help you in some way. For example, if you buy gold and get some crafting materials, yes you will use them, and they are not infinite, but when you use them to upgrade a hero, it won‚Äôt become obsolete as heroes of every level are needed to progress (Gauntlet missions scale in difficulty, so even low level heroes help out a ton). Now this game isn‚Äôt perfect, but it is currently my favorite game and I highly recommend it. Let me just start by saying yes I am a real person and this is a genuine review. I started playing HH around the time it first dropped on mobile, and honestly there isn‚Äôt a single mobile game that I‚Äôve played that has kept me interested and engaged as long as this one! For starters, the game is super easy to pick up. It‚Äôs not difficult at all and there are plenty of heroes to unlock and upgrade so it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôll blow through in a short amount of time. There are multiple types of in game currency, as well as ‚Äúgold‚Äù which you can use to purchase crates that allow you to unlock characters a bit early. I know a lot of people see that and think ‚Äúmoney hungry‚Äù, but there honestly is no need to spend money on this game as they give you so many opportunities to earn the currency through participating in events! Something I‚Äôve never seen other devs do! This game has an energy system which early on really limited how much time you spent on the game, but now the devs have added several new game modes that don‚Äôt require it as well as daily quests and opportunities to earn more! All in all I recommend if you‚Äôre in to rpg shooters as this is probably my favorite mobile game of all time! 10/10 would recommend This is truly an amazing game I started playing I believe when it first came out got obsessed created my own alliance Alaska907 got my brother obsessed with it he joined my alliance and a couple of friends as well. It keeps me engaged and interested, longer than any game I‚Äôve ever played on mobile. There are of course a couple things I would change such as the alliance store it takes sooooo long to restock and they have a lot of the same things in there constantly. I‚Äôve been saving up alliance fragments to buy new hero fragments but it‚Äôs the same people over and over and I need new heroes. Also they start new god hero‚Äôs out at such a low star that after the events are over you toss the hero aside and don‚Äôt pay much attention to them because without them being at LEAST a 5 star they are useless. A couple of other minor things but for the most part those are my biggest concerns. Thanks hero hunters! :)Update...Of course I‚Äôm still playing and I still love this game! One thing I would love to see added in the next update would be a max hero skill button, I know it sounds like I‚Äôm to lazy to his a button 79 times to upgrade but it would save time to just hit one.

The leveling is hard enough to get you an amazing feel of challenge but at the same time not give you a sense of frustration. This game is what most other games fail to accomplish: a perfect balance. The hidden weapons and trinkets are hard enough to take you some time to find them but not placed in an impossible place. I only ever had to look up at ONE hidden trinket. I chose a balanced set for my skills. Meaning that I wasn‚Äôt putting ALL or most of my skill points on attack or health. Even with that I still was progressing normally and with a healthy amount of difficulty. All of the bosses had fair attacks and phases to the point that if you died it was more of bad planning on your part than bad/faulty programming. The best part of this game though, is that it never forces you to continue on the main storyline. You always have the option to spend hours leveling up or looking for hidden stuff as you try to 100% the game. All of that makes for one hell of a game for traveling or waiting for a class to start, as you will be spending hours piecing together the lore, or just leveling up until you are one-hit killing bosses. Definitely a must have game on any phone! I hate writing reviews but I‚Äôm so impressed with this release that I feel it‚Äôs my duty as an avid gamer to do so.....sooooo here it goes-if the castlevania/Metroid genre ( admittedly more the first than the latter) had a baby with a fine tuned rpg,then ud have this game.  Everything-literally,graphics,gameplay,story,overall execution,etc are done near flawlessly, 5 star all the way, if u,like myself have wished for a castlevania release on IOS,well then like myself ur gonna have to keep on waiting......BUT if ur down with the next best and in some respects better thing then GET THIS GAME....u will not regret itPost edit:had the game for a few days now and all I can say over and over and over is WOW just simply WOW....I from the bottoms of my heart wish u guys win some kind of game of the year award....it would take me multiples of multiples of paragraphs to do this game justice......This game is 100% worth double the asking price.....and this last bit is real talk-just to the devs: PLEASE keep making games,please,Grimvalor is an example of everything IOS gaming can and should b,u kno what I‚Äôm talking about and from one fan of tru gaming to a a group of who I can only assume is made up of the same-congrats-this game will go down as one of the best on this platform First let me start by saying that the 2D and 2.5D Castlevania games are my favorite games and have been for over 25 years!  With that being said, this is not a Castlevania game, but it in the same style of a Castlevania game, closest I‚Äôve seen yet on IOS.  The graphics are great, the sound experience and music fits the game really well, and the controls, once you get used to them, actually work rather well.  It took me a little to master (or try to master) the controls, especially some of the special moves, but lots of practice and I actually like the control system.  Of course, I‚Äôd rather play with a controller and always will prefer a controller.  The gameplay is fun, challenging yet not too difficult as in the early Castlevania games, the save points are strategically placed, and I really enjoyed the story!  One of the best action platformers with RPG elements that I‚Äôve played on IOS and I‚Äôve been playing IOS games for over 8 years now.  I look forward to this company‚Äôs next game, and would ask for some possible DLC such as new levels/areas and perhaps stronger weapons.  Excellent game for the money, highly recommend!

So. Much. Puke. The controls in this bizarrely clever platformer are spot on, but sometimes we‚Äôre giggling so hard at our barf-propelled hero that we slip up and die laughing. It truly is an Eggggg-cellent adventure. I like how the game gives the player plenty of chances to increase their jump accuracy skills with plenty of gradually increasing challenges.The game doesn't dump the player immediately into any""one mistake and you die"" situations. But those challenges must eventually be faced to make progress.If I were to change anything, I'd make the first level much, much longer, with each challenge just a tiny bit harder than the last. Every so often there would be a sign that says ""If you got this far, you've got the minimum skill for Level X."" With 'X' being  the level number that a warp portal next to the sign would take you to.The first level would be full of lots and lots of randomly generated background visuals and sound effects so the player doesn't get bored as they get enough practice to proceed to new levels. This will also ensure that easily frustrated players with lower skill levels will not give up too soon, while easily bored players with higher skills can skip on to the level that challenges them.It's a win-win for players of all types. Game designs shouldn't be completely linear. Such a structure forces the players to spend excessive amounts of time being stuck playing the one part of the game they are not good at and probably won't enjoy. The game structure should automatically route different players to the different types of challenges that they find most enjoyable. The game is wonderful! Awesome graphics enjoyable concept, levels, and artwork. The obstacles and treasures are really fun!Here's the HUGE UPSET, I can't remember what I paid ($3 or $4), but the game is tooo short, i felt like I plaid a ""Free Lite"" Version of this game. I didn't notice in the games description until now that I chose to review the app, but the game only has 21 levels, of which the first 10 are very short training levels. The last ten bonus levels (which are after fighting the final boss) are the fun and exciting levels with high anxiety obstacles that I enjoyed. Non the less, I completed the game within about 2 hours (including secrets and treasures) and felt really ripped off after paying about $4. Save your money, watch some gameplay walk through videos and you'll see what I mean. The levels only take about 1-2 minutes to complete, the final harder levels take about 6-12 minutes each your first time playing through them. After completing the game there's nothing extra left to do (unless you pay $3 more for 15 more levels) but to delete the app from your phone.I honestly was expecting many many more levels for a premium priced ios game like this.

Playing through the levels over and over is fun. Plenty of variety since there are ten levels with varied Bots to fight and weapons to dodge. Roll, jump, or take cover. You can customize your own Bot with upgrades. Seriously great game for the low price. When you play this game for the first time, all difficulties besides ""Easy"" are locked.  On ""Easy,"" almost every level in this game is a cakewalk, with the exception of the actually-somewhat-challenging final boss. Then, when you beat the game, all the other difficulties are unlocked.  Now, you can play the exact same levels you just breezed through, except presumably harder.  I say ""presumably,"" because after a d*** move like that, I'm not touching this again.The sad part is that there are still a lot of collectible in-game logs to find on higher difficulties, and they're actually entertaining to read.  But they're not worth playing the game itself.  In retrospect, maybe the developers should have asked themselves whether, out of all the game mechanics the App Store sorely lacks, ""cover shooting"" was the one that desperately needed to be adapted. I‚Äôve played this on my old phone when the game first came out. I played it for ages and now I‚Äôm playing it again on a new phone. One thing I‚Äôve noticed comparing the older version of the game is the lighting. In the old version, I could actually see what was going on on the screen, and in the scrapyard I could see what my robot looks like with different equippment. The new version of the game changed the lighting so much that everything is unnecessarily bright, there‚Äôs so much white on the robot, and it doesn‚Äôt look cool anymore when I put on different equippment. I wish there was an option to change the lighting effect.

That is how games have always been and this whole in-game purchase crap started with mobile apps. I have no issues spending money to buy a well made game but I won‚Äôt pay to play or pay to win. Thank you to the developers for porting over Titan Quest to iOS unmolested. Too bad they couldn‚Äôt of brought over the multiplayer feature as well. Great game, love it. Titan Quest has a special place in my heart. I started to play back when it was first released on PC in 2006. The unique setting, intricate class creation and amazing game flow still remain exciting to this day and I am thankful for developers that know that there are still fans of the classics out here.The mobile version is well ported in my opinion and I have not had any major issues. The targeting can be tricky so any characters that require specific aim may sometimes be frustrating to play, other than that it is amazing to play on phone and seriously one of the best values on the AppStore for this price. I give 4 stars only because there are some features that need to be updated that already exist on other platforms such as having a Storage vendor to store items, bigger inventory space, a button to sort items and other small QOL features.

I finally get strong enough to clear an area, move on to the next quest and normal mobs will kill me in just a few seconds, meanwhile I‚Äôm trying to use skills, drink potions, move my guy, all with only two fingers while my dude is doing little stutter steps due to a glitch.

I totally forgot about this game though until today. i was looking at the app store searching for ‚Äúshooter games‚Äù. I came across this and got a huge hit or nostalgia. It brought me back to awesome memories. I‚Äôve just got a couple problems. For starters, the graphics. Now everyone is complaining about the graphics and i agree with them. Not saying the game is bad at ALL. All i‚Äôm saying is i‚Äôd prefer better graphics. I think if you guys put some more effort into it you‚Äôd get pretty good graphics. Second, updates. I looked on the history and all of it was 7 years ago except for one. And that one was the last update there was. 2 years ago! This game hasn‚Äôt been worked on for a whole 2 years!!! My goodness. All my suggestion is that: lots of people still play this game. Creators, please be more consistent with this game. I‚Äôm not sure if the creators are working on other games now and have moved on or not cuz i haven‚Äôt caught up on their work. But these are all suggestions and random thoughts. Right before this review i started to re download the game and i‚Äôm ready to start gaming on this like the old days! Thanks! This game is surprisingly good. The graphics could be better, but the gameplay definitely makes up for it. The gameplay is really smooth, and that‚Äôs not very common in Mobile Shooters. I love that this game has customizable classes and all that jazz, it kinda makes it feel like you‚Äôre playing a console game. The AI is actually very intelligent and difficult to beat which makes single player challenging.There is only one complaint I have and that is the lack of content. This game should be a top priority for the developers, because this game is good. Very good. And it has room for even more goodness. I personally would love a built in friends list, like Clash of Clans. Also Custom Games would be cool, where you can play with other people and bots and set the time limit and score limit and difficultly of the bots. More gamemodes would be really cool, too. There is only four as if now in the game, and there would be many new game possibilities with extra game modes. There‚Äôs no shame in just adding Call of Duty gamemodes like Search and Destroy, Gun Game, Ground War, or Team CTF. It‚Äôs a mobile game, y‚Äôknow? Overall this game is fantastic I just really hope they add more content soon and even start updating the game regularly. This is one of the most pathetic cash grabs I've ever played.Now, ignoring the awful aiming and movement, this game is ACTIVELY TRYING TO SABOTAGE YOU. The AI is completely retarded if their your teammates but the enemy can instantly pinpoint your location and can do coordinated attacks while your team takes 15 seconds to figure out that they die if you shoot them. There is a semi cap the flag mode where you have to pick up a goat and carry it to get points. You are only aloud to use your pistol so your pretty much defenseless. This is important because your team will stand back casually as it turns into a 4v1 where the one has only a pistol. Luckily that won't happen because your team will always get to the goat first due to the fact that you will ALWAYS be targeted by the enemy even if your behind the entire rest of your team and also the goat will constantly run from the player. Not even your team but YOU specifically. Speaking of running away from you, if your team has the goat they will actively evade their teammates and run into the most open area, whereas the enemy team will hunker down in a crevice and their teammates will bodyguard them. You also can't look up or down and if you stop playing for like a month the game WILL RESET ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS.

It's a shame because they've made some really great hits (stick warriors being the top), and a multiplayer format for some of these games would really go a long way for the company.Anyway, fun update, solid game as always. :) I tried the classic mode. It is similar to Cartoon Wars but not as good. The strategy is so simple. You just try to defend your tower while waiting for your tropes to age until the $10,000 super robot available. You then can send the robot to the other side to destroy the other tower. To defend your own tower, you just try to upgrade the tower weapons and increase height to accommodate more weapons. Use the power up to kill all the opponents at once. You should try to avoid using the power up too much because it will draw power and slow your aging. Use the power up when the screen is filled with many opponents. You just use the cheapest $100 guys to defend your tower. You just keep at least 2 guys before your tower to avoid damage to your own tower. When you are on offensive, you can sell your tower weapons to get more money for two super robots and you will win. There are so many things wrong with this game. 1. When in the medieval age there is a spot right in front of the enemy‚Äôs tower where the turrets can‚Äôt hit you 2. $6 for generals?? It makes no sense why to get a general and it doesn‚Äôt change the game whatsoever 3. The easy mode is waaaaay too easy and the normal mode is waaaaay too hard 4. The AI are so incredibly annoying 5. The AI know when you have no gold to produce units so they use the special ability and obliterate your entire army 6. It‚Äôs worse than the computer version, and that‚Äôs hard to beat, good job game devs for being retarded 7. It makes me want to throw my phone across the room and shatter it with a sledgehammer because of how annoying the game is 8.

I can actually progress which makes it more fun that you have to progress to get to different shops, and things like that. I will give this game a 4- Star rating just because its a little bit too hard to get far with only standard things, such as rockets, umbrellas, spring board, etc. But if you developers can change or fix progression at the very least, i will give it a 5 star rating. Good Dayüòã So the game is pretty good for the most part, but like all games can't be perfect, however, that's not what docs the stars. At first I thought it was my phone, but after I reset it, I quickly realized it wasn't. The homepage goes ""numb"" where I can't click anything. It was working fine the other times I used it, but now it's kinda, stuck. I also logged into Facebook, and it's kinda annoying that whenever I open the app, it's pops up with the ""Can this app allow access to Facebook"" blah blah blah. So I also know the sensors in my phone aren't dead because I can click that button ""allow"" just fine, but when I try to start the game, the screen won't do anything. If you can make an update to fix these little bugs, then I think it has potential to reach a five star rating. Thank you! This is a great game! Now when I don't have my laptop with me I can still play Learn to Fly! As my review is titled, the app is nearly not as good as the Flash version on Kongregate, but since Flash will no longer be updated starting next year, this is definitely a viable alternative to crappy imitations if something goes wrong with your Flash program.Having said that, it is an entirely different game from the Flash version. The graphic style is not as simple, and therefore not as fun. The simplicity of the Flash game is gone. The humor of the Flash game is replaced by an inferior, boring humor. The Bonus Shop/Black Market is gone. If you liked the original three Flash games (not counting LTF Idle) for what they were as much as what they weren't, you will be disappointed by this game.

I had to play on the developers time when they wanted me to; now I can play on my time when I feel like it.The game has a lot of the little issues from the original like the feeling that the true enemy of the game is its auto targeting system that I often wish there was a way to let me quickly override in game. Otherwise its got the same great twin stick action and short missions with challenging objectives.This version does have some features removed present in the IAP version such as multiplayer which I remember was a really enjoyable game mode for me. I can't really fathom why that with be removed in this version but it really is a bummer not to have it.Theres a lot of potential in future updates to add things like co-op, multiplayer, a rogue like Risk of Rain style game mode or a boss rush mode. Even custom community made missions would be a great way to add endless content and value to players. I'm glad the developers went this route with the monetization and I really enjoyed how much I've played so far and I am looking forward to finishing and 3 staring every mission, ideally with a friend in co-op, but even the single player is a lot of fun. Gameplay is great. Now that it‚Äôs not free to play the money system seems to be broken though. You end up with so much extra gold with nothing to spend it on. Also every star challenge involves the same handful of guns for some reason. The game is enjoyable for the first few hours, but gets repetitive later on. I was excited when I began playing - tons of weapons, gear, and abilities to unlock - but as I progressed, the game‚Äôs shortcomings began to present themselves. You‚Äôll unlock everything around level 40 and then you‚Äôll be trapped in a cycle of monotony for the latter half of the game. Upgrades don‚Äôt feel rewarding, levels are copied and pasted with only minor tweaks, and the shooting mechanics are lackluster. Your gun aims itself, stripping the player of any sense of agency. Also the in game currency is handed out like candy, rendering it almost useless because you never have to decide what to spend it on. Want that upgrade? Buy it. Want this upgrade? But it. There‚Äôs no need to manage your resources sense they flow like water. Again, let me say, I enjoyed this game for a few hours, but by the end it felt quite empty, unrewarding, and tedious. Three stars for a solid two hours of content and no in app purchases, but nothing ground breaking here.

Please consider fixing these and BRING BACK THE CLASSIC. I love this game don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I really liked the old SM better. I didn‚Äôt used to be a pay to win game. It was fun and was a real strategy game, and you didn‚Äôt have to pay just to get good Items out of boxes. Also PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HACKERS. And even though they give a toxic energy pay attention to the bad reviews in order to make the game better. I personally think that the old versions of SM were better and had a better game experience. I‚Äôm talking about the versions that had more loot boxes or even the store. Back when it wasn‚Äôt pay to win and when loot boxes were better and had a better chance of giving the types of Items they were supposed to. I really liked the old SM and would greatly appreciate it if you would consider this. Thank you This has been one of my favorite games over the years. It is just so much fun whether it‚Äôs PVP or the campaign. One of the best things about this game is that it doesn‚Äôt spit an Ad into your face every 30 seconds. You have a choice to watch an Ad to get certain rewards though. While it may be pay to win, you still have to grind. Also, maybe adding some sort of base similar to Clash of Clans that you defend from Mechs would be cool. That would be awesome, just a recommendation for a major update. Also another benefit of this game is that you can play on pc and mobile too. Thanks devs, I really like the Clash of Clans type games so it would be cool if you added more things to your base and made it similar to CoC because right now the base is kinda boring to see and it needs an overhaul.

So if you want to survive as an intergalactic pilot, you‚Äôll need to think fast. Thankfully, dodging and weaving through Hyperburner‚Äôs gorgeous levels is pure exhilaration. We love how beating stages ‚Äúrewards‚Äù us with faster ships‚Äîit means the better we get, the harder the game gets. I thought this game was fantastic. While the experience was somewhat short (it took me less than a week to complete every stage,) each stage was exhilarating and jam-packed with fun. Only at a couple instances did it feel unfair/copy-pasted, and the difficulty curve is otherwise well-crafted. The controls are excellent, as is the aesthetic of the game. The cell-shaded, futuristic visuals made the game optically interesting while I whizzed by obstacles. It seems like some users experienced lag, but I did not on my iPod 6. In terms of dollars to hours, this game provided me over 3 times my money's worth. The extra challenges from the achievements do seem extraordinarily difficult, and perhaps I will never complete them (I currently have an achievement completion rate of 65%.) Regardless, the original levels are fantastic, and I think everyone interested in this type of game should play Hyperburner. While the graphics are amazing to look at, the mechanics are an issue. Even in some of the early stages, you must make split-second calculations in order to dodge the oncoming obstacles; level five of the first world in particular. Towards the end of this level you have less than a second to maneuver your craft into a hole barely big enough for it. Not to mention the rapidly shifting camera angles. The camera constantly rotates and, due to the quick finger movements required, rapidly zooms around, as well.The biggest issue I found, and the one that inspired the title of this review, is the hit box. If you are within what I'd say is a virtual foot, your ship will blow up. Clipped a pixel of ship's wing? Boom. Flew by too fast? Boom.In the end, it's a good game with flawed mechanics, like many other games. Don't just take my word for this, though. Take it as a suggestion, but try the game yourself. Who knows? You might find it amazing regardless of the issues. You might not even see any issues! Anyways, have fun and happy spacefaring!

Please ignore the whining reviews. If you decide to pay real money for a iphone game then you deserve everything that comes to you in the game. The developers have developed the game to make money. What else do you expect?? Its up to you to be responsible and realize that this is the motive and its up to you to have enough discipline to not spend thousands of dollars on a game! No one should have to explain this to anyone. The game is addicting and has held my attention for a pretty long time which is impressive seeing as I am the type that is quick to delete games. The only thing I hate is the wait time but I suppose that its actually good because if I can see myself playing this non stop and probably not getting as much done in real life. If you are a competitive and calculating being such as myself then you should enjoy the game. When I first got this game, I was thinking of being bombarded with ads, since previous games I‚Äôve played that are free. Include tons of ads during gameplay, but not this one thankfully! You can view ads to speed up (upgrades, more rewards, etc). At the start of the game, it was a bit tricky to understand the sicario‚Äôs, because I didn‚Äôt know how to place them on my camp. Thankfully, I ended up understanding more down the road. When you join a cartel, I was informed on much more about the game and certain strategies/tricks to learn on attacking & defense. I‚Äôm now a level 30 and still approve of this game being one of my favorites.Pros‚Ä¢Addicting to you‚Äôre not waiting for 5 hours off the app to wait for something exciting to happen.‚Ä¢In-App Purchases are definitely worth it since they give bonuses on top of what you buy. Rather than this is what you get at a flat purchase‚Ä¢Offers many ways of collecting more loot with ads /& speeding up upgrades, training camps, and etc. Cons‚Ä¢When other users attack your base. It seems game allows them to take too much and ends up taking slightly longer time to recoup losses. ‚Ä¢Match-Making has periods where it assigns you to people that you can‚Äôt attack because of there defenses compared to your current on hand offenses & the levels they‚Äôre at. Other than that, a decent game to burn time and binge on! Keep it up! Its very good game and cartel atmospheric gameplay make it better...But your team have to improve it :1.fix bugs , like ads : when I want to see ads to skip waiting for 20mins the game will be closed automatically ,,, chats menu doesn't work 2.make the game unique not boom beach2 by adding more things that player can do as a drugs cartel like deal scenes with man to man fire fight ( some thing like warships in boom beach as a real time fight)not man to defensive building fights And more unique gameplay objects like escape from police in a hot pursuit or fight with police, not other cartels because police is most dangerous enemy for drug cartels ,,, or add some mini games to gameplay to make game special ‚ù§Ô∏è ","Narcos: Cartel Wars & Strategy, Tilting Point LLC, Games, Entertainment, Strategy, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

The UI is great, everything is very responsive and the computers are not dumb whatsoever. However, I have two issues about this game that kept me from giving it 5 stars. First, every once in a while the game won't load after showing the headphone screen. I have found that a temporary fix is to keep reloading the game. You have to let Gamecenter show its notification as the headphone screen comes up otherwise just restart the game and try again. Second, which is the worst, the game has a tendency to throw your camera across the map when you just want to move a bit and it can be very frustrating when you have enemies attacking a system and you can't respond because your camera is being put on the edge of the map every time you scroll. This problem is random but can make the game completely unplayable for me. I hope you can fix these problems soon because this is a great game. Okay- hear me out. I love strategy games! Especially challenging ones. I keep finding myself coming back to this game. I just love how simple yet genius it is! To top it off the multiplayer is and amazing feature that you should take advantage of. Highly recommend it! If you find out that it‚Äôs buggy just uninstall it and reinstall.

And I have a lot of games. For starters it‚Äôs really easy to get free mode. And I love free mode because you could do what ever you want on it. And the levels are also really fun to. Mostly because you have a specific objective and you get to look around this whole entire city and bump into things and knock things over and look for what you need. Overall Dino simulator is by far one of most fun games out there and you will be missing out if you don‚Äôt get it. The game is fun when you‚Äôre not being interrupted by a stupid ad right IN THE MIDDLE OF GAME PLAY! I can understand having ads AFTER a round. That would make sense, but WHILE you‚Äôre playing the game? That‚Äôs just stupid and annoying! Plus, there are too many! The interruptions mess you up and the game starts playing again before the ad close button pops up, so you lose valuable time and/or you continue to take damage from the enemy. The dinosaur is a little hard to maneuver but I can deal with that. It‚Äôs just an added challenge. However, it would be nice to be able to choose what side you want the controller on, especially if you‚Äôre right handed.Oh, and at one point, when you first start playing the game, it tries to extort a 5 star review out of you before it will let you play one of the modes. Come on... you want a five star review? Come by it honestly and fix the above issues. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll give it a 5 star review. In the meantime, I don‚Äôt think it will be worth it to keep on my phone because the interruptions from the ads ruin the fun. It‚Äôs too bad because I was really enjoying the game. üòï I love this game so much,but the ads dont stop i just saw an ad about kick yhe buddy,but then the same kick the buddy ad comes up a few seconds later,ITS ANNOYING and i cant remove the ads so can you atleast have the option to skip?other than that i love this game and i have to rate five stars to get free mode and the t rex is not a t rex!!!!its a creatasaurs(sorry if I spelled that wrong)and can u have the option to eat the steak to heal and this game is really cheap and THE ADS MAKE ME DIE ","Dinosaur Simulator 3D: Free Jurassic Commando Game, Noor Ali Butt, Games, Adventure, Entertainment, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

Right before a match, an ad comes, after the match, an ad comes on. Even when I see an ad to get a free chest, right after that ad there‚Äôs another ad and not only that. Most of the time when I press x on an ad, the games takes away my ability to hear the tank move and shoot. And sometimes when I play pvp, if I win a match and then go into another match, the game automatically destroys my tank. And if anyone else didn‚Äôt notice already, when you take damage in pvp you take way more damage then you do when you play against a bot. I mean they could‚Äôve upgraded their tank but even kids with the starter tank like to troll other ppl and that just makes this game frustrating and unfair. I like to play this game when I am most of the time mad, so I like to take my anger on other ppls tanks but most of the time, ppl with frost or Abrams take away 3/4 of my health with one missle. The only thing keeping me from giving this game a 5 star rating is that there is such a big amount of ads. Oh yea, another thing. Id like how the bots sometimes hide behind a hill and move up so close to me that they hurt themselves by shooting at me like that‚Äôs how close they get. Id stands for I don‚Äôt btw I‚Äôve enjoyed this game but there‚Äôs a few problems that really keep me from giving this game four starsMy first complaint is the frost tank and it‚Äôs stupid frostbite move, I‚Äôm tired of going into multiplayer matches and losing to someone who thinks they‚Äôre good because they use the tank I like the move needs to be nerfed heavilyMy seconds complaint would be something to do with multiplayer as well, whenever you quit a match before it ends and you go into a new match there‚Äôs an issue where I‚Äôll die instantly, if this was intentional to reduce rage quitting then I respect the motive but not the outcomeMy third complaint has to do with the ads, I understand that since this game is free then ads are just guaranteed but good god is there a bunch, of you win a match, there‚Äôs an ad, if you lose a match you get an ad, if I want to unlock the chest I win after just watching an ad then I have to watch an ad and sometimes my screen will freeze to black from the ad and then I have to close the app and lose my reward from the game I just played, I feel like instead of after a match ends you should let us watch the ad to get the chest but still have the option to skip the reward if we don‚Äôt feel like watching the ad or if we can‚Äôt gain the reward due to being onlineI really wish I could give this game a five star but these three factors keep me from giving it five stars but other than these the game‚Äôs been extremely enjoyable. Update: GLITCHES GLITCHES AND MORE GLITCHES. I never win a reward after a match because it goes to a black screen which forces me to close to app. So no reward is ever given when I do that after I win a match. Most problems just need updates but will be deleting this and never looking back if they don‚Äôt fix it soon. It‚Äôs been going on for too long.  When this app is open my new iPhone XS Max gets very hot and eats up my battery more than any other game or app I have ever used. There may just need an update but it‚Äôs pretty bad and has been like this since I downloaded the game a few days ago. Other than that it would be a 5 star game if they did not force you to watch a video after every game. We already, willingly, press to play videos for (because we have to) to open the ‚Äúfree chests‚Äù to get upgrades. I just think we watch enough videos even without being forced to watch them after each and every game. AND for some reason these advertisement videos are longer when relating to how other game apps are. This games advertisements are usually around 30seconds each. That‚Äôs a long time! We get the point in 15seconds so these could be cut in half so we could at least watch 2 different 15 second videos that way this app can make more money playing more advertisement videos. After 15seconds it just gets annoying and even if I think the game looks cool that they are advertising I won‚Äôt download it because of how obnoxiously long their trailer is. Hi there!

They turned out to be too big after the system update and takes up to half of the screen. Hope this could be fixed soon. 1. The Bluetooth multiplayer won't connect. All DoTEMU SNK games with ""Bluetooth multiplayer feature"" do not work.... And they do not update or fix this problem.2. The Achievement, the one which you should get after playing with all of the characters... Is broken. I've played with all of the characters but I still haven't gotten it. 3. The controls is problematic and pathetic  at times, and it's unfair that certain characters' SP moves are very few in comparison to others. I honestly believe that SNK should find another company who will port their classic arcade games on the iOS or on other mobile platforms because DotEMU is not reliable. A couple of good things that I can say about this game is that it's my favorite KOF game and that you can really adjust the difficulty (like make it easy) unlike KOF97 and Samurai Shodown II (which I will not recommend anyone to buy because it's unenjoyable to play). I was not expecting to like the touch controls as much as I did. This is the first fighting game on a mobile device I have enjoyed. Very thought out port, you can tell dot emu put a lot of time into it and it paid off. Worth every penny at $3.99 considering that would only get you 8 plays in an arcade (if your lucky).

I am not the only person that would love this game more if there were a few more courses, a couple new powers, and things were changed up occasionally to keep it fresh. *Old review below*Great game. Could work on the physics of the game to fix some glitches and inconsistencies in play. But a great way to get a quick play in during some downtime.. Or sit around killing time playing and chatting with your friends. Some features that would be nice:1. Let people choose if they wish to be rematched, and randomly assign who goes first. Rather than letting the winner go first. 2. Fix the physics so that bounces off of walls are more consistent. Why do I sometimes get stuck to a wall when I run into it, instead of bouncing off of it?? Makes no sense. 3. Give us some updates. A new special power. A new map or two. There are other things. But those are the big ones. DD2 was probably the biggest disappointment of my phone game history.Everything that is terrible with mobile games today is present in it. To be fair, the game probably would have been fun, but I‚Äôll pass with the over the top ad blasting.Very thankful they left this one be. Many people who left the original for 2 are now back playing the original.I know the developer would never add anything else to this one but it‚Äôs a shame. So many people coming back now that they have had enough of modern day version of typical app games.

It only took me about an hour to finish, and I don‚Äôt even know the backstory. It would be nice to know the backstory and have some more playability.

It‚Äôs a Unique game and art Style. The music is sometimes pretty good. I only have 2 complaints. One is the glitches. Some times the game will freeze up, and sometimes it won‚Äôt save some levels you beat. That can get old really fast. And the second complaint is the is the Coins. My god the Coins. Finding the last coin on a level is the most annoying thing in the world. The coins Sparkle should be a lot bigger than what it is. And there should be more to do with them. Like Costumes for giant and people. Or something lol. But besides that I don‚Äôt regret buy the game at all. I had a feeling a lot of people would be leaving negative reviews because they‚Äôre salty about actually having to pay game devs for their work. But this game is worth every penny. It‚Äôs funny, entertaining, and progressively more challenging. The graphics are great and really refreshing compared to a lot of stuff out there at the moment. Overall, just really well visually designed. It‚Äôs the kind of game that could work well under a freemium model, but I‚Äôm glad they haven‚Äôt done that. Would love some sort of option for a zen mode in the future. ","Sticky Bodies, Q-Games Ltd., Games, Simulation, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

‚ÄéHigh School Simulator 2018,Please enjoy high school life in Japan. You can customize boys and girls. 2018 version improves the quality of school and students.,https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/94/f4/84/94f48415-7209-b919-e7be-a33fb63b3dc9/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-85-220-0-9.png/1200x630wa.png,High School Life in Japan,3.8 ‚Ä¢ 9.6K Ratings,Free,#181 in Action,"March 29, 2019","I really enjoy this game. I love the use of the models from Unity Assets. The hair style collection is nice as well. I do have a few recommendations. The club leaders don‚Äôt do much. They just stand there and you can‚Äôt do much other than kill them or join their club. Maybe create more classrooms so that they can have classes and be programmed as normal students? Also, their outfits are kind of odd. Just make them wear the same school uniforms as everyone else! I like the addition of the clerks and store managers, but they don‚Äôt really do much either, just stand there. Maybe give them something to do? And maybe get students to visit the stores and stuff during lunch ours and after school. The students themselves are very robot like, only moving to class and lunch. While you can interact with them, it‚Äôs very minimal. Maybe have them interact with each other? This goes for teachers too. I am happy that teachers are now more active, as they didn‚Äôt do much at all before. Add student lunches, and maybe a seat for the player. And give the students activity! They really don‚Äôt do anything while in club hours, just stand there. Also, I think I speak for most players when I say that we need a house, since we could start in the house rather in front of the school. And maybe give other students and teachers homes as well instead of having them spawn outside a very large tunnel. I‚Äôm happy with the improvements this game has gotten. Keep up the good work! So when I downloaded this game it was pretty nice my brother told me about it and that you can KILL people and there‚Äôs blood?! That‚Äôs not kid friendly. at all. I‚Äôm only 10! Please make this app kid friendly my brother is literally only 7- I get the app is rated for such a high age but like- still killing people is not good! Please fix this app to kid friendly. And that it‚Äôs starting to get boring it needs updates!! And the police car is OUT OF CONTROL I was driving it and it‚Äôs just way to fast! Pls make it slower!! And pls add more clothes choices and other acc for characters! And please let players enter the other buildings other than the school and house and other things. Now, here are things that are good about it. The app is quite creative and fun. How you get to role play as a anime character (I‚Äôm a personal anime fan myself) and it‚Äôs cool! I like how there‚Äôs not just your house and the school, how there is a whole town! It‚Äôs pretty cool! I recommend it if your an anime fan and just want to see what it‚Äôs like! This is a note for parents, if your child is an anime fan, and their 10 or younger, please don‚Äôt let them play it because there is killing and fighting and shooting guns. You may let them play it if they don‚Äôt get involved with the killing stuff. It would mean a lot if you responded ! Thank you! Have a wonderful day üôèüòÅ Ok the school isn‚Äôt really interesting all the classes are the same and in clubs you can‚Äôt do anything but it‚Äôs swimming you swim -.-  I wish the school had just something anything on the walls it‚Äôs more like a prison than a school it places. The bathrooms are just quickly put together there aren‚Äôt even doors or a sink it‚Äôs not really  decorated it‚Äôs just some bricks and a toilet I wish there were goals like kill this person or somthing. I don‚Äôt know what yen is used for other than buying drinks     Also they students are so robotic they go from class to class it‚Äôs almost creepy how they ALL walk or run in unison with 100 kids it‚Äôs just unsettling to me at least. The principal doesn‚Äôt do anything you can say hi or bye but that‚Äôs all besides killing him. Same with the club leaders they stand there you can join there club but that‚Äôs really it. I wish you could costomisethe students as you can yourself and the guy you can change there outfits but that‚Äôs it.           I wish there was somthing more to do other than kill people that‚Äôs it there no goals or anything. GOALS NEED TO BE A THING or multiplayer or something it‚Äôs boring you don‚Äôt do anything if u kill somebody they don‚Äôt respon so u run out of people really quickly aswell ","High School Simulator 2018, tomoya sugikami, Games, Action, Simulation, Entertainment, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

I never did anything else. My boss fired me for not going to work, my wife left because I forgot to pay attention to her, and I lost my house because I forgot to pay my bills. My parents disowned me for not doing anything and just playing. My dog died because I forgot to feed him and I ate him because I didn‚Äôt have money to do anything else. I spent the money my parents left me on this game. The high tech graphics of this game made me fell in love with one of the characters. I love this game. This is a game most people probably only play on the toilet at work so I didn‚Äôt expect depth or complexity from it but even for a toilet game from very early on it becomes obvious it is all just a money grab. the opponents start slapping perfectly on every single turn starting right after the first match. The opponents also very quickly start doing FAR more damage than you with each slap which means you lose every time you make even a small mistake which takes a lot of suspense driven fun out of the game and makes the slap meter feel pretty pointless. Coins earned in game can level the playing field by providing boosts but boosts are only temporary and cost far more than you stand to earn which means you will very quickly find yourself watching endless amounts of ads or spending dollar after dollar on coins just to progress further.  Honestly it‚Äôs a standard .io style toilet game money grab that‚Äôs a little less intrusive with ads and a little more demanding of cash. Nothing more nothing less. No depth no complexity, take it for what it is. However making it so difficult to progress or even play the game correctly without watching 10 ads or spending $10 gives it one of the lowest ratings a toilet game can get The game is pretty fun and simple but it‚Äôs completely 100% built around apps. I mean you don‚Äôt have to pay anything, actually I don‚Äôt think you have an option to. But to actually progress and win you basically have to watch a 30 second app to win every match and another 30 second app to increase your earnings for that match. If you don‚Äôt do this, your opponents increase in health and strength and you can‚Äôt possibly keep up unless you‚Äôre watching these apps.Unfortunately it‚Äôs the same 4 or 5 apps over and over and they‚Äôll just drive you crazy!!! I mean I get it, these games have to make their money somehow so I don‚Äôt blame them. It‚Äôs a funny and entertaining game and they never false advertised. So for that I give them 3 stars for perfectly implementing their ads on a fun simple game. But I find all these ads very annoying and too necessary to be able to enjoy the game.

The first time I‚Äôve heard of it is when it was automatically downloaded on my device. At first I didn‚Äôt think it was a good game, but when I went to see it, I found out I‚Äôve been wasting my time not playing this game. Now there‚Äôs a sequel to it. Pogo cat is one of my favorite cats, it‚Äôs a cute one and it‚Äôs a great meatshield in true form. This game is so cool, but I just wish that it was more exciting. Can there be enemies you can jump on to get extra rewards, and can there be a new enemy after each 5 or 10 levels. That would make the game a lot more exciting, even though pogo cat is free from all the battles -_-. Sry pogo cat üòÖ. Anyways great game and keep updating it :p :). It is an above average game (mobile game wise at least) in my opinion. It is not nearly as good as battle cats, but you will find yourself constantly just wanting to try one more time over and over. It can burn time quickly and from what I have saw doing missions in the game can give you cat food in battle cats so it is also rewarding. I would takes this over any type of voodoo copy paste game that have infested the app store. It kind of feels like your playing a battle cats minigame because it does so we'll keeping the battle cats mood. Im gonna continue playing it and hope this game also gains traction, definitely not deleting this anytime soon. Thanks for another quality game ponos. I know ponos hasn‚Äôt worked in this game in a long time but I think I would like to see new platforms like one that may moves side to side. Next I want new moves such as when you are in mid-air you can swipe down to jab down super fast. also I want to see enemies (the jab could be used to hurt defeat them) maybe one stays in place and jumps up and down (maybe even on a pogo stick) and one that moves back in forth in the air flying and lastly ones you can‚Äôt kill that let you jump higher BUT it will remove your second jump also if you get hit by an enemy you die. Lastly I want to be able to pick what ability you upgrade. (Also maybe levels and different backgrounds like a cave or mountain or a beach) ","Go! Go!

If you do play this game you will not enjoy it because you get an add after every mini game which takes about 15 seconds. To avoid this I thought I‚Äôd try and buy the remove ads pack, well actually I tried twice. Both times it took my money I checked my bank account and I did not get the benefits. Waste of 7 dollars and then when you try to restore the purchase there is no way to contact support only a menu that says that there is nothing to restore for you. This game is scamming people out of their money. Fraud game needs to get shut down. I love this game so much!!! At first i thought that it was just this little fighting game but then i came to realize that it was a mix of so many different types of games. People keep saying that there is so many ads but honestly      I think that you can just turn off your cellular data and your WiFi. I love this sooooo much because it‚Äôs sooooo addicting!!!!!!!!

Through the graphics, different levels and more this game is overall a fun one. I definitely recommend it! However, this game is not as fun as the original, ‚Äúsnowboard party‚Äù that game is more fun, and easier to get new levels (in my opinion). I completely recommend playing both games! Another update:One level is impossible to get the ‚ÄúY‚Äù because nothing happens when you hit it. Another level asks to get 20 snowflakes but there is never more than 13 at a time. They slowly seem to be fixing issues but it‚Äôs a little frustrating. They were able to give me the prize boxes that were purchased and lost which is appreciated. Bumped up to 3 stars due to continued gameplay glitches. Me again... recent update wiped out all of my progress and forced me to start over. Very frustrating. Had all but 2 tracks unlocked, stats all at 50 or greater, and all is lost. Used a gift card to purchase boxes and boards... all gone! Update again: most recent update crashes game upon launch... Update: response from developer stated the issues would be fixed with the most recent update... still not fixed. Lowered to 1 star.Pretty disappointed. Too many glitches. Impossible to collect the amount of stars needed as they don‚Äôt have as many as needed to complete. Constantly need to restart the game because ads freeze. Trick needed is 2x Grab and I couldn‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve tried to figure this out to no avail. I‚Äôve played every snowboard party game and was pretty excited for this one but it‚Äôs getting to be unplayable.. Hey Effmlb - Brian from Maple Media here. Thanks again for the updated feedback! I understand your frustration, and we're tackling these bugs as quickly as we can. With any new game release, little things arise that need some attention and this is no different. Please hang in there with us while we continue to improve the product. In our next update 1.0.3, expect to see the bugs with objectives being unclear, difficult to complete...etc cleaned up. We're doing another few runs of testing to make sure that we didn't overlook anything. We also know that there are improvements to be made to the box opening system, and those should be cleaned up as well. It may take a couple updates to get this right, and it's feedback like this that makes it possible so thank you. Hope you continue to play and enjoy the game! This version of SBP sees some changes but none that make it any better than previous No more live play with other players. Recycled levels with the same old obstacles... how about some super huge drops? Or super long rails? Or maybe some crazy jump ramps? No, it‚Äôs all the same. I unlocked and beat every level with my player‚Äôs stats at half filled and never really upgraded my board. Now what? I said I beat all the levels, except for a few achievements ‚Äúcollet this many stars‚Äù... you can‚Äôt because there are not enough of them. Perform a 380 ft slide, the only places to do it on that level kicks you off the rail. Lots of glitches in regards to board slides. Recycled boring glitchy. Maple is running this into the ground. Hi Black Sabbath Army, Thanks for your honest review and we really appreciate the feedback. What other ways could we make Aspen more challenging and fun? We're still working on the glitches and trying to catch all the bugs. It'll take us a few updates but we hope to really incorporate as many suggestions as possible to Aspen to improve the game.

As you rise to take your father‚Äôs place as ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no mistake ‚Äì this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for survival.  Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red. It‚Äôs charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle, giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to carry them out in the heat of the moment. It‚Äôs accessibly deep, with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans. Keep fighting, warriors.

Command troops of archers, swordsmen, and more as you protect a chain of islands from marauders, but one wrong move can prove costly. Tense, slick, and stylish, Bad North is a heady blend of tactical combat, strategic planning, and intuitive controls. You basically just deploy units to fight off invaders. That‚Äôs it. I appreciate the design of the game and that you have to think strategically about where to move which units, utilize terrain, etc. but after a while it gets a little boring. It would be great if the combat was just one part of the game, and players would also have to manage resources and defenses of the islands themselves. Taxation, revenue, fortifications, economies, trade ‚Äî these could all be used to impact success. It would make the game much more complex, interesting and re-playable. I‚Äôd even pay more for that. Also, I‚Äôm experiencing reload issues; the game kept hanging while islands were being generated at startup. I deleted my game and tried a new one, but that didn‚Äôt work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled. We‚Äôll see... This game is one of my favorite games ever. It had strategy that seems so complex yet so simple. It brings real challenge compared to these easy games I‚Äôve gotten tired of. The game does however need some work. Graphic glitches are all over the game. Not to mention that several save files have been ruined because it won‚Äôt let me load any levels past 50%. Ignoring the bugs I must continue to the actual struggling mechanics. The first one is the plunge ability. It poses nothing really. And it is the last thing I buy. I think the idea is great, but you don‚Äôt ever get the opportunity to use it. I think plunge should increase the overall attack and movement speed of the infantry units for a short duration of time after activating the ability. It also should have only a 10 second cool down as it should be something more used. Also items  are lackluster. I mean 8 items only. I expected at least 15.

As you chomp through a never-ending grid of dots, fruit, and multi-colored ghosts, a creeping glitch pushes you ever forward. Fortunately, a slew of upgrades‚Äîfrom lasers to bombs‚Äîwill help you demolish ghosts and forge a new high score. It‚Äôs a lovingly assembled package that‚Äôll delight both arcade aficionados and casual gamers. I love Pac-man. I always thought the classical frenzy would be my favorite, yet this twist, is amazing. It starts easy and gets harder, yet in a more frantic way. The power ups, power pellets, fruit that Pac man eats and gets more points than normal for a duration, and 256 dot-chains that destroy all ghosts on the screen, are all incredible. Also it is cool that the PAC dot chains are 256 of them since the original PAC man had 256 levels then was supposed to end, although I don't know how anyone is supposed to be that, which made the original fun as well. If I could make one suggestion, although this game seems to be perfect and I understand if it doesn't get added, is I would love to see the ability to upgrade fruits. Thank you for reading and I love this game so much! Once you've collected everything the only replay value is competing for 256 chains. I'm in the top 400 now and that's the only reason I keep playing. There are terrible bugs with the pac-dot chains. About 1 out of 5 times you eat a powerup it breaks the chain. I've lost many dozens of 256 chains because of this. Going the wrong way on the ""fast"" arrows usually breaks the PAC-dot chain. If the game lags at all then that breaks the PAC-dot chain. They need to have a better method of figuring out when the chain is broken besides timing based. However the powerup bug is the worst. Trying to level up all the power ups in this game is a huge joke. I have maxed out the main 3, but now that they increased the max level to 12 there's no way a person will play or pay to max out all 20 power ups. And that is one of the achievements - the final one I need - is having maxed out all power ups. It would cost hundreds of dollars if you actually paid for coins to do it. So they've really broken the cost / value ratio of this game, and that's made it impossible to get all achievements unless you want to spend an insane amount of money.

You can choose a name for your truck, but there needs to be more options for the names. In my opinion the best trucks and modifications are those that can only be purchased with Gold. It costs a lot of Gold to get these and it is very difficult to get the Gold Coins. You get them by placing in the top of the leader standings of the Season races, this is hard to do. You can watch a video to get one of these gold coins but most of the time the videos are not available. The last way to get the Gold is to purchase them with a credit card, but I don't have that kind of money, and that is the reason for 3 stars since you can't give half a star. If the Gold wasn't so hard to obtain then this would be a 5 star rating. So if you want to go all the way to the top of the leader boards in Season races for that big reward, be aware that it is very challenging but also very fun at the same time.Have Fun and Good Luck! Love this game add I just ran across it the other day. I started with you guys later release mmx hill climb 2 and loved it at first but the canyon stage got it deleted. Back to this release, I've literally stopped playing csr2 because of it and will eventually put add much money into it if you guys can give us an update. We need more options on the trucks, tuning etc. More customizing and more things to be purchased with cash or fewer gold's. The thing I love especially is that I can play off line and build my trucks up, but the issue I'm having as of late is where we start and finish a MP race online and it just freezes, I have to force close the game and come back. The record is accurate as I haven't lost but I hate that one inconvenience. Love the graphics! Enjoyable, yet challenging! With a little patience and fun racing challenges you can upgrade your vehicles without spending lots of money. The Support staff is helpful and does their best to answer your questions quickly, unlike so many others games. Only problem I‚Äôve had is the program crashing in the WWF mode.

For example in mission of the ‚Äúold pirates secrates‚Äù u must give them 10k to stop chasing and there is no option for u to not to and end it by force.- also adding more states of the relationships between u and other kingdoms would be good because it gets boring just going around the map in every location freely. For example if u have really bad relation ship in specific kingdom u will be chased and will have to fight them or escape using some kinds of artifacts (which i hope will be added).- and lastly i would love if u could attack ports and be able to capture them making it ur investment and defend it from attackers. Which than u could supply with guns and ammos and materials which would be late game but still possible. Definitely the best pirate-themed game for the iPad (by a large margin).  Picture it as a very polished Sid Meier‚Äôs Pirates! but with 25x the missions, stronger graphics, a fantastic score and 100% less redundant ballroom dancing.So why only 4 stars instead of 5?In a word: land.  This game has about a half dozen land quest types (they rotate randomly).  And its during these quests where the polish is tarnished.  A prime example: on a mission to save an Emperor‚Äôs daughter, you run to a pirate haven to save her. Often, the haven doesn‚Äôt render until you‚Äôre in the middle of town where you promptly get blown apart or trapped in geography.  Likewise, some trees don‚Äôt render and you‚Äôll get stuck on them.  Perhaps the most common issue is the camera panning 180 degrees in the opposite direction of a fight because of some object behind you that you‚Äôre stuck on. Additionally, your pirate will move a bit oddly through the land missions as if on rails (randomly). If the developers could fix the issues with land quests (giving them the same polish as the vibrant sea battles), this game would be an easy 5 star winner and one of the best games on the iPad. UPDATE: With the newest update, my expectations have, indeed, been exceeded! 3rd person boarding and land missions are absolutely bonkers! Been on since day 1 and I hope this game NEVER dies! ORIGINAL:Supremely bummed to see my original review missing :( .   Anywho- this awesome pirate game is the best all-round free-roam pirate action RPG on the App Store! At first glance, simple mechanics and mission chasing are abound!      However, what most fail to see is the actual depth of the game. For starters, it's a social game that allows you to play with other people cooperatively or anonymously. You can also upgrade your crew AND captain. There are mysteriously powerful artifacts to find, mythical sea monsters, and a budget for all of it..so venture wisely. Otherwise, the graphics and camera angles matched with the realistic sounds give this game movie-like qualities...just zoom in on deck and sail for a while with your friends, it's a blast! Then cooperate in pirate battles...it's a literal blast!    Sixth Star!!! The 6th star goes to this game because the developers have gone above and beyond providing excellent customer service.

The game is kind of like if overwatch and fortnite had a baby that was much more interesting to play. So what is the number 1 thing all fps players love? Cosmetics, something this game will offer for free in daily login  challenges and the season pass itself (even if you don‚Äôt pay). But what if you want to buy the season pass and your parents say no? Just save up, the free season pass will also offer the in game currency as a reward along with the login thing (which comes in generous amounts, but it would still take some time to save up for). I think as long as they reward people who level up their pass with decent rewards everyone is happy. I like the different game modes especially ranked, even though the randoms on my team give me a headache- it‚Äôs still fun and challenging. I await for the new features the devs add!

So I hopped on this game thinking it was going to be another fun 5v5 fast paced arcade game to pass time and have fun. The first couple of games I noticed how off the controls and sensitivity are and how the fire modes have horrible aim on all sensitivity‚Äôs (no it‚Äôs not me, I played plenty of first person shooters and never have the issue with aiming.) when shooting it accelerates horribly and slowly even on the highest setting and goes faster at the worst times, it‚Äôs unbalanced. The game is also rigged, TDM goes up to 20 kills however the game ends in the end and you can notice that the other team doesn‚Äôt even have over 10 kills, meanwhile your team has 20 deaths because of bugs in the game that auto drain health (no I am not being shot by anyone because the other team is dead and respawning by this time, I run around many corners in hopes to get away but the bug just zaps my health.)  also the characters are HIGHLY unbalanced. The tank has high health which you have to unload two clips into him, but his weapon does so much damage that your only choice is to unload a clip, run and heal and hope that he‚Äôs a bot and hasn‚Äôt changed positions. Overall I don‚Äôt recommend this game in its current state and hopefully it improves somehow. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a one star is because it‚Äôs not a bad game, it just needs improvements. It‚Äôs like any other 5v5 fps, it just has too many bugs to Mark it as ‚Äúfun.‚Äù First off I love the game it‚Äôs really good I see nothing wrong with the game I literally play this game everyday nice work. Now things that should be added to this game to make it better and more fun 1. Y‚Äôall should add crouching, jumping, and either slide or jetpack. This should be added so that in battle is easier to take cover and to get to a safe spot. 2. Having the ability to change characters in game. I wish that this was a thing because if your in battle and you wanna use a different character you can‚Äôt So please add that. 3. Add more modes. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong tdm and domination (zone capture) there fun but you should add different modes and events. 4. Friends list and multiplayer private rooms. Now this made me a little sad that y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt add these but please do cause there are many times when I wanna play my friends and can‚Äôt do it. 5. Gun camos. This is nothing major just a little something to spice the game up. Yea that‚Äôs about it all y‚Äôall need to do is add those things in and it will be goodüëç. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

Then yesIf you like tower defense games... I think it's a yes too but a little more dynamic than you are used to.... Imagine relocating towers sometimes and that's kind of a good comparison.Like, it's not a walk in the park... But ... Here... Whe. You start, note that your money is coming from an oil drill platform and you need to build ... Turrets? Lol mini tower defense... Basically arm your command center and your oil.. Got to guard that cash flow... And note the oil does run out... So you need to find mor oil and protect it all the way home to the command center. LEt me see... A bunker, a cannon, a rocket launcher... A oil drill, a depot for ammunition... That's mostly everything.. You need to use the oil to get money to make stuff to protect your oil... Go it? Lol.... I toss more ga Es than I ever actually get into and play.... This is one of those games where hours can pass and you walk away like..dam... What should I do next time.. Lol. It's cool This game is simple, has 3 towers, oil truck and oil refinery you need to defend, has upgrades as well but doesn't say what the difference of them do, some are obvious but ""income"" and ""resources"" I'm afraid which to use because I don't know what they do and you get a little amount of skill points each level. And no purchase in game, once you buy it there's no other purchases after which is great!Downside of why I'm giving it 3/5 stars is because there's no campaign, very little towers (3 to be exact), no game types, one map, unknown enemy spawn (I hate that) and meh sounds. Make a second one with more towers and more game types with not so annoying oil running out so fast and I'll easily pay $2-$3. Nice if you don't mind these small things. UPDATE: played the game and found a little ""glitch"" where an infantryman shot at the oil rig and I was able to repair it and he just kept shooting it, during that all my guys got oil. Then what I did is put a bunch of Rockets around my base and see how long I will last and ended up running out of money because oil spot runs out of oil and I got to wave 23 I feel like I've beaten in the game.. Fast paced game that will keep you on your toes! Simple game play with some upgrades to weapons. I would love to see ability to keep upgrading weapons to higher levels to combat the additional abilities of the bad guys in later waves. I am a fan of your games, keep up the good work!!!

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Looney tunes in my childhood, but this game makes me change my mind. It‚Äôs gameplay is good, it‚Äôs super competitive, and it is extremely addicting to play.,which leads to problems.I‚Äôm going to talk about the in-app purchases in each in game currency to tell the developers to fix these things, or they will ruin the game. The coins are no problem, they can be earned super easily. The ?illudium?‚Äôs purchases are ridiculous. They cost about 100 gems for 2 illudiumÔºÅIn perspective, you can spend 5 energy to get 2 illudium and a bunch of other items! The developers must be drunk when designing this market. Change this please!The energy system is way too expensive and way too little. I have to wait for like 2 hours to play it again. Maybe the energy cap raises as you level up? This way more people will play it. The daily tickets are fine, but I wish there would be more places to get them. The golden tickets...no, I am not spending any money on them, they are simply a place for new players to spend their money. Seriously, 200 gems for ONE golden ticket? I will never buy that.I seriously like this game, but it punishes free-players(including me) for not spending 50 dollars on some golden tickets. I‚Äôm sorry to see this game be like this, so please change these features! Sadly but not surprisingly, greed ruined another potentially amazing free to play game. The art and animation are wonderful, and it‚Äôs a really fun concept. Unfortunately, the free to play overlords in the company want your wallet more than your praises. I don‚Äôt like free to play models, but I accept them. This game, however, has only been out 2 weeks and is already geared for whales (big spenders). It uses special events (holidays, etc) as an excuse for you to spend more money rather than giving you much free stuff (what other free to play games do). Sure you can earn some, but they also offer tons of rewards you can‚Äôt possibly earn without paying real money. There is literally no way to reach them otherwise. And the gems you can earn for free don‚Äôt go very far at all. Everything you need in game currency for is way too expensive. I have paid money in other games with a much better rewards system, but I will not be spending a dime on this one unless something changes. And for a game that revolves around brawling with other players, it does a pretty terrible job at pairing you with a fair match most of the time. I may keep playing a little longer to see if the devs are listening, but for what could have been amazing, I feel pretty disappointed. Two stars, one for the animation team and one for the designers. None for the bigwigs who are way too greedy for a game that just came out. Great concept, wonderful characters, fun and addictive gameplay. However, store is a disaster as everything is way overpriced. 300 gems for 5-100 pieces of a character, cmon. At least 300 gems for most store items most of which you can get for free just by playing. In lower levels hundreds of trophies means a difference in your battles, but at higher levels I‚Äôm at least 3000 trophies higher than opponents and lose more than I win. Ages no sense. Crate system is awful and extremely flawed. Went to work with 4 crates under an hour to open. Came back and all were stolen. You never get to attack an opponent with less than an hour on a crate yet somehow you always can lose them no matter how much time you have left to open them. Constantly try to start brawls, it loads and then tells you the crate is already open. Then why is it an option to fight that opponent? This happens a LoT! This game could be awesome. Look at all my complaints and I still give it 3*! Small side complaint, where are classic characters like Speedy, Taz, Tweety, Henery Hawk? Wile E and Roadrunner are special characters only which is fine but we have a few obscure characters but not all the staples. Loads of potential lots of aggravation at higher levels. Just tired of losing to people thousands of points below me.

‚ÄéFOTONICA,"Ever wondered what running at 140mph feels like? FOTONICA is a first-person game about the thrill of speed and traveling flawlessly through complex environments.  One-handed controls: hold your finger down to run, release to jump, hold in mid-air to dive and land. FOTONICA is simple, but is not easy: it follows a tradition of arcade games that are easy to pick up and almost impossible to master. A multi-layered level design across eight different tracks, together with a procedural endless mode make for a game that is incredibly deep. Think you can outrun your friends? Try the split-screen versus challenges.  The visuals are a treat for the nostalgic player but also for those hungry for new aesthetics. Every pixel is drawn to convey the maximum sense of speed, an exhilarating journey through light and void. - 8 Levels to explore and master. - Plus 3 different endless levels to compete for high-scores. - Two-player split-screen multiplayer mode on the same device! - 18 Achievements to unlock plus game stats.  - Online rankings. - Beautiful, smooth, and unique vector-style graphics. - Electronic music by Michael Manning, Nicol√≤ Sala, and legendary composer Baiyon. - 2 Difficulty settings to let you play an even faster version of FOTONICA. - Play in landscape or portrait mode. - No ads, no in-app purchases. - Record and share replays of your best runs. -OTHER REVIEWS- POCKET GAMER - ""As good as competitive, hold-your-breath-every-second, first-person racing gets"" Chris Priestman, pocketgamer.co.uk ""EUROGAMER - 8/10 ‚ÄúUsain Bolt trapped in a feverish Tron daydream‚Äù Kristan Reed, eurogamer.net  "" ""GAMEPRO - 5/5  ‚ÄúThis one button game has a lot more mileage than you might expect‚Äù  Nathan Meunier, gamepro.com "" ""THE CREATORS PROJECT - ‚ÄúA veritable black hole to lose yourself in‚Äù  Emerson Rosenthal, thecreatorsproject.com "" ""ARS TECHNICA - ‚ÄúStriking and instantly impressive‚Äù Ben Kuchera, arstechnica.com"" ""ROCK, PAPER, SHOTGUN - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a remarkable game, and unlike anything else I‚Äôve played‚Äù  John Walker, rockpapershotgun.com "" -AWARDS- ‚ÄúFantastic Arcade Spotlight Game 2014‚Äù ‚ÄúEuroGamer Expo Selection‚Äù ‚Äú54th Biennale of Art in Venice Selection‚Äù ** FOTONICA is designed for iPhone 4 and above.

Me being a fan of games like Super Hexagon, WaveWave, and Boson X, this game is almost a dream come true! One thing that really bugs me, however, is that the timer and score at the bottom of the screen are hidden if you use your right hand to play! If the devs could put an option to swap the score and timers to the left side, that would make this game even more awesome than it is. I first found this game when the Ouya was new, and from the point of view of someone who can never find a good mobile game to play, I‚Äôve bought this on at least 3 different platforms, and should it eventually reach console, I‚Äôll most likely buy it there too. I don‚Äôt know what it is about this game that is so addicting, but the ‚Äò70s score-centered type of gameplay, combined with the high speeds you‚Äôd only experience drifting the touges of Mt. Akina, while still keeping the aesthetic of the game very simple yet very informative of what is happening around you... it‚Äôs something I have yet to experience through any medium. This game is a blessing, yet a curse - a reminder of what no other game has ever strived to achieve and probably never will again. So I literally just got this game to help out with my insomnia based off the simplicity of the design and animation type. So far I love it and the music is super relaxing, you can also play your own if you prefer that. The color hack I used was simple and it doesn‚Äôt require what your phone doesn‚Äôt already have. I use this also just to change the mood of my phone. Lol add smart contrast and reduce white point and you‚Äôll have a dope looking color scheme for all Apple stock apps.For this game Go to settings>general>accessibility>display accommodations[turn it on]>color filters>turn the intensity up> then change the hue to whatever color options you like. Once that‚Äôs done go back to the game and the white lines will now be filled with the hue that you chose for your phone.Quick tip:Enable accessibility shortcuts and triple tapping will make this so much faster to turn on and off once the hue is set.Hope you guys enjoy this game as much as I do! P.s- I‚Äôm thinking about doing a vlog on live app reviews using the new screen recording feature in the new iOS 11 update. Let me know if you enjoy this tip!

This is a free game, how are those reviews paid, sure the ads and iAPs are paid, but our 5-star reviews are better than you‚Äôre ‚Äúfake‚Äù 1-star, and the other haters too. This game lives up to Mr. Jump and is totally recommended if you can‚Äôt get Mr. Jump for $3. And P.S. this is not a geometry dash rip-off because that game is way challenging. This game is stupid fun, it has a perfect difficulty curve, and excellent level design. There is one flaw, however. The end points of a level are these small portal like objects. In some levels, it‚Äôs easy to jump over them. If this happens, you restart the level. In Level 11-3 it‚Äôs near impossible to not fly over the end point. This could be easily fixed by just making the hitbox to get into the portal much larger, to avoid cheap deaths.

I managed to (somehow) get about 700 trophies on this game, but it would be a lot easier if the other players you fight weren't all bots. The only way you can play with teammates that aren‚Äôt bots is if you manage to gather friends, but even then you‚Äôre always fighting against bots that usually don‚Äôt do anything.  Obviously taking a lot of inspiration from Supercell‚Äôs Brawl Stars, an app that I can gladly say is my favorite mobile game, Super Cats could have some great potential if it decided to separate itself from blatantly trying to be like other apps or famous characters, and try to implement a unique idea into their game. My favorite game is brawl stars so if a game copy it they should make it better and not horible. And it copys all the characteristics of the brawlers in brawl stars and 2 or 3 days happened to me that when I left the game and then enter again all my progress is not there. And to if you want to have the idea of an other game do not do all the same you need to do it better and have your own ideas and not copy all of the game. But I said this to MOBA games they need to improve in this because it copy almost all of brawl stars. And sorry if this get you mad but is the true so improve in this game because people will begin to annoy you with the very bad comments. So DO NOT COPY BRAWL STARS WELL YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF BRAWL STARS TO DO A GAME BUT DO NOT COPY ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BRAWL STARS please and am not saying at all that this game is ALL bad. And do not get mad with me please Like brawl stars but a bit different. I love the battle royale and would play it any day of the week over brawl stars showdown but thats about it all the only thing different about the characters in this game compared to brawl stars is the designs they function the exact same and also one map? Seriously? I‚Äôd rather have the map rotation in brawl stars.

The graphic and sound design are phenomenal, and the game itself is a blast. However, it does have its share of problems. Almost everything has a daily limit, and I feel this limit is too strict. Sometimes, it makes some sense with hunts and the portal, but there‚Äôs already an energy system in the game. Only being able to do each hunt 5 times a day is fine because there‚Äôs multiple hunts to do, and the portal because one doesn‚Äôt want the player to achieve all of the rewards so fast. However, I believe the limit system should be used for each individual favor, portal battle, etc. instead of a total limit. The current system is way too restricting and makes the game much grindier as one has to wait a day to do certain things. The limit system is sometimes fine on its own, however with the energy system it is ridiculous. The only time the two systems come together is for hunts which is fine, but the portal, monster cave (which I think the torches for entering are too rare), favors, and others shouldn‚Äôt be this restricting. I also believe the energy system should be a little faster. Other than that, good game. This is a fantastic game, hence everyone else‚Äôs responses, but I wish the hunts made sense. I just recently got into the game as I mean it just came out but it really seeps into the idea of pay to win. Which I mean you don‚Äôt have to but to get anywhere or progress you do, the weapon development//upgrading is already beginning to feel very grind-like (which I don‚Äôt necessarily mind) but the issue is it doesn‚Äôt pay off well. Even after referring back to hunts when progressing into the game 6 turns is ridiculous, I was even tempted to pay (which I don‚Äôt mind either but I don‚Äôt want to pay for something in which the money I spend is going to require me to end up spending kore to catch up.) all in all I love the game but it‚Äôs lacking the engaging experience of progression through earning and I feel like it falls short for that reasoning. I‚Äôm personally going to continue to play but just like clash royale eventually the money grab will get on my nerves and rather than wanting to pay I won‚Äôt pay at all. I needed a new mobile game in which I just hope these little issues can be reduced and the game could be one of the best games to be released on the App Store. I just hope the devs are actually listening and aren‚Äôt trying to monetize as bad as candy crush was. Godspeed and I hope the best for this game.üôèüèΩ Love this game so much that many ideas started sprawling everywhere in my mind, I have a couple of them or two. The first one is since I found out that there‚Äôs a samurai hero in this game and I love samurai very much here‚Äôs this: involve a far eastern part of the world of knighthood, where you can meet the different version of the knights of rage, why not put the samurai of virtue: they master the art of virtues and allows them to summon yokai from their sword called yokai-no-tsurugi. And the second one is one that could make anybody love it more is that they should involve before I say this well I know in many fantasy genre we are treated to dragon knights and all that, nothing personal about that so here‚Äôs one type of knight you would love, the Dino knights! Awesome idea right? I think that be amazing enough to have into knighthood. I mean I‚Äôm thinking about the Dino might rage gauntlet, Dino knight heroes, dinosaur type monsters and all, trust many dinosaur fans are going to love that so much without a doubt. So what do you think? Impressed? Intrigued? Amazed that such an idea came to mind? Cause let me tell ya, it amazed me too when that came to me.

Some are really well received, like fighterz, and others not so much. When I found out there was an official mobile dragon ball game I was sure that it would be a poorly made cash grab of a game. I was very wrong. While it is true that you can buy an in game premium currency in the form of dragon stones it is not completely necessary to buy them. They are quite accessible if you are willing to put in the time. I myself have only spent a small amount of money on the game and only when there is a big discount. Even without spending much money on it I have over 100 top tier characters and after years of playing I still have a lot of fun. It can be very grindy at times and there are some times in between events that can be really boring if you are high level and have most of the story stuff done. However there are almost always events of some sort going on and there‚Äôs almost always a new exciting character to summon for, seeing as that‚Äôs how the game supports itself. Overall it is a really fun game that gives a real sense of achievement when you finally beat a really tough event or grind to buy something big in the baba shop. Of all the dragon ball games created up to this point, it‚Äôs probably the one with the most work put into it and the most balanced of all. It‚Äôs really a good game and I highly recommend it to any dragon ball fans out there. Let's start out with the only bad thing here. It's Pay to win. Now that that's out of the way. Let's talk about all the good this game has to offer. Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle is a unique game with a very unique twist on the usual beat em ups. This is refreshing to say the least since most of us Dragon Ball fans are used to that formula for those games and the mechanic can either make or break the game. You collect these orbs that let you obtain ki for your ki meter that can be seen whenever you fight something. This game also comes with it's own story mode, can be completely f2p if the person so chooses (which is still viable to this day), and new things are added all the time. Sure, you can empty your purse of money into this game to get rare characters you want, however, the game already gives you plenty of dragon stones (this games Gotcha currency). Each of the story missions give you three stones and there are almost always events that give you special missions to gain more stones. I'd say it's worth it to grind a bit and earn a bit. It makes the experience of the game more genuine and fun. As a player myself that has trash luck, you can always make the best of your situations. That's why there are so many ways to play this game. And it's still being updated and modified! In my opinion, this is one of the best Dragon Ball games of it's time. Just look past that stamina issue... I‚Äôve been playing since the global version was released and have logged in 90% of those days since it was released. I‚Äôve seen this game grow into something great. Compared to other mobile anime summon type games Dokkan takes the other by a lot. You could spend zero money on this game and still have a great time, good characters, and enough stones to summon. The addition of a guaranteed SSR character on a x50 stone summon is huge and was the biggest step in the right direction. Also the inclusion of rates was huge too. When it‚Äôs celebration time either monthly or annually they give out honestly more than enough stones if you want to summon or save. This recent 5 year celebration has been the best yet and I expect to be better than the last each time. You could skip the monthly banners and save your stones because once the big annual celebrations hit you are treated to amazing summons with tickets, loads of stones, and content then you can summon on the banners and get the monthly Dokkan characters you missed. Lastly the coin system with 10 coins per 50 stone multi is monumental because it does push you summon more, but there‚Äôs an end goal in mind. Thank you Dokkan you have built memories, pasted time when bored, generated hype, and have created an amazing experience overall. I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs in store years down the line!

To start it off, the first issues is in the app and the game itself but I keep getting network errors so I‚Äôm guessing that they‚Äôre problems with the Ubisoft servers or something.  Can‚Äôt enter my Ubisoft account or whatever it is it asks to customize your dancer card within the app and I can‚Äôt access the online feature of the game itself.  The second issues is the weird one.  The first two smart phone devices work fine without many issues but all other devices that have been paired with game/console repeat the same issue of not showing up on the screen.  They produce sound effects when joining the game and show character selection after picking a song like all other devices but on the tv it won‚Äôt show their name or any sort of visual cue to their existence however when dancing it shows a third and forth bar going up as they dance but it won‚Äôt show their names at the top or let them know how they‚Äôre doing with each move like the other two.  And they also get a score at the end of the song and that‚Äôs the only proof of their existence on the ps4 side.  I hope for some update somewhere to fix this When I first got this game, the controls were working fine but the more I danced, it got worse. I get disconnected even in the middle of songs which is annoying if I am on the world floor. I am not able to get decent scores while using this app. One time I got disconnected then I reconnected, and 10 seconds after I got disconnected again! The worst part is that I already spent $60 to buy the game, and to get the Kinect is another $100 with an adapter of $60. I can not afford the Kinect so hopefully there is an update that fixes some of the bugs soon. It is also unfair to people who have a Kinect because it tracks both arm moments (thus earning more points) while the phone controller only tracks one arm. I've heard people complain about this before so hopefully the Just Dance company will make it fair for everyone. I really hope that this review is put into consideration for the next update. Thank you. Dearest Ubisoft and Just Dance developers,   I cannot express how impressed I am with this app. Its sleek, beautiful design and multiple features for sure make it a winner. I just have a few suggestions:1. Maybe regular Wii compatibility? I understand how old Wiis are, but maybe a more simple Wi-Fi signal output would do the trick, considering most Wiis can connect to Wi-Fi.2. Maybe the ability to change your avatar and name without signing in? I am I'm 6th grade and apparently ""everything matters""üòÇ I hope you consider those suggestions for the app. However, I do have a few more suggestions for Just Dance itself: (these are totally random and might not even be possible?)1. I know how much people love custom made things, so it'd be cool if you could come up with a custom dance. First, you could pick one of the premade avatars from the other songs.

I had it on my computer and once i saw there was also an app I of course downloaded it immediately. The only thing is I also have Burger shop 2 on my computer and I would love to see the Burger shop 2 app so I can play it on my phone as well. I've beaten #1 and #2 on my computer so many times but I just keep resetting them so I can playing again and again. PLEASE MAKE BURGER SHOP 2 AS AN APP!!! I played this game couple years ago and I love that it's on the iPhone. This is really the only food game I like cause all the others have boring art and add new menu items with no reason. This one lets you choose. Eventually you have em all but having a choice makes the game more entertaining. The dialogue and story in this game is also very fun and interesting. This game is so addicting and I love it so much! Perfect for anyone who's looking for a addicting game of even just a fun way to pass time!

The design is airtight, with seamless and consistent high-end pixel art that Nintendo themselves couldn't outdo. (Drop Wizard takes a lot of visual cues from the Kirby games, an obvious inspiration.) I love the main gameplay mechanic: it's fresh, but still has a familiar platformer feel. The characters and environments succeed one another in a very elegant way that allows you to pick up the game's ideas intuitively without rushing. Drop Wizard is PeRfEcT for mobile devices and seems truly designed with the platform in mind, not something I can say about many other developers. The music (and sound design!) is emotional and nostalgic, the art is thorough and detailed and cute, and the levels are clever and fun! One of my favorite iOS games to date. :-) Took a second to get used to the mechanics, but once I did it was really fun and addictive. Some people seem to dislike that the character is always moving, but to me that adds to the challenge. I mean, all you are doing is pressing 2 directions. The game needs a way to stay fast paced and I think maybe that is why they did that. Retro games were always tough and you would die a lot until you got the rhythm down. But that's what I liked about them. This game has that element to it, along with great retro graphics and 16-bit music. Is this up to par with a Super Nintendo game with the Super Nintendo controller? Of course not. But for a 99-cent iPhone game this is really quite great! Okay okay I love this game but the last boss is soooo hard I'm not saying that I'm going to get rid of it because I'm going to keep trying anyway when it gets to the final part in the last boss can u plz give us r HP back because the level is realy hard and when I have one ‚ù§Ô∏è left and when I beat the first part in the battle then he transform its realy heard so PLZ give us are hp back cause who ever heard of giving the boss ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è and u have ‚ù§Ô∏è or ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è game still great though.

Such as the updates, they could really be spaced out more.The good is that the replayablility is always high, you grind and find new combos to get the highest scores and it‚Äôs always a new challenge wherever you see fit. It does lag when you play it upon hours, though I feel like few face this problem since majority of us can‚Äôt sit on our phones playing this. However the designs and art of the cookies is always so beautiful and fantastic! Each set of personalities they have are always so cute and unique to their own, it adds a little bit more life to the game. Considering how the devs also try their very best to listen, there hardly is any loss to playing this game.Onto the bad that can always just be fixed.The amount of new cookies always catches me off guard since I barely get the other cookie to a decent level then I‚Äôm given more treasures and cookies to upgrade and I‚Äôm left in the dust.Also within the new update, I can‚Äôt load my previous sets of combis! In breakout mode, the sets are fine and there‚Äôs two options, the save and new option of ‚Äúcombi tips‚Äù. I can‚Äôt load the one I want, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúapply‚Äù option like there was before the update. I‚Äôve been in love with this game since the Kakao version and I‚Äôve seen it go through many stages. I‚Äôm proud to see it flourishing the way I always thought it deserved, but I‚Äôm sad to say that Ive dropped it. I‚Äôm sure the devs get hundreds of complaints everyday when they make slight changes to the game so before when I had a problem with new features, I‚Äôd just complain to myself and carry on trying to gain levels, but the recent changes are just to extreme for me to carry on, (I‚Äôm referring to the whole reworking of the treasure system). Like I said before I love Cookierun and have spent many hours playing the game, so when the new update came out I tried playing it on multiple occasions but since then, it just never felt the same. I never got back the same excitement when finishing trophy races or weekly breakouts as I did before and I was just left felt dissatisfied. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm used to playing it a certain way, I‚Äôm sure if the treasure system was always like the way it is now It would still be downloaded on all of my devices, but with the way it is now I can‚Äôt see myself ever re-downloading it. The changing if the treasure system doesn‚Äôt make it a bad game by any means and to those who‚Äôve never played it, I‚Äôd definitely recommend, but for veteran players like me who don‚Äôt get the same enjoyment out of it anymore I‚Äôd just suggest to drop it now while you still have good memories of it. Let‚Äôs get my one real complaint out of the way off the top: this game wants you to spend money on it so bad you‚Äôll think you‚Äôre in groundhog day with how many deals and bargains and packages you have to click away from. I seriously wish they‚Äôd tone it down. The only other bad thing I could say about it is strictly personal taste. I prefer simpler, procedurally generated tracks like temple run- being led around by the nose by a line of candy is a little hypnotic in a way I don‚Äôt personally enjoy. Everything else is fantastic. The character designs are adorable, they‚Äôre diverse and interesting where they absolutely could‚Äôve gotten away with not having any backstories at all, and there‚Äôs always something in this game to DO. I‚Äôve never reached a point in this game where I thought ‚Äòwell there‚Äôs nothing left to do today, better go do something else.‚Äô You stop when you feel like it and not a moment before. A complaint I HAD was that there wasn‚Äôt any benefit to spending a lot of time using one cookie, but the affection feature has changed that entirely, and now I really can‚Äôt think of anything in the actual game mechanics that isn‚Äôt solid.

I'm only level 5 but so far the game is awesome. There r skills unique to every character and some r amazing (one guy can even walk through walls). The gameplay is fluid and u have the freedom to do pretty much whatever u want as far as traversing the map goes. U can climb walls with grappling hooks, shoot through window panes, and even surprise enemies by dropping through the roof. Many pros to this game. A few cons, the auto fire and auto aim didn't seem to be working with makes it more difficult to hit targets. Another thing is at times it's a little difficult to differentiate between ur team and the enemy team because enemies health bar doesn't show up until they take damage. I've stood right next to an enemy thinking it was my teammate.  And lastly, characters with fully automatic weapons reign in this game as of now. Without auto fire and auto aim, it's incredibly hard to get kills with a semi automatic. But all in all, the game is definitely with the download and I could see it expanding and never getting boring. Download it. U won't regret it. The game is very well made like most people say it is very pay to win and there are a lot of try harder but I think if they add better team matchmaking and a really good skill based matchmaking or level based matchmaking the game would be pretty good. I wish they had more items to by in the store it‚Äôs like maybe skins or weapon xp tokens or something that you don‚Äôt have to spend real money on. The characters need better balancing the snipers need to be one shot and the DMRs need to be 3 shot minimum I should have to take three shots with a sniper to kill someone. The SMGs need a lower time to kill they are way to good. As a genuine fan of Super Mecha and Cyber Hunter, I‚Äôm massively disappointed in this latest release from NetEase. Anyone looking for a game to stand up to PUBG or Call of Duty mobile will be forgivably disappointed with Super Mech or Cyber Hunter, but Disorder is absolute garbage. Gameplay and NPC‚Äôs feel worse than an N64 game from 20 years ago. The art is cool and detailed, but I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt use the same gameplay, engine and NPC from Cyber Hunter. Download it for yourself if you want a laugh, but don‚Äôt expect to get much more. COD mobile is the new standard and with NetEase being one of the largest tech companies out there, they should be able to dedicate resources to the Dev team to make progress not regress.

First, whenever you kill an animal an ad pops up. Normally I don‚Äôt mind ads but this add pops up vertically so I can‚Äôt exit out of it and continue playing the game I have to exit out of the whole game to get rid of it but by doing so the game sends me back to the home screen so I can‚Äôt bring my kill back to base to cash in on it, wasting my bullets and losing my kill. Secondly the game doesn‚Äôt let you climb over hills to spot the animal your trying to shoot  so you have to go around and by doing so scaring away the animal. I‚Äôve heard that some of the other players were having these problems as well and I hope you can fix them this is a really awesome game! Thank you for your consideration and I hope you are able to fix these problems. I was looking for a free roam hunting game with challenges. This game fits that description perfectly! It‚Äôs loads of fun driving around. Physics and everything seem to work great! This game would be an absolute hit, if two things were fixed. 1, the ads popping up after you pick up a kill are broken. I normally don‚Äôt mind ads; but they pop up vertically on a horizontal screen, so you can‚Äôt exit out of the ad and have to restart the game and you lose your kill. Kinda beats the purpose of the game. 2, you can‚Äôt walk up any type of hill. You should be able to walk around the entire map no problem. However, these issues were stated by someone over a year ago and they‚Äôre still not fixed, so I doubt they ever will be. Which unfortunately means I will be uninstalling this game. If you guys fixed these issues I would actually be willing to spend money on this game ","Hunting Simulator 4x4, Pavel Gavrilyuk, Games, Entertainment, Action, Simulation, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

Cubemen2 improves on its predecessor in just about every way, with new game modes, customizable unit types and styles, bigger stages with new teleporters and healing stations, and‚Äîbest of all‚Äîultra-competitive six-player cross-platform multiplayer. This thinking person's battle game is a standout experience on iPad. This is one of my favorite games to play for sure. I recently began to play it again and while it was just as fun as it was before, there are a couple of issues I want to bring up. 1. Mid-game character freezeSometimes as I play all of the characters on the map go sort of haywire: I can‚Äôt place anymore troops nor can I move any of my already purchased troops. This is somewhat annoying as this usually happens around the middle to the end of the game and I have to completely restart my match2. Network FailuresI‚Äôm not sure if this is a problem on my end or yours, but occasionally when I am hosting a game there is a network failure where everybody is disconnected and the game resets3. Sound in the gameWhile this isn‚Äôt a part of the 3 star rating, as I create maps I find the fact that the music is located ‚Äúin space‚Äù is somewhat strange. I only noticed this because if you move your perspective around quickly it sounds like the game is going crazy, whereas it is really only the music changing between speakers and decreasing or increasing in intensity as you move. I love the concept of the game and it is fun to play. I still would purchase the game at $2 even with the short comings. It is an indie game and so I have to give the devs props for making it this far. The app is buggy and will crash sometimes which is frustrating. I believe it stems from developing the game using the unity framework for multiple OS's. This is appealing as a dev to reach the biggest audience but I believe that we get spoiled on iOS and begin to expect that you will make games natively for apple devices. I would rather wait to play a less buggy game than get frustrated because you tried to launch availability to the whole world at once. Also I would love for the ability to host games locally for times when I want to play against friends in the same room but lack Internet access.All in all I love the game, love indie devs, but wish these guys didn't cut corners and instead developed a platform specific version for iOS.

This is the most honest and accurate descriptions I‚Äôve seen. The game is a true throwback to the NES days and done well. I do want the ability to retry levels, however, but as this would effect gameplay I can see the purists saying no...fine...it‚Äôs a draw. The only issue I have is that I‚Äôm right handed and the enemies generally come from the right. So I can either try it out on ‚Äúexpert mode‚Äù (using my left hand), or not always being able to see the enemies. I could get the controller that it supports, but I‚Äôm not going to. And I can‚Äôt imagine how he could fix it seeing as it‚Äôs a biological error in my part being right handed.This definitely left handed creator made a real gem here, buy it, share it, play it Reminds me of my favorite space shoot em ups from different computer platforms over the years.  Love that for a small price there are no advertisements and no in game purchases.  Game play is excellent, smooth response even when screen is filled with action. Normal and easy modes are both appreciated, it‚Äôs great to have the difficulty scalable for different levels of skill among my family members. This game is a perfect throwback to old school shoot em ups, with new twists, great levels, and great detailed retro artwork. This reminds me a lot of Dandara in terms of it being a high quality take on retro games. There‚Äôs an Easy mode and normal mode (which is really really challenging). I haven‚Äôt finished yet but I know I‚Äôm gonna want more levels by the end. Hopefully they make some more additions. Overall, highly recommend.

Key word there: was. This game hasn't been updated since October, and that was only bug fixes. I unlocked all of the characters and trails months ago, but you guys haven't added any additional ones since launch. The game gets really boring without a reason to play, and missions would really help. Maybe you could only unlock certain characters/trails from completing missions. I mean, it's not like you're out of New characters to add. Off the top of my head, I could think of Bobert, Alan, and Miss Simian (since they're in the opening cutscene). Also add characters like Mr. Robinson, Mr. Small, Juke, Sarah, Tina Rex, Jamie, Teri, Clayton, Dr. Wrecker (Rob), Granny Jojo, Marvin, Larry, Hot Dog Guy,  and some variations for Nicole and Richard. Okay so I love the game and all but the characters are just not like gumball. They barely look like the characters! Also when penny fights, she turns purple. ITS REALLY WEIRD!! You could add characters like the egg heads or the lego guys too. I don't really think you watched the show because the fighting and reaction are nothing, and I mean NOTHING like the show.

It is a standard left to right action game with similarities / flavors of older titles such as Ghost House for the Sega Master System or Phantom Fighter for the NES. It involves moving from 1 starting location to the exit (Usually a door) to complete SED level. At which point you proceed to the next level. Action is carried out by shooting your enemies with a hand gun.Graphics:Since this is a port of an older J2me title it has that 16bit visual feel all over it. (one of the reasons I was sucked in to buy it) The graphics do the job of giving you that Splaterhouse or Ghost House feel but only lightly and do not make use of any parallax or multilayer scrolling that is usually found in almost all true older 16bit games of this type during the late 80's and early 90's. Frames of Animation are decent for what there is and horribly lacking for what there isn't. Your walking animations and gun firing animations are cute enough but there is absolutely NO jumping animation! Your character just begins to hover up and to the right or left, and then land. What...??? Even your enemies display a decent amount of frames when provoked or die, so why the lazy programming. (we will get to that later).Sound:I was actually surprised in this department! There seems to be 2 short eerie tunes that switch each level and last about 10 to 15 seconds in length before repeating. Not bad if you consider that this is an older J2me port. Most didn't have any music let alone sound effects unless it was from a major company like Gameloft or EA. Even the sound effects shocked me considering the source material. They had well sampled gun fire and death sound for the enemies and weapons.Control:This is where it all begins to fall apart and show how much effort (or lack there of) was put into this Iphone port. In the move from the J2me format where only 1 button press could be recognized at a time to the Iphone, nothing was changed! You still can only use one action button or movement button at a time. We are still in 2009 right? We didn't all take a step to the left and go through the time warp again did we? This to me along with the lack of animation and cut and paste jumping that reeks of early cell phone games in NO way justifies the $1.99 they are asking.Conclusion:I was sucked in by the decent 16bit ish looking art and theme. DO NOT GET SUCKED IN AS WELL BY THIS TRAP! This is a very BARE bones direct port of a really old J2me cell phone game that takes absolutely no advantage of the Iphone's capabilities! That coupled with a $1.99 asking price is pure madness in this APP market. If there was a .50 app selection I would still not recommend it. Another example of a company suckering the good people on the APP store out of their hard earned money! Contrary to what has been written, I like it. I LOVE the spooky music!!! It's cool adds a really nice touch!! It's playable. It's a platform game, I'm biased to platform games, there's not enough here in the app store, and the graphics could be better, but it's pretty fun.

So, I urge the developers etc. to please fix this bug as soon as possible. As well as another one I encountered in chapter 3. So, in chapter 3 Boris is supposed to open the door to Alice Angel. However, he got stuck and wouldn‚Äôt move at an open door a few feet away from the one he was supposed to fix. By using the elevator and going to random floors and coming back, I was able to fix it. But it was still very annoying so please fix that too. Otherwise, the game is great and would 10/10 recommend. Ok so first great game I beat all five chapters in like 2 hours I have been hoping that bendy would come to iPhone I have been watching markiplier and jacksepticeye play it Ever sense it was released back in 2017 and been a fan of it ever since also I loved that you put in your little meatly cameos and that jacksepticeye and DAgames had cameos to! But now on to the bug so when I played the game again I was in chapter three and I got the tommy gun and listened to Henry‚Äôs secret audio log and and I got to the end the elevator wouldn‚Äôt move and now I have to restart my game so if you can fix that that would be great well in the words of Wally franks I‚Äôm out of here! Ok so I know I mentioned the elevator a couple months ago and this is kinda a stupid question but I was wondering if you could make a setting in chapters 1 2 and 3 Ware we could switch it to the old chapters back to the remastered chapters I know you guys are working bendy and the dark revival but if you guys could do that that would be awesome sorry to bug you also are you guys making bendy and the dark revival for the switch play station Xbox and phone like this one? Sorry got excited when the trailer came out I love Bendy. Having been a fan since chapter 1 first came out, I was delighted to see a mobile version now that the game has been completed. However, there seems to be a bug in chapter 3. I‚Äôve tried to play it multiple times, but because the level is so big, I don‚Äôt have the time to complete it in one sitting. This is no problem in chapters 1 and 2, since I can save and exit the level/game. However, this doesn‚Äôt work in chapter 3. I exit the game fine, but when I try to play it from where I left off, I end up stuck in the elevator with none of the buttons working and the doors closed. When I look at the objective, it says to take the pipe, plunger, etc. But I‚Äôm already holding the item. I end up having to start a new game completely, and after three or four times of this, it gets very tiring. I love everything else about Bendy, and since these kind of bugs happen to even the best developers, I‚Äôve still decided to give the game 5 stars anyway. (though I would still love it if you fixed this bug) ","Bendy and the Ink Machine, Joey Drew Studios Inc., Games, Action, Adventure, Entertainment, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

It takes so long it gets boring in my opinion, then you have guild battles and you can't never participate because the game doesn't load off the guilds who haven't been on in like 89 days. I've been trying to join or create a guild but it's not happening. Don't get me wrong this is a excellent game if you want time consumption but work more than one job you won't have much time at all. Plz fix these issues I greatly appreciate it. It has major potential if they get it right. If you can make a newer version with the camera right behind the player and more options than just one button too attack with staff you could charge for it plus fix these other issues my other players have complained about. Thanks a bunch. Since April 7th/8th 2020, I haven‚Äôt been able to get past the ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù portion of the loading screen on startup. I was hoping it was a quick fix on GL‚Äôs part. Checked the support page and did everything that they suggested (and more) to try and resolve the issue myself to no avail. I thought, ‚Äúalright, I‚Äôll submit a ticket to customer care and they‚Äôll fix it.‚Äù It‚Äôs nearly been a week now and I haven‚Äôt gotten an answer aside from the automated message that tells me to do the same things I‚Äôve already tried several times. I had purchased a few packs to help out with the (then) upcoming guild war and Easter egg hunt event; only to find that I can‚Äôt take part in either of them. I have to say I‚Äôm very disappointed and lost a lot of faith in Gameloft. I used to love so many of their mobile games but lately it just seems like they‚Äôre trying to rush out spotty updates to keep players on their toes and hopefully, to the developers, digging in their wallets. Normally I would rate this 4/5 stars, solely knocking one because of the p2w factor. However, with Gameloft seeming to CARE less about CUSTOMER CARE, I stand by my rating of 2/5 and would not recommend this, and many other of their games to anybody. A quick side note: I have read of many instances in online forums of this same issue happening multiple times through the past. You would think they could have sorted it out much more easily. There will never be a dungeon hunter game as good as the first 2 games, and they have been LONG gone and trapped in the past due to neglect. They were beautiful single player story driven games. I can‚Äôt even tell you the countless hours I‚Äôve spent in dungeon hunter 1, 2, and dungeon hunter alliance for the ps3 and psvita. Dungeon hunter 3 was okayyyyy but definitely a downgrade, then dungeon hunter 4 released. It was a combination of a good story driven single player experience with a multiplayer OPTION. And now you‚Äôve gone full circle with your latest releases. There are countless paywalls in the new games. I miss being able to just play a game. I can‚Äôt do that anymore. I have to PAY a game now. Hopefully you come to your senses and release a real game, but like most game companies/publishers nowadays, you probably never will. Its a shame, really. Dungeon hunter 2 is my favorite mobile game of all time. I played that game so much to the point where I memorized every single aspect of the game. (Glitches, chest locations, ways to do things more quickly and efficiently, farming locations) and there‚Äôs nothing fun about the new games anymore because none of those unique experiences are possible anymore.

Some of Vector-Z's aliens have shields you have to time your shots to break through.

There is also a brief reload time. ‚Ä¢ Aliens are worth more points when they are attacking you.

I prefer using the ""glide and tap"" option but it's imprecise, lags terribly and feels floaty. The other control option uses arcade buttons and is nicely done.

PLEASE CHANGE THE YOU FAILED COMMENT. If that doesn‚Äôt change soon I will delete the appOkay I loved the app but I deleted it because there‚Äôs an app about every 15-20 seconds and every time you messed up, it would say in big capital letters YOU FAILED! Which is a very sad attempt to get people to play more. It‚Äôs really awful and I‚Äôm bringing it up to everyone who has the app. Also I think it gave my phone a ton of viruses because that she weren‚Äôt there before the app and randomly when you hit one of the red walls it might take an extra cube for no reason. ALSO DON‚ÄôT DO ANY OF THE UPDATES IF YOU HAVE THE APP. They only make it even worse. And just when you think you have a lot of cubes and it was a good round, there‚Äôs a huge pit or a bunch of barricades right at the very end that takes most of them away. I don‚Äôt want anyone to have to deal with all this ridiculousness so PLEASE save yourself the frustration and DO NOT GET THIS APP. IT‚ÄôS REALLY AWFUL. I played the game until level 20, just to make sure I was letting all the features and shops open. This is definitely a fun, relaxing, and simple game that you can easily waste a lot of time on. However, with simplicity there should be some things to spice it up. Temple Run was simple, but had upgrades. This game does offer you to change your cubes and characters, but it stays mysterious until you make the purchase with the in-game currency of diamonds. I would love to see options to upgrade the length the magnet stays on, or going quicker when hitting those little green things. With that said, the ‚Äúquick‚Äù green things don‚Äôt really make you move faster. It just adds lines to the screen to make it feel like it. I do like the fact that they give the option to buy out of ads for 2.99 as a lot of other games make weekly subscriptions or don‚Äôt offer it at all. All in all, I think it‚Äôs a cute little game and it will stay on my phone which is unusual for me! I just got the game like an hour ago. You can‚Äôt play level four!!!!!! I tried restarting my phone, restarting the game, skipping the level, even deleting the game and getting it again- it doesn‚Äôt work! The reason you can‚Äôt play the level is because the guy (also why can‚Äôt you change characters?!) and the blocks were all in visible. It said I died 2 seconds in to each game. I had to delete again. I tried again but it still wouldn‚Äôt work! I‚Äôve seen other reviews saying the exact same thing from months ago and it still hasn‚Äôt improved? That just shows that no one at the company cares. I‚Äôm really annoyed! Also, even though you can still play the levels, the other levels so far have also been glitchy! The skip level button doesn‚Äôt even work. There are ads every level and they are all 30 or 45 seconds long. I had to turn off my WiFi the ads got so bad! What really is annoying is usually I am pretty flexible with glitches. But when it gets so bad that you can‚Äôt play the game? I can‚Äôt just ignore that! Also, your ad shows that the game is not glitchy at all but seriously? If you‚Äôre not gonna fix the game then make the ads match the game! Augh!

I‚Äôve never had a game crash on me this often. Often it‚Äôll crash after playing an ad. It crashed on me just now mid-level, and this is after the game crashed so badly that I had to reinstall it and lose all my progress just to get it to work again. It‚Äôs a testament to how good the game is that I did reinstall it. It‚Äôs challenging, fun and aesthetically pleasing. You can earn many cosmetic bonuses just through gameplay and by patiently watching advertisements. You needn‚Äôt support the game financially unless you really want to, and that‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs got a great sense of whimsy to it, and I‚Äôm very fond of the little avatar I‚Äôve selected. I‚Äôm really enjoying it.If they can just patch out that horrible crash bug, they‚Äôd earn that fifth star from me. Sure, I have an iPhone 7, which probably does affect how the game runs, but a good game should run smoothly on all compatible devices, not just newer ones. Please, Lucky Kat, fix this issue! This game‚Äôs too good to have a fatal error like this! This game has a lot of charm. I love the collection aspect of the game and how you can easily get new upgrades throughout the game just by passing through levels discounting the ones which cost coins. Some suggestions I have for the game is to add way more plants to the game. I find them far more appealing than the pots but there are so few. The gameplay could also be enhanced with projectiles which destroy your vine, trampolines, or spike traps, as well as other power ups and a time limit for each level which ticks down (earning more coins for completing a level fast enough). Anything to make the game more risky. It would also be nice if you get a coin reward for how long your vine is. Lastly there should be a endless mode to achieve highs scores which includes far more enemies and dangers. The game as it is is not too challenging to progress unless your trying to collect every piece of food or destroy every enemy. All in all it‚Äôs a beautiful game that I highly recommend to anyone. Look, I absolutely adore this game. It has it all, the cute graphics, the great game physics, the mechanics, everything about it is great except the ads. I understand that as the developers, you have to make money. But, it becomes extreme when in order to plant your seeds to collect more plants in the game you have to watch an ad. EVERY TIME. Some people can not afford to watch that many ads because they do not have unlimited or any phone data nor do they have access to the internet. I just wanted to let you know that making someone watch an ad EVERY TIME YOU GET A SEED FOR A PLANT is not the best way to go for getting people to watch them.

You can get coins and gems easily and the add level is chill. I recommend if you like battle royals but your no good at them or want a royal pixielized. One complaint though is that the crates are not as fair as they should be. I realize the reason they did this is because it‚Äôs so easy to get the coins to buy them but still, they should be easier to get entire items instead of just 1 part. Or make the amount of parts you get more. Overall I rate this four stars just because of the crates thing plus I don‚Äôt like the skins that much and there‚Äôs only one map. I recommend. Thanks! Before the update, the game wasn‚Äôt fun, there was no auto attack, so now there is, and it‚Äôs so much fun, the chat is very peaceful, and you don‚Äôt have to bother about people cussing and stuff. One thing I would change is the way we get our skins, and we should team up with more people. But other than that, the game is pretty good.

I see my review from wayyy back is still on the poster for this game to sucker in players. While in some ways this is still one of the closest to the original 8 pages game, in terms of graphics and such, the game desperately needs to return to its roots with earlier versions. The sheer number of ads that bombard the player takes away from the excitement, and its annoying how often they pop up on both the menu and everytime the player dies it asks if youd like to see an ad to continue. The life bar at the top is another thing that needs to go. Part of the fear factor in playing this is in not knowing when or if slenderman would get you. The depletion of the bar is a giveaway that your about to die and coupled with the fact that slenderman makes you look at him, its also cheap. Keep the face cam and everyplay record and share features however. Its cool to be able to let others see your replays. The new levels are good add ons as well. While i can take or leave the slender coin feature, some of the features you can get with them (night vision additional levels and a page finder) are cool. Keep these but do away with continues. In short, Return this game to being more like past versions from 4 or so years ago and perhaps keep the share features. Its annoying as hell to play as is. So... what makes good horror games? The answer is kind of complicated, and since this is really a simple game I will shorten the list. First off: atmosphere! The dark forest and sounds really set off a good place to die. Humans are social beings, and being alone is one of our major weaknesses, and Slender takes advantage of that. While this game is really difficult it is possible. The more pages you collect, the more aggresive Slender gets, following right behind your every step. Tension is also a big factor: you see the page, and get a rush of elation. But you see a gaunt face peeking out of the trees. Just the fact that you have to get the pages, but Slender might already be their makes it kinda creepy.While the game to play is not very scary (the enclosed ones like warehouse are creepier because sometimes you have to turn around and Slender might be there) sometimes it really gets your heart pounding. For me, the scariest part is whenever you are home in the dark, you remember this game, and don't want to move. However, it is much like Slender on the PC. The controls can be a little iffy at times, but it adds to the 'oh god' element of horror.ENJOY!

Plus there is a level that you can make of your own and share it with your friends see if they can pass the level. You also don‚Äôt have to do the level one you can skip a level and do the easy and fun action in it. What is also good about this game is that you can probably download on other devices or consoles and don‚Äôt have to upgrade or update the game so you can save your data on the console or device. You don‚Äôt have to keep raging just because there is no internet Happy Wheels doesn‚Äôt need internet so you can play offline anytime anywhere. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about happy wheels is that there are only a couple of characters and can‚Äôt play ‚ÄúCOMING SOON‚Äù characters so it does need some updates also you can only play ‚ÄúCOMING SOON‚Äù characters whenever are making your own level to share with your friends. So whoever made this game please add more characters and let us play ‚ÄúCOMING SOON‚Äù characters in original levels...thank youüëå I personally find this game great, and it‚Äôs really fun. I‚Äôd be on my phone 24/7 playing this game if it wasn‚Äôt for the ads. Every 6 tries or so, you get an ad, which you can skip 5 seconds in, only to wait another 12 seconds while they show it to you as a preview from the App Store. And if you don‚Äôt have Internet, they still make you wait 10 seconds while they show you a blue screen showing the timer. But in that case, you get an ad every time you go to another level, and that is simply too much.Another really bad thing about this game is the frequency of updates and new added levels. It‚Äôs been forever since I‚Äôve been waiting for the levels for pogo stick guy and the couple, but I think the developers forgot about that completely and that‚Äôs honestly a bummer. They could‚Äôve nominated levels created by other people as the levels made for those two characters, all while adding more building features for fan-made levels.The final thing that made me change my 5-star rating down to 2 is the inability to play/explore other people‚Äôs levels. This feature would‚Äôve kept me on this game nonstop, just exploring other people‚Äôs creations and messing around with them. I love this game, and I also can play this on my computer, but it‚Äôs easier on my iPad, and my computer can‚Äôt handle playing happy wheels, it‚Äôs usually laggy. But mobile doesn‚Äôt have any updates, new characters, or the search tab for levels. I‚Äôm giving this game a 4 star review, because it‚Äôs not completed, and I don‚Äôt think it ever will be. This game hasn‚Äôt been updated for 2 or more years. I‚Äôm also really confused, because in the level creator, we don‚Äôt have half of the other items that people on computers have. And we can‚Äôt do any levels on other characters because it says ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù even though they‚Äôve never come yet. But in the level creator, we can play with the characters that are ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù in the level list. I really think this game needs some updates. Other than that, it‚Äôs a good game, and if anyone wants to get happy wheels because they can‚Äôt play on a computer, then you can get this game. It‚Äôs still fun either way.

A lot of people are saying this is a ripoff of Buddy but based off what I‚Äôve seen with the chained doll and the weapons, it seems more like a Smash Dude rip-off, but with less flavor and overall just more bland and boring. Overall decent game but if your looking for something similar with a larger inventory and just more more in general, I suggest Smash Dude. But overall decent game, if there was a larger inventory and just overall a bit more (facial features and more movement for example), then this would definitely be a better game.

‚ÄéJet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum,"NEWS FLASH! - the Manic Miner¬Æ app - a perfectly formed replica of the much-loved home computer game, with 3D voxel-style graphics - AVAILABLE NOW Search the App Store for ‚Äúthe Manic Miner¬Æ app‚Äù. IMPORTANT: To 'Save' the game go 'Back' to the Main Menu before quitting the App. Jet Set Willy for the ZX Spectrum (an 8-bit personal home computer released in the UK in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd, which sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide) is one of THE defining games of the 1980s. Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is offered as an in-app purchase from within the Recreated ZX Spectrum app. The Recreated ZX Spectrum app includes more ZX Spectrum games plus Sinclair BASIC. Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other ZX Spectrum games but it does include an infinite-lives version. Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is the 100% original ZX Spectrum game, written in 1984 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our ZX Spectrum: Elite Collection technology. Featuring: - portrait and landscape play / display modes - iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad & canvas) Controls - ‚Äòauto save‚Äô, on exiting the game - authentic 'Spectrum' sound Jet Set Willy was published in 1984 by Software Projects. The game is a sequel to Manic Miner (1983), and is the second game in the immensely popular Miner Willy Series. The Plot: A tired Miner Willy  has to tidy up all the items left around his house after a huge party. With this done his housekeeper Maria will allow him access to his bedroom. Willy's mansion was bought with the wealth obtained from his adventures in Manic Miner  but much of it remains unexplored and it appears to be full of strange creatures, possibly a result of the previous (missing) owner's experiments. Willy must explore the enormous mansion and its grounds (including a beach and a yacht) to fully tidy up the house so he can get some much-needed sleep. Game-play: Willy moves from room to room in his mansion collecting objects. Unlike the screen-by-screen style of its prequel, the player can explore the mansion at will and tackle the screens in the order of their choosing. Willy is controlled using only left, right and jump. He can climb stairs by walking into them (jumping through them to avoid them) and climb swinging ropes by pushing left or right depending on what direction the rope is swinging in. The play area itself consists of 60 flick-screen  making-up the mansion and its grounds and containing hazards (static killer objects), patrolling monsters (killer guardians which move along predetermined paths), various platforms and collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other items in the room. Willy loses a life if he touches an enemy or falls too far, and he is returned to the point at which he entered the room. This may lead to a game-ending situation in which Willy repeatedly falls from a height, losing all lives in succession. Bugs: As originally released, the game could not be completed due to several bugs. Although actually four completely unrelated issues, they became known collectively as ""The Attic Bug"". After the player entered the room The Attic, various rooms would undergo corruption on all subsequent game plays, including all monsters disappearing from The Chapel, and other screens triggering instant death. Initially Software Projects attempted to pass off this bug off as an intentional feature to make the game more difficult, claiming that the rooms in question were filled with poison gas. However, they later rescinded this claim and issued a set of POKEs to correct the flaws.

Build a dungeon full of lethal traps and priceless gems, then raid other players‚Äô lairs and amass a fortune. Cuddly characters and a playful atmosphere provide the perfect counterpoint for tricky scenarios requiring skill, strategy, and cunning. This is a great game, but like I said in the title, there are a few things that I don‚Äôt like. Four things. One, I don‚Äôt like it that you have to complete your dungeon two times in a row to save. I understand that you made that concept to prevent players from making impossible stages, but I feel like you don‚Äôt need to complete it two times in a row to show that it‚Äôs not impossible.Two, I really don‚Äôt like how sometimes when someone steals your gem, you can‚Äôt get revenge if they are online. Yesterday I got my most valuable gem stolen and I had to wait for today to try to get it back JUST BECAUSE HE WAS ONLINE. That brings me to my third thing. I find it really annoying that if your gemstone isn‚Äôt on the totem of the person who stole from you, you can‚Äôt get it even when you complete their dungeon. It‚Äôs really annoying and since you can‚Äôt get two revenges, you have to really on your clan mates, or hope that you just happen to find that exact person‚Äôs dungeon and that he has your gemstone on his totem. Since my most valuable gem was stolen, I completed his dungeon, but since my gemstone wasn‚Äôt on there, I couldn‚Äôt get. Fourth, could you remove the aspect that once you die a lot of times it automatically disables one of the traps. It‚Äôs really annoying that you can get your gem stolen just because of that aspect. I think that is they want to disable a trap, it has to come from their own storage. I HATE the Christmas update. It was good before. Please tell me it‚Äôll go back to normal soon! I didn‚Äôt even wanna update, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me play until I did, and it wouldn‚Äôt even let me update for a few days, so I wasn‚Äôt able to play and a bunch of my gold and one of my gems got stolen and I couldn‚Äôt do anything and the stupid raiding houses through chimneys got me to blow all my orbs avoiding the red guards and I ran out I didn‚Äôt get any treasure how could anyone get through all 25 houses anyway? And they shuffle the presents and I thought that it was like following the cups with your eyes and choosing which one had the ball but no it was just random and also a while back you got rid of the option to report some dungeons as impossible because there are some seriously sketchy ones and I am NOT just saying that out of spite I would try to check the dungeon solution for those when I gave up and the game would disconnect that also happens a lot when I‚Äôm trying to retrieve guild members gems I would be on, like, my 20th try and just when I‚Äôm about to get close the frickin‚Äô thing disconnects and it counts it as a failure Also traps for new dungeons and upgrading traps is way too expensive and they‚Äôre not even that good AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH.              okay, I‚Äôm calm now. Just fix this stuff. PLEASE.

It can get laggy at times, but I love it! I highly do recommend it! Every single thing is Child-Friendly! You can‚Äôt do alot, but it‚Äôs REALLY addictive üòÅ. I spend about 5 hours a day playing this game. Its very addictive, my big and lil brother play it to. I really enjoy the game and hope everyone else rates 5 stars! And no, I want NOTHING to change :). And if you suggest something, it‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt really like the game. Please don‚Äôt change the game. I extremely enjoy it and I hope you all do to! This is a very very addictive game with a short review. I just hope it stays the same forever. If it‚Äôs banned, I‚Äôll be devastated. Tysm for reading this! :) I think, I KNOW this game is 5 stars, but there is one small problem that if fixed, wouldn‚Äôt make me think twice about rating 5 stars. Sometimes when I‚Äôm in the leaderboard like 1st or 2nd place and I‚Äôm not dying to other snakes, the game just glitches me out and kills me FOR NO REASON. I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch or a really small snake spawning in front of me, but either way find a way to fix it. Now I‚Äôm not saying this happens to often, but I‚Äôm saying it happens when your really big and when you‚Äôve been playing for a while in the top of the leaderboard. Other than that great game! Does anyone know what the GREEN CIRCLE potion is for????I've been glued to the game the second i DL it, and even gotten friends and family stuck on it! There is a couple annoying things though. Like it doesn't matter how high your score is, the points to level up don't roll over so you have to keep killing yourself for the points to count üò£. I can live with that but what really makes me crazy is YOU GUYS NEED TO PUT IN A PAUSE BUTTON!! I played for 5 1/2 hours once and had to keep asking for help playing if I needed to get up to do something! Fix those things and I'll give it 5 stars!! Some extra faces, skins and ability to customize the special skins would be awesome too!! Hi there! Wow that is so impressive! I guess it's been a while and we've had many upgrades since then - you should check it out. However, the pause button hasn't been released yet. We will definitely take it into consideration.

We found ourselves gawking at reflections, lens flare, and scenery as we motored through hairpin turns at breakneck speeds. The improvements aren't just cosmetic, though‚Äîyou'll find yourself stunned by the believable roars of engines and the huge variety of true-to-life cars and courses. RR3 also packs great new gameplay features like Time Shifted Multiplayer, which allows us to race asynchronously against friends in fierce tests of driving prowess. If been playing this game for a while, and I‚Äôve got to level 66! I‚Äôve never gone this far in my first try at the game. The game still has awesome graphics, and there are less lags now. Still, the game is a pay-to-win thing if you want to earn or buy a car right there and then. I‚Äôve just started to become interested in F1, and the 2020 season has just started, which is cool so far. The only thing that bothers me is that I have never been able to earn a car through any special event, not just F1. The only time I did that was the 2019 season of F1. Although the game is challenging and fun, it might be too challenging for people who don‚Äôt have a lot of in-game money. Here is a suggestion, maybe you could lower the cost of any special event for people level 100>/ people with less than 1,500,000 in-game money (M$/R$). I hope you make this masterpiece better and easier for players. Edit: Whew, I just finished four stages of Monaco with the update. I just saved up for a million days of earning m dollars to do this, and I still don‚Äôt have enough money to make it to stage five. Please, make the costs of tuning/upgrades cheaper! It‚Äôs really tiring when you have to plan on how to earn money and everything when school‚Äôs started for me. And take the do not ‚Äúdamage your car‚Äù out of the goals in special events because it is just almost impossible for me to not to damage my car without not getting to a certain place like p3 or something like that. I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and a half now. I was playing consistently for the first 6 months without ever having to spend real money. Then once I got to ‚ÄúDriver Level‚Äù 170, I slowed down on my playing as I wasn‚Äôt able to progress at a fast rate without having to spend real money. I would play only the daily bonus then go play another racing app. I started racing more consistently when RR3 finally added the first 2 Honda‚Äôs on an update, as I‚Äôm a Honda fan. So ever since then I‚Äôm now a ‚ÄúDriver Level‚Äù 265 with 226 cars in my garage. And I‚Äôve been spending real money in order to progress and collect more cars to my collection. I only spend real money on sales and discounts. I keep my R$, M$ and GC in top amounts so I can continue to progress. So many complaints about RR3 having to spend real money in order to progress, kinda true but only if you want to progress in a faster rate. You can progress without spending real money, but just at a slower rate and people don‚Äôt get that. At the time I slowed down playing RR3 because I didn‚Äôt want to spend real money, I tried out other racing apps and nothing compares to RR3! RR3 has the most cars ever in an app game. So I don‚Äôt mind spending real money in order to progress at a faster rate, plus my goal now is to collect every car available. Thanks RR3 for an amazing app game, but please try to add my own car ‚Äú2012 Honda Civic SI‚Äù and a current ‚ÄúHonda Civic SI‚Äù. I‚Äôd love to drive my car on here!

We can‚Äôt stop laughing and enjoying our time together. You move the arm whichever way you want and move both legs which way you want and it gets locked in. When the match starts, it‚Äôs sit back and watch your robot go at it! üòÇüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüëçüèΩ Highly recommend! Warning: No one will sleep after downloading this üòÇüëå‚ù§Ô∏èü§™ü§™ü§© The game‚Äôs concept is fine, and the simple design is quite different from other robotic based games out there, but some things DO need some work. For example, I think the concept of teaching your robot on the design screen is nice, but I think it is a little too much when actually using it in-game. Because if your just messing around with the robot, it actually creates a sort of back up that it uses if you do not input a movement to the robot, while I like how the game gives you the choice of making a backup, I think they should have made it a a bit more specific.I think they *may* have added a *bit* too many ads in between games, but that‚Äôs just my opinion, because if your the type of person who likes to watch ads, that‚Äôs totally fine. But now to the actual gameplay, I feel that it could be a little more                 ‚Äúless random‚Äù. What I mean is that whenever you input a movement, the robot just kind of do us it‚Äôs own thing, so the movement could be a bit more calculated.But in the end, despite having some flaws left and right. It‚Äôs a fun game about robots and destruction. Maybe it‚Äôs meant to be random so it‚Äôs kinda frustrating. But what do I know? I‚Äôm not a game designer. Game starts outs great. Love the concept. Somehow was 1st place for the contests. So I made another account on my other phone... didn‚Äôt see my main account at the number 1 spot. Whatever. Now, it seems like I‚Äôm facing a lot of the same players. No matter what type of match I play. High and low costing games. There‚Äôs one in particular that‚Äôs a robot w/ nothing but the stinger that barley moves so that you just lose. Literally takes no effort. A lot of those and other similar robots that I can‚Äôt get around. It‚Äôs like the 3 same presets for different scenarios. I have to get lucky and switch presets last second to hopefully screw them over. But even then... they still just seem unfair and a little too fortunate at times.It‚Äôs still pretty fun. But as I progress and get less parts I actually find useful or beneficial; the more I face these same exact presets. Like literally somehow the same movements as if these aren‚Äôt real players.

There‚Äôs always something new, and literal years of gameplay for the casual player. There‚Äôs nothing pay to win about this game, and the option to pay is (in my opinion) worth it. I have unlocked all of the characters (about $10 for all of them) and am happy with my decision. This game is better then some games for consoles I‚Äôve played, and even without paying its one of the best. Those ten dollars is like buying a console or pc tier game for much cheaper then a pc game that‚Äôs as good. There‚Äôs limitless possibilities and limitless playtime, regardless if you have cash to burn or not. It‚Äôs a simple and fun experience playing the game. It starts out extremely hard, but as you play more, you soon win easily. The hundreds of weapons keep the game interesting every time you play, and can make awesome combos. This game is 100% worth downloading and I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone. Much love to the devs and thank you for what‚Äôs possibly the greatest mobile game I‚Äôll ever have the experience of playing.The one thing I do want is better iOS support and better cloud saves, but other then that, this is an amazing game, and the saves don‚Äôt tarnish it at all. I have been playing this game for a quite a while now, and the only criticism that comes to mind is that the game has quite a few P2W in app purchases. Granted Chillyroom needs this money to stay afloat and you can get by without spending any money, but it‚Äôs just kind of insane how many there are. But other than that and the undeniable fact that this game can prove to be a bit tricky to casual players, this is a 10/10 star game in my mind with. Now onto positives: I really like it‚Äôs difficulty curves, they allow to get a hang of the new biome‚Äôs enemies and hazards before expanding and throwing more of said enemies and hazards at you. The boss themes are very energetic and hype you up for the following fight, even though this can not be said for the final boss theme it being more grand and whatnot. I also find it‚Äôs progression to be pretty neat as well, both learning how to beat monsters with ease and flat out power increases coincide to make you feel like an unstoppable force (that is if you‚Äôre not too cocky and play your cards right). Okay, I‚Äôm getting tired of writing but if you are still reading this review and haven‚Äôt played Soul Knight before you should, it‚Äôs a great game. This is an absolute blast. When you first start the game it will seem rather difficult and frustrating but once you beat your first run it‚Äôs all up hill from there. This isn‚Äôt a pay-to-play kind of game. There are certain characters and things in the game to enhance your gameplay which you do have to pay for but it‚Äôs not necessary to enjoy the game. Now the reason I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 is the cloud save. Three times now I have lost my data. As soon as your done playing for the day make sure you cloud save. The first two times it was when the game first came out and it would bug out so my data would wipe. The recent time I have lost my data though I had over 100 hours into the game; almost 2 years of gameplay gone. I had all the free characters unlocked, fully upgraded, and a ton of resources. I went to open up the app and it would crash as soon as I did. A week later they updated the game and all my data was wiped. I went to the cloud save to get my data back and all that was there was data I had in the first few months of me playing. I love this game but after working so hard to get to where I was and losing it all it‚Äôs bittersweet to get back into the grind of the game to get to back to where I was.

I think the developers had as much fun coming up with all the cat puns as they did the exciting and engaging story. The side quests were all spunky and enjoyable, the world was very well laid out with increasing difficulty as you headed north, causing you to pause and enjoy getting stronger in each location before rushing headlong into the next area. I loved the diversity of equipment and powers and really found a simple pleasure in the attack/retreat pattern of fighting enemies. I loved all the secrets and mysteries hidden throughout the land and once (no spoilers here) a certain ability was unlocked, I couldn‚Äôt wait to search the whole world to its fullest. Great job guys, I enjoyed the game very much!P.S. I‚Äôm so sad to see you added Cat Quest 2 to the Apple Arcade roster which means I will never get to enjoy it due to my refusal to sign up for a membership to play games occasionally on my phone. I don‚Äôt believe in subscriptions and I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea. I would love to pay a flat price and enjoy your sequel, but as it stands I guess number one will have to live forever in my memory as the pleasant and only Cat Quest to me. Cat Quest is very fun and addicting - just a couple changes I would like.When you go into the area to see your weapons, armor and spells you tap on the icon in the bottom left. Then to exit you click on an icon in the upper left. I would love for the exit icon to ‚Äîalways‚Äî be in the same place as the icon to get into anything.I would like more control of how far I zoom out. And I would like to be able to tap somewhere and have kitty cat start walking to that place with the zoom zooming back in on where the cat is. Also on zooming. I would love to be able to tap with two fingers anytime I‚Äôm zoomed out and have it zoom back in for me instead of tapping on an icon. You can add it as part of the training at one of the monuments. Either tap on the icon or double-tab anywhere to unzoom. Or even double-tap to zoom out and then double-tap to zoom back in.Oh, and I would love to be able to put my own X somewhere. I could then tap on that X later with a note about that place. Like that place where you walk through the water to the chest that is off screen? Not everyone will remember where that is after you finally find the key. I‚Äôve spent a few hours playing the game and been all over and haven‚Äôt found the key yet.I would also like to be able tap on the stats for each item so that it can tell me exactly what it refers to. Like 6/6 = six of what and six of what? The game cant really stand on its own ... its not engaging enough to hold your full attention - its more of a mindless game you would play while watching a movie or on a long car ride. Customization is key for a good RPG game and this game offers very little. You get stronger gear from chests & quests, basically you'll get 3 sets - tank, mage or DPS. There is no kind of enhancement or crafting system. Skills are boring too - you pay gold to increase their damage aaaand that's it. I'd say this game would be good for ages 13 and under ... older and you probably wont be too impressed. Due to its simplicity, i believe a 5 year old could easily beat this game. I would say i got my 5 bucks worth as far as the amount of time ive sunk into the game. The 3-star rating is because it's not a great match for me personally, but I would recommend it for casual players and a younger audience. It is a well polished game, my experience has been bug-free and never had even a single crash. There is a foundation here for a 5-star game - as it is, it is generic, lacking in features and any kind of originality to make it a memorable experience. Hoping the developers will give this game a bit more love.

Please fix this I love playing this game with my best friend but when I getting ripped up by people that aren‚Äôt actually skilled and they pay to win I get so angry because you can‚Äôt do anything about it. Thank you for your kind words and critics as well. We will improve our matchmaking so that not paying users don't feel that bad about the game. If you have screenshots of unbalanced match and rating, win rate % information, please let us know, this will help improving. support@panzerdog.com I urge devs to read this because I‚Äôll be including ideas for next update. I really enjoy this game and play with my brother every so often. I do have problems with it such as the unbalanced part when playing with guys who spent money on the game but I understand it‚Äôs pay to win. I would like to see some new maps such as the ‚ÄúDo not‚Äù map seen in images and the one with the choppers. New vehicles such as choppers added to much larger maps if the game could run it would be great. Attachments and different time set maps would be cool such as  night maps where flashlights are good. Seeing a PvE mode like zombies or even a coop story mode would be interesting. (I want to point out I don‚Äôt expect any of these to come out soon or ever but would throughly enjoy them in the future). I enjoy the new game mode you added but I barely get that one chosen. Maybe adding a select game mode option would be nice after more are implemented. Add a repair tool or wrench to fix destroyed cars. I noticed that when someone leaves the game, an A.I. Continues to play for you or the other person which allows for unbalanced matches which is bad. Either remove the person entirely or don‚Äôt allow leaving. Allow vehicles to survive longer but make the occupants weaker while in said vehicle. But most importantly, keep doing what you guys are doing because you have created a really good game that is so addicting that even when you lose you want to play again just to feel better. Ill start off by saying that I love this game. It‚Äôs action packed and has some interesting mechanics. My only complaint is being able to acquire coins in a decent amount of time is near impossible without spending hours playing daily or just spending real money. Some weapons you can earn coins per kill but I think that should be a feature with every gun, just more coins per kill for the more premium and higher tier weapons. We should at least get coins for winning instead of hoping for the random bonus spin which gives you a negligible amount of coins and none of the gold coins or doing ‚Äúgoals‚Äù that pay 30 coins. There should be a base bonus for winning in each rank. Realistically I can only spend my coins upgrading one weapon to even compete at my rank. Or I have to purposely lose A LOT of matches to get people of similar skill and weapon tier. That also makes some of the missions insanely hard to complete. Even if its just 100 coins per win and 5-20 coins per kill depending on weapon MK lvl I‚Äôd play more than once a week. Again great game, its just hard to stay interested when it‚Äôs so time consuming to save up for just one weapon upgrade that gives mild improvements for us broke people not willing to pay to win.

So far lots of fun and actually has somewhat of a choice system in which you decide how the future will be. However there are a few issues I do have. One is the glitch where if you dash at a wall sometimes you will get stuck and the enemies will absolutely obliterate you if you don‚Äôt know the exact why to get out. Another is the weapon balancing, now I understand that the weapons are preference and get stronger over time however the cultless sword is the best starting sword to have as the added range beats any other light weapon in the game, the double edge is pretty good too. But the mace is really bad and needs a buff. I would also love to see like frequent updates so we can grow this world! Great job so far. What I love about this game is it doesn‚Äôt punish you for getting killed, you actually get some buffs and perks. With this said you will most likely die a lot if your not that good at fast mostly up close games like I. It took me like 5 tries to kill Dracula‚Äôs hound, and after killing him the levels only get harder it seems if you get hit once your dead. When I finally got to the Dracula level I didn‚Äôt even make it to him before I died. At that point i was a little annoyed going through the seemingly same decisions and levels all just to die and do it again, a real ground hog day feel. But if you have the time or are bored and just want to mess some enemies up as a vampire go for it. One thing I would like is a OST, I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for it, specially the final Dracula stage music which sounds sick. In a crowded mobile space, Immortal Rogue really stands out. Rather than just surface-level, mindless clicking, it brings impressive polish, unique mechanics, interesting premise, and a fun, replay-worthy formula to the table. The combat is fun and easy to learn, and the game offers a progressive challenge for those who are up to it. What‚Äôs really nice about Immortal Rogue is that you can pick it up and play for a couple minutes, or stick to it for a few hours. Either way, you‚Äôre getting a satisfying, rewarding experience. The added layers of the time-traveling story, upgradable abilities and weapons, and changing environments really gives it a fresh, addictive quality every time you jump back in. This one‚Äôs a winner and should be played by anyone who loves an original, well-made game‚Äîlooking forward to how many years I can make it on my next run through time.

Also if you collect everything and you are dying you can simply use the carrots and start exactly where you just made a mistake, I‚Äôve never been placed in a look of me ‚Äúdying‚Äù also they have a place where you just watch ads and it keeps re spawning you where you left off Incase you don‚Äôt have carrots it has also never crashed for me 10/10 This is the first time that I‚Äôve rated something, and yet I have a lot to say. The sprite work is phenomenal and the game doesn‚Äôt lag, which is nice. The levels are well made, but sometimes I go one way, thinking that it‚Äôs a bonus area, but then I see the end, and I can‚Äôt bump into a wall to turn around. Maybe put a small telltale sign that casual players won‚Äôt notice? Anyways, that isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but there are a few that I need to address. First off, ads. The ads are constant, and they happen after every death, restart, and level select. It‚Äôs nice that the devs added a ‚ÄòNo Ads‚Äô purchase, but I‚Äôm not paying three dollars for it. Maybe .99? I don‚Äôt know. Second, the controls. The one-hand gameplay style is convenient, but the fact that you have to bump into a wall to turn around is annoying. I think it would be better to swipe one way or another to turn. I know that‚Äôs a pretty big gameplay change, but I certainly think it would improve the game. And lastly, the death mechanism. It‚Äôs annoying to almost finish a stage, but then mistime a jump and fall into the water. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Mario games, so maybe add a power-up mushroom, or an Extra Life token as a bonus. So all in all, it‚Äôs a good game. Is it my favorite? No. Is it my least favorite? No. If you like short platforming adventures, download it. But just don‚Äôt get to happy, because there are some downsides. That‚Äôs really it. The game starts out really fun and it‚Äôs easy to collect items. It‚Äôs especially interesting to explore all the different paths in the levels. The speed is quite jarring, and it isn‚Äôt something I got used to, especially when this + the point of view makes you run into enemies you don‚Äôt see coming half the time. But the mechanic of not being able to change direction until you hit a wall gets very annoying VERY fast. The levels also become crazy hard way too soon and depending on where and when you spawn, you may get stuck in a loop of dying over and over because there isn‚Äôt anything you can do to avoid it. The game also tends to crash in the middle of levels (without saving your progress, of course), so there‚Äôs that. All these things added up very quickly and made this cute game unenjoyable for me, and I ended up just deleting the app in the middle level 12. Why would I spend my time on something that‚Äôs just going to raise my blood pressure because of things I can‚Äôt control?

Slow Katz: you just talk to captain kallio skipping everything as fast as you could and just go out and see the snowstorm and somehow  just randomly the game just gets slow right after something fast.  2.floating Katz: I have no idea about how this glitch happened but somehow in return to the swamp, the cat just sinks into the ground when on the ground but when you press left or right fast enough, the cat just floats. Even if you change the cat you still float. 3. Freezing Katz: just so you know, the ‚Äò‚Äôfreezing‚Äô‚Äô meant like the game soft locked. I know how to do this glitch!!! In Kaze towers, when you go to the door that leads to the place where there is this someone who gives the key to the sky labyrinth, okay, so you just go there, look at the door, equip the balloon item, float, and when the balloon pops, hold left until you land and the game. just. soft locks. I downloaded the game on the AppStore and to undo the glitches, just restart the app (don‚Äôt delete it)!Fun fact:Did you know that in the super cat tales timeline, Super cat tales 2 is actually before the first? Watch the video ‚Äúsuper cat tales timeline‚Äù for more info. Please just go with Shriyans instead of Shriyansp8. A lot of love went into this game and you can tell. The story actually has some dept for a side scrolling mobile game. Though this game does have some caveats for any non gamers looking for a game similar to Mario or Kirby. 1. Coin grinding. Unless you're willing to spend $10, collecting the right amount of coins is going to feel like a chore. You‚Äôd have to repeatedly replay a specific level more than 50 times to grind for coins to proceed in the game. Personally I think this creator is worth the $10 but if you can‚Äôt pay then prepare for repeating 2-4.2. YOU ARE GOING DIE over and over and over again. Not going to lie, this game is going to be frustrating because sheer amount of death you‚Äôll experience. Some deaths are permanent, some are due to monkeys, and some are due to impatience. You‚Äôd either have to be patient or play better, you‚Äôre stilling going to die a bunch though.3. Platforming in the later stages becomes unnecessarily difficult. If you want to beat the game, you gotta work on your platforming during this game. You don‚Äôt get punished in early stages but once you get to world 7.. oof TLDR: It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows in this cute kitty cat game. Be prepared for fun, rage, tears, and lots of death. Seriously.. you‚Äôll die.. a lot.. I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but when I played this game, I knew I had to. I love how you can switch cats on the fly, something cat tales 1 didn‚Äôt let you do. The mechanic is so overused yet in this game it seems so original. All cats play pretty distinctly and have their own abilities. When I first picked up the game I thought it was going to be simple, joystick controls. When I loaded the first level, and saw the controls which are very hard to describe other than weird, I thought of deleting the game. But after the third level I had gotten used to it and the controls were pretty easy to understand. This is a game with unusual controls but nevertheless is easy to control. I‚Äôve seen reviews with people saying the controls are broken, to them, I say try harder.The soundtrack astonished me at first because I‚Äôve never really played a mobile game with such a good soundtrack. So play this game for yourself and enjoy everything this game has to offer.

Even though there‚Äôs not a huge variety in the cycling of the available ‚Äúcourses‚Äù it does help learn how to best play the level. If they added even 10 more courses it would give a better variety. After you‚Äôve reached about level 30 (which isn‚Äôt a terribly difficult thing to do) there‚Äôs nothing else to earn. It simply becomes leveling up. The only rewards are different style pieces. However even though you can‚Äôt earn any more rewards, when you level up it still says to ‚Äúclaim reward‚Äù and automatically changes your pieces to the last ones you earned. This then means that you either have to be constantly changing the pieces to the ones you want or you simply have to stay with what they put you on. The last thing that seems like a glitch is that you don‚Äôt always get your sized up pieces for the next round of a match. There have been times that I‚Äôve had two knights at the end of the round and either had none or only one starting off the next round. Or that I‚Äôve had a bishop at the end of the round but was only given a knight for the next round. If these couple of glitches were fixed and there was more to earn once you get further in the game this would be a fantastic game. Otherwise it‚Äôs still a pretty good game. I think it's a great concept. I love the game. There's a glitch when you get to bonus rounds though. If you get all the stars you get 350. It asks you to watch a video to double up. Every time I try to double up and watch the whole video, it will glitch out and my score will start at zero and then add up to where it basically gives me the 350 I would have gotten without watching the video. ALSO, you really need too design a way to show what each playing piece is worth at each level it is. I shouldn't have to watch at the end and write down what each one is worth. Maybe even a tree graph to show what it takes to get from a basic pawn to upgraded queen would be cool too. I still enjoy the game very much and I love the whole idea of it 4/5 from me until there's some issues fixed. Thanks y'all, keep up the good workü§üüèΩ This game glitches literally every single level. It is always one of two, technically three glitches. The first glitch is that the game momentarily freezes, briefly before crashing, wiping all progress from your current level. The other glitch is that the game zooms out so far that you cannot even see the red and blue of the pieces whatsoever. Hand in hand with the second glitch, it also zooms in all the way so that all you see is the solid color of the platform that the pieces are on, forcing you to close the game out, DUE TO THERE BEING NO HOME BUTTON!!! What kind of crap game has no repeat level or home button? Either way, you can only successfully beat a level with rewards and all only one percent of the time. It I really hope that a potential player sees this message and this saves them a great deal of frustration. Quite simply, this is straight up the worst mobile game I have ever played in my lifetime. If there was an ability to attach pictures to this, then I have the screenshots of the zoom malfunctions. Any player would be better off having never played this game, or even heard of it. Oh, and by the way, it says there are oh-so-many five-star reviews? Guess what! I scrolled down for a straight 3 minutes in the reviews and DID NOT SEE ONE FIVE STAR REVIEW!!!!

I highly recommend it, but it has its flaws once you‚Äôre about a week in. You reach a Plateau where it become hard to upgrade your characters and harder still to get better gear. My hero‚Äôs are level 28 and 29 but all the gear in the pvp shop is level 32 to 37 so I can‚Äôt buy stuff there. Same with the crates. I only get lvl 30+ from those now and on top of that I can‚Äôt complete the 3rd part of the daily missions to get the proto chests because it require 1,000 power more than any of my hero‚Äôs have. It‚Äôs give me a sense that the developers are trying to get me to spend money to upgrade, which I would totally do if it weren‚Äôt for how ludicrous the prices are for ingame purchases. The only bundle for dog tags that is half way decent costs $100! I‚Äôd spend $5 maybe $10 on dog tags, but their prices are so high that $20 is the minimum price for crystals that will buy your their lowest bundle of dog tags. The lowest bundle would not upgrade one of my characters once. This game clearly wants you to spend BIG money for no gain and that is really sad! It should be about the experience and fostering a good time not the money. But again, fun game. There are a lot of characters with different abilities, a lot of weapons with different effects and you would think a lot different strategies to play and get the W, but no. In PvP you have no control over your team, they battle in ‚Äúauto‚Äù. I think the PvP would be more entertaining and feel more rewarding if we were actually doing something besides arranging the order of which we fight. Winning is all based on ‚Äúpower‚Äù, regardless if your playing missions or in PvP which is an obvious ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù set up and there is no continuous competitive play or arcade mode which makes the game repetitive. You can only replay missions you have already beaten or replay expeditions which is only a few for a while because of the ‚Äúpower‚Äù problem mentioned before. Bottom line, if you play games for 5-15 minutes and are done and like SLOW progression, then this seems like a good fit. IF YOU ENJOY (semi)COMPETITIVE GAMEPLAY, THINK AGAINAlso there‚Äôs no social network here at all, that might make the game more interesting. Hello, thank you for your feedback. Everything that you've mentioned is in development. Unfortunately, we can't bring all at once; we're constantly adding new features.Non-auto PvP will be added when we would be able to establish more servers to support a more stable connection and fast response. It's a long-term goal, and we hope to reach it this year. Also, PvP is not about power, more about tactics, and calculating the right counter to the enemy's team. You can win against enemies a lot more powerful than you if you use the right heroes, weapons, and stones.Social features are in development and most probably will be added in the Update 1.5.Also, we hope to return competitive co-op gameplay soon, when (again) the issue with servers will be solved. Bombastic Brothers is a wonderful 2d platforming Run n‚Äô Gun with rpg elements. I even saw a few story elements to the old Contra games on Nintendo!  Always a great genre and super fun to play. I was having a fantastic time until I got to the 4th act and saw I was 4K power too short to continue further. So either need to make not such a giant gap in power to continue or create more ways to grind the dog tags and equipment you need to go further. I can‚Äôt upgrade my training room to make my heroes higher level, until I upgrade my bridge, and I am not strong enough to get more money and tags until I can. So I feel as if I‚Äôm stuck unless I spend a lot of money on just dog tags and gems. I always spend 5-10 dollars to help devs anyway, but I think I would have to spend much more to get anywhere. So great game devs, just need more ways to get what we need to keep going. The more time people are playing the game, the more likely they are to spend money! Keep up the good work!!

You can‚Äôt freely customize your character and if you lose, you lose everything you built up.It‚Äôs really unfair when you have to start all over in story mode due to something incomprehensible. To those who want to play this, you can probably beat this game in the entire day since I almost conquered the entire cities. It‚Äôs pretty hard to understand game though the graphics make it fun.

I mean, you probably think this is just another dumb, no effort put into it, car racing game. But no, this one is different. I think there was actually a LOT of effort put into the making. First off, it's not impossible to win. I hate games where it's impossible to win, I just give up. But this game, you can ACTUALLY win. It's also good for killing time. TO THE GAME-MAKERS: I think it's so clever that the car customizations are merging cars! Some games are JUST merging things, so this is like 2 games in one. And I know you get a lot of bad reviews on how many ads there are, but I honestly don't think there are that many. And there IS a variety of ads, which I love because if I keep on seeing the same ad over and over again, I just close out the app.THANKS FOR READING When I got this game I thought it was not going to be what they said it was. It turns out that this game is amazing. I have had for almost 4 months and only had a few problems. It only froze and I had to close the app and then reopen it. It makes you feel happy because you get millions of coins after each race. The cars are really cool, and you never know what the next car will be. It could be a Porsche, or it could be a Bentley. I am currently at level 25 and have 50.8 billion coins. Other than the one little problem, this game is amazing. I got this app VERY recently and I have to say it is super fun and attractive. After a little it gets sort of boring you could say. Over all it is great, but there is a bug. There are SO many adds, and I usually don‚Äôt care about adds but it is abnormal. If your a patient person get this app, if you get angry about any adds you shouldn‚Äôt get this.This is a great app and it deserves 5 stars. Thank you for taking your time to read this!!

It's all about watching and learning, and then skillfully pulling off attacks at the right moment‚Äù.  Defkalion was fishing at the quiet blue sea when he heard the voice of the Goddess Athena. ‚ÄúHurry up‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe isle of Issyos has been cursed by the Olympus!‚Äù And so, fearing for his daughter Delia, his only family left, the fisherman sails back to his home, where the adventure is about to begin. The Curse of Issyos is a retro-styled action platformer with nothing but the classics of an old 8-bit game: a good bunch of enemies and bosses, linear and open scroll levels, secrets to discover, and a background story inspired by Greek mythology. It doesn't try to mimic a retro system in particular, but it's coherent with its own limitations in the use of colors, sprites and chip sounds.

But sadly the game lacks in a lot of areas animation quality, balance, weapon variety, customization, map and game modes.Although graphics are surprisingly attractive the stiff and up smooth animations distract you from the beauty of the game. The weapons are horribly over powered killing opponents with one shot to the foot while the player can survive an onslaught of close quarter unrelenting fire. There are a few weapons in the game but the variety needs heavy expansion and proper class organization. Player and weapon customization should be player choice, if you going to include custom skins and attachments in the game let the player choose which skin and attachments to equip or choose to go full default. So far the game seem to have 3 maps all of which are chosen at random when you play the 1 multiplayer mode, more modes and maps are heavily needed like (Free for all, battle royals, capture the flag, gun game, domination, kill confirmed, search and destroy, etc) also the ability to choose which mode and map you want to play.It may look as though this game is bad, but actually it‚Äôs a very enjoyable fully offline time passer in its early state, but it has a lot to improve and build on. It‚Äôs very hard to come across good graphic offline FPS games that don‚Äôt require any sort of internet connection. The things mentioned above is to help change this game from being mostly graphics to being a well rounded and fun totally offline experience.

I was 8 years old when Sonic came out in 1991; if it weren‚Äôt for Sonic, I wouldn‚Äôt have developed an interest in video games, and have loved his games since then...not including a few past and present flops (Sonic Boom the worst of it all). I‚Äôve even done much fan art and my own story writing/graphic novel work, as many fans of pretty much *anything* will do.     However...I am removing a star because of the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. When I first got this game I had to buy it...but it was ad free and wonderfully enjoyable. Now with the downgrading ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, I have to, in a sense, buy it a SECOND TIME just to remove the ads! I tried to restore the purchase of the game, but I only got an error, telling me that there were no purchases to restore. That takes the enjoyment of the game and tosses it in a pit of fire.     This issue is apparently a very large problem for all players who have already paid for the game. And if this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù moves to episode I, which I have as well, there‚Äôs going to be a lot more upset players who have already paid for the game(s).     Please, Sega, either refund all purchases that were done to originally buy this game, or automatically upgrade the game to premium for those players who have already paid for the game. It would make a whole lot of rather unhappy players feel better. If your looking for some amazing review about a game that costs 5$ so there‚Äôs no waste of money. The game is Ok. Then when you start your Sonic Adventure. You get a screen saying 2$ for no ads and get to play it offline so in total 7$ is going in the TRASH! Ok but if your gonna say I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúSonic hater‚Äù I‚Äôm not I try to defend him as much as I can against haters. And I love when they make a new game so I can get it. But when this game came out I got it and I was disappointed after awhile . Sure before when I first got it was fun and the part that made me hang onto the game was that I can play the acts from the first Sonic4 as metal Sonics story so after that it started to get boring. The Chaos Emeralds are really easy to get like the same as Sonic 2 but take out the hard part. So after I got the Emeralds I was bored how I get to the Death Egg fly and beat metal sonic super easy and then it sonic CD metal sonic race and uses that and then beat Eggmans final boss which is kinda hard and what you‚Äôve all been waiting for the ending. It ends when you escape the exploding death egg and take some air pods out and that‚Äôs it no other cutscene the credits rolls with sonic slowly going down from space.So I think the game is kinda.. No pretty bad but that‚Äôs my opinion so get the game if all that seems thrilling or anything so yeah. Okay, I'm going to start this off as bluntly as possible. A while ago, I thought that episode 1 was actually a good game. After looking at the game again though, I take that statement back.As for episode 2 though, it is INFINITELY better than episode 1. Everything got an upgrade, from Sonic's running animation and physics, to bringing back Tails and Metal Sonic.(also, thank god they fixed the physics.)I really enjoyed using Sonic & Tails' Co-Op moves. They all had a little bit of nuance to them, but once you got the hang of it, the levels are a blast to just speed through. Also, there‚Äôs a singular Red Ring to find in every level, alongside the 7 Chaos Emeralds. They are really fun to find, despite not getting anything for finding them all.The only things keeping this from 5 stars are the very jank parts of the game. Sometimes, I get hit by an obstacle or enemy that I clearly shouldn‚Äôt have been hit by. Also, there‚Äôs Episode Metal, which is supposedly unlocked when you own both episodes 1 & 2. I played episode 1 on my cousin's phone. I don‚Äôt own episode 1, yet I've played through the entirety of episode metal.Still a solid game though. ","Sonic The Hedgehog 4‚Ñ¢ Ep.

Sprint for the leaderboards in the sequel to one of the App Store's most popular endless runners, which arrives with a host of fabulous improvements, from overhauled graphics to refined controls, original minecart and zip-line challenges, and much more. Originally this was my favorite game. As time went on they made more and more variations and maps for the game, which was fine. Lately, however, now that they‚Äôre on the money grubbing bandwagon, I noticed fewer coins on runs when you needed them. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough with all the money they must make on selling people gems and coins, they‚Äôve added aggravating ads. I must admit that I tried to buy out of the ends and for over two weeks they still kept showing even after I received my notice that payment was received. However I must amend my previous review because they did contact me through email, and the developers gave me directions which did in fact remove the aggravating ads. The developers have since asked me to revise my review, but I had been ill for a while. The review is deserved, and I have brought it back up to a five star. I always did love the game I just hated the ads. And now for a very reasonable price, you can get rid of them too thank you so much for helping me with this problem. I apologize for the delay in correcting my review, but I have had some health issues which thankfully seem to be subsiding. It‚Äôs a great game! I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time (at the very least five years) and although I‚Äôve stopped for periods of time, I always come back. The new maps and characters are always amazing, and the global challenges are great.HOWEVER. There‚Äôs always a however. Other people have talked enough about the ads so I‚Äôm not going to talk about that. Something that bothers me a lot is that now coins and gems are practically useless besides Head starts and Save mes. Before, you could use coins to buy new characters or outfits and gems to buy new characters and maps. However, now you can only unlock the new characters on special events and you need to purchase the maps with real world money.As I said, I‚Äôve been playing for a long time, so I don‚Äôt know if the older characters and maps are still able to be purchased with coins and gems. But Pirate Cove, Volcano Island qnd Enchanted Palace (and its characters) can only be purchased with dollars and I think that‚Äôs very unfair.I understand that you guys need to make money, but I would hope that ads, Usain Bolt and people purchasing packages and coin doublers in the store would be enough. There‚Äôs no need to block most of your users from obtaining maps and characters, they should be able to be gained by putting hard work into the game and earning coins and gems.Sorry for the long rant, but I wish you would take these comments into account and make these assests achievable for anyone.

Some things could make this game even more amazing, maybe adding more levels, weapon and more customizations, for example maybe choosing difficulty in each misssion and survival level (this could be done by adding more zombie spawns or subtracting), and possibly customizing the survival match by choosing what zombies you want to face (like in boxhead where you select or de-select zombies like the acid spitting one and red one, altering difficulty and changing final score) also add  a kill count on the end of each level would be nice, maybe even add other ai survivors to help you on survival after outliving or killing a number of zombies. This game is near perfect, with these updates, it will be Godlike. In my original review I took issue with the sound problems the game developed after various iOS updates. Surprise! the game has been updated with 64 bit support and is ready for iOS 11. This is a creepy game about battling the undead as you desperately try to stay alive. You'll battle threw various areas as you try to not become an undead happy meal. Though maybe not state of the art graphically, it does what it needs to do to put the player in a world gone bad.

I will always remember in my life when I used to play this game all the time.                                       R.I.P The game runs poorly on any phone and is a disgrace to the unity engine - one of the easiest engines to develop on. This game runs at an incredibly low framerate, easily below 20 frames per second. Has horrible textures and ugly layouts. This is simply another cash-grab. Not even a good one in the least.Did I also mention that nearly after every action you do, you get an ad? Yep! As soon as you open the game, add. Once you select difficulty (only second menu screen) you get an ad. Next you finally get to choose your level. Once you do so, you get an ad. After taking a few shots, or even PAUSING THE GAME YOU GET AN AD. Simply put this game is a true waste of time and ‚Äúeffort‚Äù for whoever created this pile of trash. Do yourself a favor and do not give this company your time or attention. They will only lead to disappointment.

There is a glitch if you are running and you watch a video for a med kit or a gernade then you can‚Äôt die, I think this works because you can‚Äôt get damaged while running. And I would recommend you do this glitch in survival mode. Just go into a corner and hold backwards turn around and kill them when they come to you. And you can‚Äôt kill your self with your own gernades if you do this glitch, I WOULD DO IT QUICK BEFORE IT GETS PATCHED! Loving the game, would like them to introduce some male playable characters sometime, but other than that it's got solid gameplay mechanics! Characters play differently giving a fresh feeling to the gameplay and the story is the too shabby either. Co-op could use some fine-tuning. Hey guys.This game was fun to play and I liked the story mode. I think the company (Chinese origin) did well with the English as their second language! The dialogues, characters were interesting for an app game. The gameplay was smooth, but every time you get to a menu-option (cutting wires, guessing codes, even options menu) the screen would bug-out and it wouldn‚Äôt register your touches to navigate (skip an ad, watch an ad to revive, quit to the main menu). It made the game ultimately unplayable for me personally and I ended up uninstalling it out of frustration. If they fixed this I would consider reinstalling. Disappointing as their latest updates claim to have ‚Äúfixed bugs‚Äù, since this one literally made it so I had to continuously clear the app and reboot it every time it froze.

I am almost done with all of the levels, and it‚Äôs only been a couple of hours playing! I‚Äôm addicted! But, I have some suggestions. First of all, you HAVE to figure out a shorter way of getting between the levels. Maybe use a slider, or a level screen, I don‚Äôt care. I just don‚Äôt enjoy tapping 50 times through the level thing just to play one. It‚Äôs not very user friendly, if you know what I mean. Next, you should add some more ‚Äúattributes‚Äù to the levels when you make more. For example, I like the levels with objects that are slippery, or have a gravitational field. You should also do, for example, bouncy objects, like jello, or a trampoline. Or maybe sticky stuff, like slime, or glue, or something. Stuff like that, you know? Lastly, if you do end up adding more ‚Äúattributes‚Äù you should mix them up! Have an object that‚Äôs slippery AND bouncy! I can‚Äôt think of anything that‚Äôs slippery and bouncy, but I hope you know what I mean. Have fun with it! Feel free to respond!I love this game! Keep up the good work! üòÄüëç I‚Äôm really not one to write reviews but I wanted to express how surprised I was when I downloaded this app and began playing it. So first off, the concept is crazy, but also unique to say the least. I really downloaded this game with no expectations, it actually was recommended to be by the App Store and I decided to download it on the spot without looking at the reviews. I will start off by saying that if you‚Äôre the kind of person who likes to play games/apps that have any sort of story or any kind of purpose at all this is not the app for you. I will say however that the game design and idea are simple. You try to get bacon to land on a variety of random objects. Again, the controls are simple, the idea is simple, the game itself is simple but is well made! It‚Äôs just one of those apps you play when you‚Äôre bored, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that! BUT, the single most important thing that sets this app apart from the others is that it has VERY minimal ads. I‚Äôve only watched an ad one time and I‚Äôm one level 35 because you have the choice to watch an ad to skip a level. The lack of ads really ads to the vibe of the app itself, it‚Äôs super clean, simple, and minimal. I just did the first 50 levels and the hard one was putting the bacon on the.........ok, ok...the crossword puzzle. I have spent the last 1/2 hour giggling, chortling, and making funny noises as I tossed bacon from the frying pan onto/ into some pretty funny stuff..poor Francois Bacon...he definitely got his.....a fun, funny, and greasy game.... The bacon actually orbited the MOON!!! Check it out! I never recommend BAD GAMES...this is a winner....developers, keep the next levels coming!

The catch is that you don't get a life after each level so you are stuck with what you had left. It would be nice if you could keep going forever like the computer version. I'd pay another buck for 50 more levels. With just two controls (small jump, big jump) CityJumper has found the key to fun game play. The game is easy enough to figure out, but a good sense of time makes getting it mastered difficult. Lives are plentiful and levels reasonably easy to get past.

I saw the commercial during another game and it has a similar title to a game I knew I would like so I downloaded it. I have hated wall games all the way back to when it was very likely the only electronic game you could own. I‚Äôm talking pre Atari, the true Stone Age of games. I‚Äôm sure I liked it when I first got it but when it‚Äôs the only game in town and then the Atari came out I began to hate it the same way I hated hair metal. I loved it at one time but now it‚Äôs embarrassing. The depth of this game, the affect characters have, the interesting levels all surprised me. I may start looking for other games I‚Äôve excluded as result of this game and hopefully I can conquer my traumatic gaming past. I‚Äôm obviously exaggerating traumatic and considering actual trauma faced everyday I needed to point that out so I didn‚Äôt feel like a dick for putting that in. Great game even if you hate wall bouncers. So I think this game is excellent overall. It‚Äôs a unique take on the normal brick breaker formula and it works very well. My main issue with the game is that you cannot train (level up) your team members beyond the level you are as a player. For example, if you are player level 20, that means you can‚Äôt level up any of your team members past level 20 either. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you literally have enough potions to level up a character to level 30, if you are only player level 20, then you can only level your characters to level 20. Only until you reach player level 30 can you use the potions that you‚Äôve had since you were player level 20 to level up your team members to level 30. This is a really dumb way to make the game more of a grind, not sure if this was intentionally done by the developers to make you want to pay real money to speed up the leveling process, but either way, it‚Äôs dumb. Developers, please fix this system. You already have other things such as energy limits and runes that can only be obtained in later levels to make the game more of a grind and slow progression, so why have the flawed training system too? Please let us train our team members to any level we can with the potions and coins we have, regardless of the level we are as a player. I want to be able to level up my characters when I have the necessary resources (potions and coins) to do so, NOT when I finally reach the next player level. Edit: Well I never lost interest... a few months later... game is still super fun. Once you get into the rhythm of the game and start upgrading heroes it becomes more and more engaging. Plus updates are constantly adding features and responding to player requests. Great game. Original review: First want to say that this game is super fun and puts a cool spin on the hero collecting/upgrading concept. Now for the negative: So I know devs are trying to get people to spend premium currency, but this is ridiculous. I can play for 15-30 minutes (including 1-2 level ups and tower) before I‚Äôm out of energy and have to wait OVER EIGHT HOURS before my energy is completely refilled. That‚Äôs absolutely insane. 3 minutes per energy is ridiculous. It needs to be 45 seconds to a minute or the devs need to severely reduce the energy cost. I‚Äôm only 2.5 days into this game and I‚Äôm already losing interest.

One thing that is pretty dam funny is that you can run your sub into a mountain and it will start to climb it. Nothing more funny than to see an Ohio class nuke sub climb a 70m mountain and fly off it at 100km/h. I have pics of it but apparently I can‚Äôt post it here although in my opinion it is by far the funnest submarine game it had a bug that left me in awe. so yesterday after working hard for a while i purchased the ohio and there was no problems that day, but today when i selected hard mode 3 friends and 8 enemies, the number of enemies climbed out of nowhere and turned from like 1 out of 8 to 1 out of 12, and after a while of these bugs it started showing shockwaves from a nuke even though i hadnt launched one in a while and when it did that thats when it turned from 1 out of 8 slowly to 1 out of 12. hoping developer can fix it cause now im saving up for the okanaggan. P.S. please fix the bug developer. My review as July 2020 is not good. This game was fun to play but no support. There was an update and I lost everything. The fire controls are not working right. The graphics became irregular. So I did what is always recommended. Made sure it was backed up on cloud and offloaded. When Re downloaded nothing came back, I lost everything!!! Several Subs loaded with ordinance included a Poseidon. I hate that this game is having issues. Has same issues on all my IOS Devices, iPad and new iPhone 11 Pro Max. App support goes to a Blog page with nothing on it, no app support. This was a five star game before the update.

However, I have had problems actually running in-game :)One could say this game is an acquired taste, but it's stupid fun.I have only one suggestion: make a ""reset"" button in a corner of the screen or something, instead of just double-tapping anywhere. I end up resetting when I try and jump. Kinda disappointing. I'd honesty give it zero stars if it would let me... let me start with this is no QWOP. Instead of you pressing the buttons Q, W, O, and P you now have to rotate TWO joysticks each with four functions for the legs that the joysticks control... the only thing that this states with QWOP honestly is the title, the motivation, and the fact that your character is apparently named QWOP. If you had a hard time using four buttons then have fun with what essentially equates to 8 and half the time you legs are very much exaggerated and don't match what they should be based on where the joystick is moved.

Spectacular visuals and spellbinding music bolster an epic tale that pits you‚Äîone of Earth‚Äôs few survivors‚Äîagainst the monsters who stole our homeworld. Fighting in your War-Mech battle suit‚Äôs a blast, with legions of ghastly foes ready for your lethal sword and fearsome firepower. If you like games long on style and ambition, this one‚Äôs for you.  I don't really know where to begin with this one. I'd have to say that this is the best--ever--game in the App Store. I was hooked from the minute the intro came on and from just that I knew it'd be awesome. I don't commonly write reviews(this is my third), but I felt like my reaction to this had to be shared. It was hard to see how a game could be even considered with a ten dollar price tag slapped on it, yet surprisingly I felt relieved I spent so much. Well, not that I spent so much, but rather what I got was beyond satisfactory. All of the RPG apps out there, as fun as they are, find it difficult to compete with this. Graphics are phenomenal and there's no lag, at least not on my device. The controls are perfect for mobile, and there's a ton of moves and upgrades to use(but not so many it doesn't distract you from the action). Yes, and the action! Nonstop yet diverse with each level--perfectly balances the story and combat. So if you're like me and can't make up your mind for your life, I recommend this game to you, and I promise...it's worth every penny. I mean, it's about a human-operated robot with a sword and laser gun fighting mechanically enhanced mutants in a dystopian future. What more could you ask for? I don‚Äôt get the pricing strategy RELATIVE to other games in the genre/App Store. That being said, I‚Äôll drop 10 bucks on my way home from work on a pack of craft beer; I‚Äôd rather spend money on a quality game than have the alternative: ads, IAPs, money grabs, and $99 pack of ‚Äògems‚Äô, so thank you for that. It seems to me like a price more in line with competitors would allow this game to stay relevant in the marketplace longer, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a strategy behind all that somewhere in the business model: or they love their own creation too much to price according to others in the App Store. (Again, I don‚Äôt normally play free games, I like getting a self-contained game and gladly pay for it).  Pricing strategy aside, PLEASE update so the game fits my iPhone X screen before I beat it! The controls can be frustrating when you‚Äôve learned how a boss moves and trying to get out of the way before a planned attack: mostly because my left thumb slides off the small format game area (iPhone X) and the player just stands there and gets hit. But there‚Äôs a learning curve to it (again, still giving 5 stars)If you like hack n slash/ level up games; I would recommend adding this one to your collection. Thanks team!

Packing silky smooth, lightning-fast combat, Hyper Light Drifter is a blast‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre just admiring the scenery. First off, fantastic game! I love playing this. Awesome storyline and reaches back to my younger years of playing Zelda etc. I play it on IPad and yes I also wish the controls were easier cause you can‚Äôt get the dash room achievements at all with IPad control system. Here‚Äôs the thing that happened. In the southern zone, the one module room that turns out to be a fake module and then you have to fight a mini boss. So as I have understood, it is still a module right? Cause after I defeat it you go to the next room and then pull the real module. But on my map the fake mod is still highlighted pink and I still haven‚Äôt been able to find the eighth module. I have looked all over and tried to reasearch the maps but it always points me back to the fake room. Is this a bug? Should I make a new game and try again? I also noticed something that happened when I equipped the Tanuki sword once I attained it, there would be an error window popping up and the game shuts down. Now all that is said, these are all things that I‚Äôm sure starting a new game will hopefully fix but I wanted you to know about it. I am a really big fan of this game cause it‚Äôs just too much fun. It‚Äôs nice to play something that actually feels like a real game with substance and it looks like real love was put into the making of it. Cheers! This game is amazing! So much fun and very rewarding! Only thing that needs to be done is the ability to remap buttons. Certain upgraded attacks are too hard to do in combat because my thumb is controlling movement and I have to hit two buttons at the same time to do dash attack. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be taken care of! Thank you for this amazing game! Best purchase in along time!!! Additional feedback... So I‚Äôve been trying to collect everything before I beat my first play through of the game and I went ahead and researched where the outfits were *slight spoiler I guess* and I see that one of the outfits is locked until you can get 800 consecutive dashes in the dash arena... I‚Äôve had a great time with the touch controls but I‚Äôm not gonna lie it kinda is disappointing that I will never get that outfit because it‚Äôs actually impossible to achieve 50 consecutive dashes with a touch screen let alone 800 lol. I hope you guys can add some kind of compromise so we can unlock the outfit! I understand this could have been missed in hindsight sense it‚Äôs much more achievable with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. Here‚Äôs to being hopeful that I can unlock everything!!

I‚Äôve played the original game for many years back in the day and it‚Äôs always been in my top 3 games from my childhood. It was one of the ones I had the most fun in. I coincidentally saw the game ad on instagram (funny to think about it), and I immediately thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs back?!‚Äù (kind of expected since many old games have been moving to mobile). I saw that the gameplay looked totally different and initially it threw me off because my dumb self was stuck with the original image of the game. After a while, I gave in and tried it out to see what it‚Äôs like, because who knows maybe I‚Äôll like it too. I couldn‚Äôt be more right, I‚Äôve been playing for almost a year already. The game keeps interesting since there‚Äôs always a sense of progression due to it taking reasonably long to evolve and having frequently updates. Also would not consider it pay to win (which is awesome), since paying seems more for speeding up growth and cosmetics. Although there are a few things that could be improved (no game is perfect), the staff does receive feedback with open arms it seems. So far, amazing mobile game, looks and feels really unique, and it‚Äôs very enjoyable! Great job! Hello Chaser! We are really pleased with your feedback. Thank you so much for your continuous support for our game since the PC version. We're glad you gave this game a chance so you can continue your wonderful adventures! Feel free to contact our support at grandchase_official@kog.oqupie.com for any concerns, questions and suggestions for our game. We're more than happy to assist you. Long live the Chase! Big player of Elsword and Grand Chase on PC. A lot of people‚Äôs initial reactions to this before its release was filled with lots of doubt, but I am very happy to say that it was misguided, elitist doubt. This game is very fun to play even for people who are not familiar with the story, and very free to play friendly! (At least, upon initially release. 2 weeks in, still find it very enjoyable.) I would not recommend buying 99% of the microtransactions because the ratios of premium currency to real currency are not great. If they were more generous with prices, they might find more sales for currency, though I believe most money is made on skins which is later on going to be in this game. Also, if you don‚Äôt like Gacha, maybe avoid imported games like this, but I would say there‚Äôs a lot of ways to chance your gacha, so P2W isn‚Äôt very dominant imo.From a gameplay and aesthetic perspective, I would say this is great mobile game, especially if you cannot afford to spend 24/7 attention to it. There is no stamina feature, so you can play as much as you want (or can, anyway) or as little, limited only by dungeon limits and the strength of your characters. There‚Äôs lots of ways to earn resources and it‚Äôs very satisfying to get them!My biggest tip for newer players: SAVE YOUR B-RANK HEROES! You can get 3k premium currency (equal to 10 rolls in gacha) if you save all the ones you get from the story and level them up all the way. I started playing the original grand chase back around 3rd/4th grade when ronan was first released and i was hooked on the game ever since. I played the game until the servers eventually closed and that wasnt the best of times. When i saw that this game was basically a sequel to the original game i thought ‚Äúdoesnt hurt to try it out‚Äù. The main thing that hooked me to the original game was all of the special events and armors/characters that you‚Äôd spend days collecting items for, the amazing community back when the servers were almost filled and the gm‚Äôs that would be around to chat with players and play alongside of the players. This game kinda brings me back to the old days especially with the soundtrack and the characters that i used to love playing(ronan,lass,asin,dio). It would‚Äôve been nice if players that originally played grand chase when it was on pc couldve had a chance to kinda get something to display that they have previously played the original game, but thats beside the point. The game definitely is fun and still addicting(probably becauae of nostalgia) but i have ran into problems. The game does really enjoy crashing whenever i play and i dont know if its an issue with my phone but it kinda ruins the experience. Hi Chaser! Welcome back to GrandChase!

The graphics are great and you get a good selection of jets you are able to fly anywhere in the world. I‚Äôm no physicist or a pilot, but you don‚Äôt have to be one to remember Newton‚Äôs 1st Law: ‚ÄúAn object that is in motion will stay in motion unless an external force acts upon it. An example of this is when a jet goes into a stall. It doesn‚Äôt pull a Coyote and Roadrunner stunt and just stop on a dime and fall out of the sky. It still has some forward momentum and glides down as it slowly descends. It also means that upon landing the nose doesn‚Äôt smack down on the tarmac as soon as the back wheels touch down. If you watch a plane coming into land, you will notice that the pilot keeps the nose up as long as possible and then, after 500 feet, they slowly ease the nose down and TOUCH the front wheel to the tarmac. One thing that would help with this is if you had the AOA right on the planes.One other minor thing that needs fixing is the fact that you can‚Äôt see the water on the map setting while in flight.One jet you should add is the F-15 Strike Eagle Alright, hands down this is the best flight sim out there. However, it's gotten really flat since you can't really engage in combat. UPDATE:( well after finding out that air fighter is now a subscription I don't know what to think about rortos anymore) I spent money to buy the pro so I wouldn't have to worry about having to purchase new upgrades when new things came out. I saw that the basic ""air carrier landings"" has gotten a recent update with a new aircraft. Fortunately you need to buy all the aircraft if you want them. Meanwhile the pro version still has not been updated for almost a year now. What a shame. I was really loving rortos but looks like you guys have followed along other corporates... The graphics are phenomenal, the list of aircraft to choose from is superb but the physics of flight is just not right! Granted I am no aerodynamic engineer (YET) but I do happen to know quite a bit about airplanes and how they fly. So I will cut right to the chase. Problem One, the decent/accent rate is off based on the AOA. Now I won't go into any mathematics but an experienced flyer can clearly see that it is off. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE in future updates (sooner rather than latter) correct this problem by, 1 making the stall speeds much lower, 2 allow for aircraft decent even when the nose is pitched up at high degrees, and 3, when landing allow the user to EASE the nose onto the tarmack. Currently the game is programmed to slam the plane into the ground the second it touches down. So please correct that and all that I have mentioned for optimal realism!

The shortcut buttons are A+B, for 3rd Strike style overhead, and A+C. I have no idea what A+C does. A good shortcut would be C+D which is a game mechanic when your character is in TOP style. Imo the shortcuts are necessary on a phone. The game is a ton of fun if you can use the old school inputs. Definitely buy this. Would be 5 stars if the shortcuts worked correctly. One of the finest fighting games I've ever played. Full of depth, amazing characters and slick colourful animations. Not the best way to experience the game but definitely worth it to have this in a handheld form. I hope they continue the series someday. There has been a long drought in good fighting games. I'm glad to have this to remind me of the good times :) Thanks SNK and DotEmu. BTW the multiplayer didn't work for me. I'm looking forward to playing with people online. Also don't forget about Last Blade 2 and all the other amazing titles in the catalogue. PS for people complaining about the controls there are hotbuttons you can swipe for easier input and I'm actually shocked how well they got the controls. Peace! Pretty good for a touch screen game. I'm all about physical controllers,but this is playable enough for a phone game. It has buttons that make the harder moves easier to pull off if you just can't seem to get the touch controls down. Haven't tried with icade jr. yet, but I was more interested in being able to carry this game in my pocket and play it on the go on my break at work or something. It serves the purpose in my opinion. Grab it while it's 99 cents;)Update: Tried with icade jr. and it works pretty good. I can't figure out how to change the button configuration,but the default has it as A=upper left buttonB=lower left buttonC=upper right button D=lower right button So it works out good for me. Only complaint I have is with the touch controls. I agree with other reviewers that this game needs a c+d button while using touch screen. Besides that it works pretty good.Update 2:I have noticed occasional slowdown, but the game still runs good for the most part on my iPhone 5s. Still recommend if you can grab it at 99 cents.

I've played literally 100s of games like this, and this is a shining example of the genre, not to be missed Great game, beautiful graphics, addicting, and smooth. BUT there are some links that need to be worked out. The graze counter is the most evident. You can graze a cluster of 20 ""bullets"" and only get 4 points in your graze counter.

Challenging but not crazy hard and runs just the right length of time. Fun mashup of breakout and Space Invaders. I wish it kept a high score list and not just the highest score. Would be nice too if it had daily/weekly/all-time online high score lists too, with iPhone and Watch lists separate. But this is fun on Watch. Might even be my favorite Watch game. ...The developer has replied to my inquiry about this, and I am updating the review as such. He is trying to replicate the issue ...This would be my favorite game and would have five stars. Awesome sound effects, graphics, and concept. Gameplay is good too, but as two others have mentioned, there is a flaw in the control. The paddle will sometimes freeze for up to a couple seconds. So far, the developer's suggestion is to make sure your finger stays below the paddle. After trying this for awhile, it does seem to reduce the occurrence of the issue, but it does still happen occasionally, and I'm not yet sure whether it's due to my consciously careful finger placement, or just that it's working better randomly at this particular time.  See a game like ""Break Classic"" by BootAnt for the same control that works flawlessly.That said, I _DO_ still wholeheartedly recommend this game. The flaw isn't so bad that it's not worth the price. It's just a minor annoyance sometimes (and apparently only for some people).Also, could use a volume control... sounds are a bit loud. And after fixing the touch control, eventually adding tilt control (like on Jirbo Break) might be interesting! Still loving this app. Fun to play on the watch while waiting in line or out and about. Quick hit gaming with fun retro feel. They keep on updating app too to make sure it works on OS updates. Thanks!Great retro game for the watch. It's like space invaders & block out combined!

I had a meep growing up and ‚Äúsuper dynamite finishing‚Äù was on my meep. I was excited to see this app in the play store. Once I got it it wasn‚Äôt as fun as the original one that I had on my meep growing up. I wish that they‚Äôd bring back the original to the App Store. This update is not for the better, it‚Äôs for the worse. This version is super boring compared to the original The older game had tons of weapons, exotic fish, treasures, boats even a story told through the game!! This has dynamite and a bathtub boat... I don‚Äôt even think the graphics are better! 2.99 is way too much! The games hard pressed to be worth 0.99!

Etc. I mean, I haven't had this much tension( in an exciting way)and fun in a game for a long time. Please go watch some game plays before buying this game, because as you can see, some ppl bought this game knowing nothing about it, which gives them no expectations. For me, always trying to find an arcade old school game that dosent look outdated, this game is perfect for that. Apple, please don't delete more comments(since this game isn't spamming any 5star reviews) I reviewed this game( which I barely do on any paid games I bought)because I had tons of fun playing it, and I want the developer to make more! Know who's really spamming 5star reviews is important, Apple. From a gamer I usually do not write reviews, but I decided it was needed for this game. The graphics are amazing, it's very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The music grabs you and tugs you back into simple 8-bit music, and it fits well with the gameplay, even I, who would turn on music while playing games instead of listening to the soundtracks, kept the sound on for this game. Some people might complain the gameplay is repetitive, but compared to other ""free"" war or matching games, it's pretty tame, and takes it's own spin on things. Some people will whine because they aren't open to games that take a different direction. I highly suggest this game for any looking for a nice time waster, this is with no doubt worth the 2 dollars.

Would have been cooler if you could get these from the alien ships like in the original this game is copied from. When Chillaxian was released maybe two or so years ago I played it all the time and loved it. Like most apps, it made its way to the furthest reaches of my iPhone after a few months. I was so happy to see it featured in the App Store as a throwback favorite. I immediately downloaded it again and it's like returning to an old classic ‚Äî only its brand new and absolutely perfect for mobile. Oh, and the curved missiles are a brilliantly executed touch. They make you feel like you're throwing big left and right hooks at your opponent while solving the chase problem so common to Galaga. I'm guess the best I can say about this game is that the developer just gets it. Ages ago (in the 90s) a free game came with my Macintosh computer: 'Pegleg II': it was simple, fun, and addictive enough to cause all-nighters of gameplay. .. It was The Stuff. But come osX out went Pegleg II and I've been on a hunt for the last decade-plus to find a game at all like Pegleg with zero luck ...until now: enter Chillaxian: Very similar concept / feel and VERY fun to play. With Chillaxian you just maneuver - your ship shoots - this might not Sound intriguing until you get a feel for the controls: they're fantastic and allow the player to become immersed in the wonderfully lo-fi Chillaxian galaxy. AWEsome game and completely worth the asking price. ","Chillaxian, Madgarden, Games, Casual, Entertainment, Action, ios apps, app, appstore, app store, iphone, ipad, ipod touch, itouch, itunes"

In January 1980, a young and ambitious treasure hunter finds an ancient sanctuary hidden in the depths of an impassable jungle.  While exploring the temple, he discovers untold riches and powerful ancient artifacts. However, getting out of the temple with the treasure turns out to be quite a challenge.  The sanctuary is full of intricate deadly traps and its dark labyrinths abound in bloodthirsty beasts hunting for new souls.

I preordered this game before it came out and today it came out so I got it. I just started playing and I love the pixel graphics. The puzzles so far are fun and challenging.
