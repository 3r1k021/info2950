So first off, nice game! Easy controls, idle feeling, a very good game to play while you are winding down in bed! As a bunch of people have said, there are **WAY TOO MANY ADS** üôÑüòíI will get so bored of an ad pop up, I‚Äôll go play something else. It‚Äôs a very easily addictive game once you remove at least half the ads. I have no idea if you recently updated it so that the group will jump/move fast or the castle thing but I like it!üòç Really peaked my interest! However, seems pointless. Why build a castle when you are never defending it or something! As well as the ‚Äúopponents‚Äù names, we all know it‚Äôs a computer. üòñAll in all, it is a VERY good game! I already enjoy the graphics, the gameplay, and the whole vibe and I‚Äôm excited to see what you have in store for this app! üî•üî• Love the game it‚Äôs great it‚Äôs amazing beautiful masterpiece the thing you‚Äôve created. BUT the ads are just a little too common and secondly when I say no thanks to watching an ad so I can get a bigger prize at the end of a round that last thing I would have expected, was an ad after I said no to an ad if I wanted to see one at that moment I would‚Äôve pressed the button for the extra coins. Now I understand that ads is how you make money and you gotta hustle, but I think we both know that the dominant is the enjoyment of the games users so please lower the ad count and maybe new people or former users can cone back since there are fewer ads and make up for the revenue loss of decreasing the ad rate. So please just take a moment to understand where we‚Äôre coming from This game is a type of game called ad-to-win. Watch ads, win more. The game itself has some moments when it gets jittery and your inputs don‚Äôt match to what actually happens on the screen. As for how much fun this app is? Mediocre, not happy or mad to play it. It does have some pros though. I do like the upgrades along with the character customization makes it feel more like a game than a money grab. As for me, I found that you only need a little skill to actually accomplish the missions. Would I recommend this app? Nope not really. There are much better apps out there that provide more entertainment. Lastly, the company who made this game, make your sound bites better. They are bad. "

I wanted a cheap alternative to Minecraft. But, honestly, don‚Äôt cheap out and buy this one. After my experience with this demo it really doesn‚Äôt appeal to the audience of Minecraft. It doesn‚Äôt have the expectations Minecraft does. I can understand that Microsoft is a big company and can push updates regularly, and come up with many unique things in their game like the Nether, the marketplace with community created maps, behavior packs, music, texture packs and so much more! For a couple extra dollars, you can have an overall better experience. Don‚Äôt cheap out on this game, it just isn‚Äôt really worth it compared to its competitor. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a direct ripoff, either. I would rather label it as ‚Äúinspiration.‚Äù Now I‚Äôve played most god these games and I love them, but I‚Äôm gonna suggest some more things to enhance the game.Try to add ruined military operations from the USSR and the US, like adding tanks, destroyers (RARE), and (LEGENDARY) an bomber or jet fighter, I know this is kinda modern but it adds a lot of history of what might of happened on a area.(Add submarines if possible too please) And also add more guns, like a AA turret to get rid of NPC fighters, (this is rare and they might take you to a somehow operational base, unless they think ur hostile, (don‚Äôt hold a weapon) and also add MG guns and old WWII rifles and assault rifles, this will enhance how much u can use to defend a area.Last suggestion : add NPC soldiers, boats, and planes. And a radio, also some medical equipment. This will give a challenge if they are allies with you and they could help you out somehow. But be warned, some will be hostile if you hold a weapon. Unless they already met you and know ur safe. And I‚Äôm done with the ideas. But dev if your reading this thank you for creating these games and I hope you take my ideas, I also hope it‚Äôs not too much for the game and too much to ask. So I love this could you add flint & steel and steel armor also add s a shield and iron gold diamond netherite and add enchanted books anvils and a portal that leads to the nether and another that leads to the enter dragon and add seed for it and add it to where it is not very hard add a tutorial when you are new to the game from building a house or a camp site on survival and add a bell and villages and more furniture like a switch that connects to a nearest lamp and add lamps to the game Like the one in the actual Minecraft that‚Äôs not copy right make your own bell that‚Äôs way different from the bell Actual bell that‚Äôs cool and add five nights at freddys and servers and multi player where you click play it has worlds friends servers multiplayer worlds.

First of all, The coins mechanic is broken. When I booted up the game I looked at the classes and decided on being a stealth/sniper, so I wanted the recon and invisible class, and a good sniper and maybe a melee weapon. This is unattainable without dozens of hours of work, and it took me (I counted) 63 full games to get the invisible class, (pretty low level.) FIX THIS! It should take a maximum of 25 games to get 1,000 coins and get a low level class. Still a lot, not the 80-90 that it is now. The only other flaw I saw in this game was the maps, which are made out of very basic slabs of grey and black and white, with ought any curves or design or anything. Make them better, and THEN I will spend money on your game. I really like this game but it is really starting to get on my nerves. First it is impossible to get money. In a good game I‚Äôll get 20 coins, and some guns cost 9000. Thats about 450 good games. Second the guns are rip offs. The default AR is better than half of the paid for guns, and the 900 dollar pump shotgun is ok. Having the 900 dollar one, I grinded for the 3400 tactical one... I have never used a worse gun. It does 28 damage... 28!!!!! And all you get in return is 2 more ammo and a slightly faster firing gun. I spent hours of my life for something that could barely kill a worm. Furthermore, 80% of the time I‚Äôll shoot someone and the damage will only be counted hours later, while I‚Äôm dead. Then the other 20% of the time it won‚Äôt do any damage. I‚Äôll be shooting someone with my rip-off gun and they‚Äôll just be standing there doing nothing. Also that ripoff gun I purchased can only be used for one character... one!!!! Speaking of characters, you give zero information on them. Now the only way I‚Äôll choose who to get is based on whether or not they look cool. The only reason this isn‚Äôt a zero star review is because I love the consent and overall game. But things need to be fixed. I love MilkChoco and I love the new stuff added to the game, but there‚Äôs some stuff I can‚Äôt ignore, starting with;The Blade Skill: It does WAY too much damage and is almost unreactable. Most classes can‚Äôt take it at full HP and the tankier classes are crippled by it. I would love it if you lowered the damage output since it‚Äôs really annoying to deal with.2: Skill balancing in general: While the blade skill is overpowered, the Myocat skill is underpowered. It only does 130 and while that‚Äôs a lot, every class in the game can take that kinda damage and this is a game where most of the weapons you‚Äôll have are guns. If I have to go close range with a signature skill, I want it to be worth it. Either buff Myocat skill or change it to be a support skill or a different type of offense. 3: Connection. Even on my strongest internet, the game still lags a lot and I can sometimes can‚Äôt log in.4: Coins. You‚Äôve heard this a lot before, so I‚Äôll keep it brief. With the newer guns and classes being more expensive, MilkChoco veterans like me have to grind for hours to get enough coins to buy it. I can‚Äôt get the new Mago class and I‚Äôm sad because it seems really cool. If you increase coins given(about 100 or 200 coins per match), or lowering the price of guns so the coins that we do get are worth something, it encourages smarter gameplay and experimentation with different guns and classes. Other than that, the game is amazing! I love the new Assault map! "

There is a good wealth of content included in the application concerning information of all kind. The only area that I can tell that could use more data is Grand Theft Online. Maybe in the future this section will be beefed up. Besides that the app seems to fire on all cylinders. If you are a owner of this game, you need to own this manual. This manual is an ultimate guide into the great and grand world of Grand Theft Auto V. Every single person who owns the game shall own this! It feels incredible to play the game and just click on the app whenever you need to check something out like the map.

Thanks! I do hope that the game will be updated with more content and incentives besides hats etc. Hope that one day you guys will create a complete super Mario land clone ;) It's a fun little game. I've always liked platformers like this. The problem I have with this game is it's is somewhat glitchy. I often run into invisible walls and sometimes I get sunk into the ground. If you are jumping from the edge of a platform, it will not allow you to jump twice,  assuming that the jump was already on its second jump. In the 12th level, I keep getting stuck between the rail and the ground when I am riding in the rail cart... then I die and have to start the whole level over again.  Little things like that can ruin a game. I hope they improve this game, because I really do like it and it is worth a play through even with the glitches. "

Overall, I enjoyed my short time with this game. Sometimes a loss felt out of my control, but at least the Continue system is generous. Some interesting twists in combining combat with pinball, but there‚Äôs a limited amount of content and depth here. Would enjoy new content in the future. As is, a fun way to kill a few hours. Great concept, love the Game Boy Pocket grayscale art style, and there are plenty of different screens/tables to keep me entertained. However, this game is almost impossible to play because the left flipper only works about half the time, and it‚Äôs nothing but infuriating. Also, the pause button and magnifying glass button are in a terrible location on the screen; they‚Äôre right where I want to have my thumbs to use the flippers. And the fact that the magnifying glass icon starts highlighting itself every time you enter a new screen because it wants you to press it and read about the goals in the room is super annoying. Why would I want to stop the action to read the goals? Either make the goals more apparent without instruction (which I actually think they are, so it‚Äôs redundant) or have the goals flash on screen like every other video pinball game on the market.This has the potential to be a really fun game, but between the ONLY action input not working properly, and some questionable design and UI choices, I‚Äôll probably never be able to actually enjoy it.Definitely do not recommend this game in its current state. A fun game... when it works. As other reviewers have said, there is an issue with the flippers not registering being tapped which is really frustrating. Also, there is a magnifying glass that appears in the lower left corner that you can tap on to tell you what tasks you need to perform, but the game doesn‚Äôt pause when you do so you‚Äôll most likely lose your ball. Also frustrating. It‚Äôs a shame cause it‚Äôs a fun concept but until these bugs and issues are fixed, I‚Äôd stay away. "

At the bottom screen you can pick the song you want to play once you unlock them. The way to unlock songs is written on the locked song such as ‚Äúreach exactly 100 points.‚Äù Beat Stomper is fun, colorful and visually hypnotic way to kill the time and with great music too. This game is amazing. From the art style to the tracks. The difficulty is well scaled and keeps your heart beating and your eyes from blinking. The only minor problem I have is that there isn't much customization. While changing colors, tracks, trails and other effects is outstanding, I still wish we could customize our character. Maybe we can gain coins from our runs and use them to buy characters or complete more challenges to gain access to them. Another idea is a casual and competitive multiplayer. It could truly connect the massive amounts of players in this game. Other than that, this game is a beautiful and challenging game of colors. I totally suggest getting it whilst it's free. "

The graphics, music and gameplay will please devotees of the 80's arcade experience.The two things I DON'T like, however, are that there doesn't seem any way to save one's game, and if one is foolish enough to do something else on one's iPhone with a game paused, that game is GONE. Since a game can be pretty lengthy, this seriously compromises it's casual use, which is what makes so many games great. Also, it doesn't look as though there's any way to upgrade weapons or capabilities...and being a ""retro"" game that really isn't something that's expected, but I did find myself, after several levels, wishing I could change it up some.There IS an alternate weapon, the Laser, which is very powerful but a little clumsy to get to. Otherwise, the controls are exquisite!$1.99 seems a little steep for a game this simple, but I'm certainly enjoying it! I worshiped Space Invaders back in 1981 on Atari.  It may have been the only Atari game that I actually flipped or maxed the score on.  I also loved Galaga in the arcade and it would be coin toss between that and Ms. Pacman.  Galaxoid is obviously referencing those two games, but with a nice modern flavor.  I love the boss fights, which add another level of difficulty as the gameplay gradually ramps up after you defeat the boss.  The little touches of interactive power ups and laser beams are a great addition.  While, I can see how some may disagree with your spaceship staying at the bottom of the screen the whole time, I disagree about the touch controls being terrible.  they could stand to be a little more like Plasma Sky, but it's fine the way it is. Maybe the addition of an auto shooter could be cool, but it's not necessary.  Get this game if you love Space Invaders, Galaga, or modern iOS shmups!!  It will have a permanent home on my iPad, for sure. "

The maps need to be bigger. The maps size seems a bit to small for 3v3 game. You get constantly get hit by every one and it feels like you can‚Äôt escape.2.All the cars feel the same. You should add some changes to each car making some faster or making some hit harder. Make the cars have unique traits to add more to your game.3.We need more. Right now there seems to only be one 3v3 game mode against bots and I know that you plan on adding multiplayer but don‚Äôt stop there. You can add 2v2 and 1v1 game modes with smaller maps for 1v1s and larger maps for 3v3s.These are all my complaints for now. The game is still wonderful and I will continue to enjoy playing it. Just in case the title isn‚Äôt completely visible, this game is essentially rocket league but with bots far worse than the rookie AI, and that includes your own team. In other words, while it looks like a 3v3, it‚Äôs more of a Free for All, the reason being that the bots are seriously just programmed to follow the ball and boost jump forward whenever they get close to it.  So if it‚Äôs heading toward their own goal and they‚Äôre behind it, they while try to shoot it in to their goal (again, your team too).  Also, since they are programmed to just follow the ball, that can lead to you getting completely surrounded by both teams, and unable to boost jump or even pick what direction your driving in. Note, this game will make it seem like they are real people by giving them unique names that you‚Äôd typically see online, and I almost fell for it, but if you play long enough, you‚Äôll realize that all of them are bots just following the ball, which makes the games rather boring.  You can also kind of tell that it‚Äôs AI because you ALWAYS spawn in the middle, and that‚Äôd be very unlikely if you were truly playing with real people. My suggestion is to either update the AI so they can actually function properly, or add a PVP mode. I deleted after realizing the ads come up between every game and get gradually longer.  Also, you want to charge 20 dollars a month for access to 5 cars and ‚Äúabsolutely no ads‚Äù.  I‚Äôll pay to remove ads from games if I like the games because I understand developers need to monetize an app somehow, but seeing that this recurring payment gets you ‚Äúabsolutely no ads‚Äù is suspicious to me and lead me to delete the app.  But a recurring payment of 20 dollars a month or 7.99 a week for 5 cars is insane.  That is substantially more than a Netflix subscription or Apple Music family plan.  Do you really think those 5 cars provide more value than those services? Not a chance.  I think you‚Äôre almost knowingly doing that so that some children click on it and it becomes a recurring payment for their parents to foot the bill.  That or people who literally don‚Äôt care about what value they‚Äôre getting for their money.  Enjoy the short period of time your app will be popular because it‚Äôs clear you care about one thing and one thing only. "

I was surprised when I got this game because there were no ads. If you are annoyed by ads (like me) buy this game. The only reason I bought this game was because I play with LOL dolls. So what do you mean by ‚ÄúI have some suggestions‚Äù? Well, this game is kind of simple and plain. All you really do is play a mini game and collect a doll. Kind of like LOL dolls in real life- you just collect LOL dolls. Maybe you can spice this game up a bit up by adding more mini games for a little variety, you know? Maybe we can actually be able to scan real LOL dolls and play a mini game where they walk around and, oh, I don‚Äôt know, try to get to their capsules by passing obstacles before they run out of lives. That‚Äôs all, so bye! Hope you can improve the game! üòÉ I found five glitter ‚ú®  globe lol dolls. Their name are : N.Y.E.Q.T, miss snow, bashful Q.T, bold B.B,and sleigh babe.  I need seven more to find. I need to find the objects. Nye has her perfume. Ms. Snow has her magical snow book. Bashful has her bright flute. Bold has her journal. Sleigh babe has her sled. I show my sister the surprise. Let me know when you‚Äôre ready for the next lol doll. Now we need to find figure 8. She loves to skate with her ice skate. The wicked witch of winter has figure 8‚Äôs skates. The wicked witch of winter is melting in to water. Sleigh babe got the water which was the witch and drink it. The lol dolls are living with me and my siblings and my parents üë©üèø‚Äçüíºüë®üèø‚Äçüíº. I love this app but when I was around my sisters, they yelled at me and I got in trouble because the lol dolls were talking about them. On pointe is a fairy lol doll. I hope my advice with snow leopard is doing better. She has a little leopard cub. The cubs are sleeping. Snow leopard. I am stuck with witch baby. I am popular. The popular girls walked up to me and said: GO AWAY, LOSER! I am not a loser. I am a winner for my lol dolls friends üë≠. The boys in my class hates lol because they are creepy but they are not that creepy. I like her teddy bear and hug me. We have all the lol dolls glitter globe.

I love this game! And... there‚Äôs a few things that can be updated but.. this app is so underestimated. Listen.Ok, first, the new update where one your done with a map you lose all your items makes it much more challenging! I love that! However, you can save up 40 coins to keep your items. Also, you don‚Äôt HAVE to pay for coins. As you play, you earn more coins! And, there is another way to earn dolls nobody knows about! Just click on the spy glass in the bottom right corner and look for emojis every day for a week for a new, free doll! Now, they could have advertised that more but, it‚Äôs all good! So, this game is great! BUT WHERE ARE THE LIL SISTERS AND PETS? That‚Äôs the only thing I don‚Äôt like. WHERE ARE THEY? Also with this game, it‚Äôs free and it dose not need internet! This is a dream for parents because, your not buying the app, your not buying lol, and this is a LIFESAVER in cars, planes, and power outages.This app definitely deserves five stars! Thx! "

It seems simple at first, but it's quickly gets more difficult and you have to move quickly to keep your power up. Go for the charge ups in the later rounds, they refesh the suit energy. Get multiplayer scoreboard too, I wish more games added this. So far I'm #2 on the top scores. It's a steal for $1. Absolutely amazing graphics, and so much fun!!!

HappyTap is a mobile game that gets users looking for positive triggers in a race to best their score. It has all same the benefits as other games. In addition, it can also provide psychological wellbeing and reduce mental health problems. HappyTap is based on the CBM (Cognitive bias modification) paradigm of attention training in experimental psychology. In the game the user is tasked to ""find the smile"" in an array of faces with varying emotional expressions. HappyTap includes elements from games (gamification) to make the task more engaging and exciting. The task is designed to reduce attention (bias) against rejection and pessimism, and increase attention towards acceptance and optimism by turning attention to the positive stimuli through repeated exercise. In research CBM has been found effective in reducing mental health problems such as social phobia, mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  Gameplay features: ‚Ä¢ Find the smile in an array of faces with varying emotional expressions in a race for the top score. ‚Ä¢ Two game modes: Burst and Action. ‚Ä¢ Bur score.

Also, im really not sure what the tier up level does for the builders as there is no help screen. But i love this game so much as there is no forced ads. And no forced buying to progress in the game. As the title says, this game is fun for the first bit. I opted to pay the ~$8 for the double income and the ad-free gameplay; it speeds up the game, but now after running through the 21 levels about 6 times, I have maxed out the facility and supporters pages so I have no use for the gems you get at the end of each stage(10k+ in storage). Also I have maxed out the worker page at 100 ranks in speed and cash, with 160+ workers. So now I have nothing to buy apart from a worker every couple of levels, but I just keep building the same 21 buildings over snd over... this game needs more variety in levels and something else to spend gems on as even without paying for the ad-free you could still run out of things to use them on by the 10th playthrough. Now I‚Äôm not talking about completely removing ads 100%, that‚Äôs just stupid. I‚Äôm talking about removing ads from the upgrade buttons. Remove the ads from menu button. Stop reskinning games for a quick cash grab. If you spent half as much effort in making a good game with NON-INTRUSIVE ads you‚Äôd make so much more money due to more people playing, watching ads they want to watch, and buying packs of in game items.Look at games like Egg Inc., Pick Crafter, and a whole slew of others. Look at Crossy Road. No intrusive ads and it made over a million in the first year it was available.This game and plenty of others like it will keep getting 1 star reviews from me until the devs learn to properly implement ads.

Problem is, this is not a game that's easy to translate to iOS.  The controls are awkward, but the worst part is the broken ""sprint"" function.  Good luck trying to get it to work, because there's no consistency to when it does.  It works when it wants to.  The glitches aren't major, but are enough to distract you from the game.  Overall, this could be a great port, but the messy controls almost ruin the experience. At first I want you to have my sincere thanks for bringing this old but very important for its genre game on iOS. But still this port needs some serious improvements. Here are some great suggestions what to fix:- Do something about controls. Make them more adequate. I know you are trying to keep the game the way it was back in 1992, but ,since it's not MS-DOS(PC), I don't think people will complain about few new buttons that would replace some ""older"" ones. That especially goes to the combat part, which is very complicated with touch screen. Not to mention the ""sticking"" moment. Also make menu buttons tappable, not controlled by arrow buttons. If that means you'll have to change menus' layout, then do it. Just keep the art style. Again, this is not PC.- Would be nice if you could bring back the details of all 3D objects. Here they have less of them than in PC version.- Fix the music. Some of music tracks play where they are not supposed to. Music in the beginning actually plays when the doors of Derceto close once Edward/Emily go through them.- It also would be great if you could add voices that read texts(character info, letters, books, notes)For now that is all. I sincerely ask you to consider all these moments and do something about them. Thank you for understanding! Playable on the iPad.  The original game had pretty hard controls.  And it's even harder on the iPad mostly because the controller ""button"" has to be pressed by multiple fingers to be effective.  The double tap to run is very hard to do on a touch screen.  Also to turn while running you cannot slide your thumb to the side buttons to turn.  You can use a second finger to press the left or right buttons, and that makes the game at least playable. But I imagine that would be too difficult to do on an iPhone.  If they lengthened the double tap to run just a bit.. And made it so that the controls would let you turn with a single finger, then this port would be excellent. I still had  fun with it. This was probably the first survival horror game ever. And lead to the games like resident evil. "

I tried to look up how to troubleshoot this problem, but there were no results, so I thought I was the only one. Upon reading the reviews and learning that this has been happening for quite a while, it‚Äôs an even bigger problem than I thought. Aside from Falling Fred (which isn‚Äôt even available for the device version I‚Äôm using) none of your other games give me that same amount of satisfaction and nostalgia as Running Fred. C‚Äômon guys, you gotta get this fixed. Currently, the newest game you guys at Dedalord have made is football Fred, and I kind of find it as an unoriginal game. I was really hoping that you make a sequel to this game, because I‚Äôm sure that would probably be your mostly downloaded game, and because I also love this game, but can‚Äôt play it due to it crashing every time I start playing it. I hope you read this, Dedalord, because I think it will be a great idea for a new game to start working on.I know for sure I would love a sequel to running fred. Also, make sure gameplay stays exactly like this one, because I don‚Äôt want a clicker or a sports-related title, just running fred, but improved and better to play. This game is really good! I always used to play it when I was very younger, and I downloaded it again just because I thought it would be cool. The game was going great until I downloaded the character ‚ÄúIron Fred‚Äù. For some reason, I can not get into adventure mode, survival mode, or any mode when I unlocked the character. I can‚Äôt get in even when I am not using the character. Please fix this issue, because this game is amazing to play. I do not want to stop playing it. I also do not want to uninstall and reinstall the game because all of my progress will be gone.Edit: So it‚Äôs been a couple of months later and it still doesn‚Äôt work. I tried uninstalling and installing again but the game keeps my progress, which means I still have the Iron Fred, which means that I STILL can‚Äôt play. Can you please fix this glitch, there are many fans of your game who can‚Äôt play because of it. I really want to play this game because I love it sooo much, but I can‚Äôt. If you can‚Äôt fix the glitch, can you or somebody help me delete my progress at least so I can play. Your fans including me have been patient. "

But I think they need to add more cars and customize your cars. Also, I cant do damage anymore when I ram into them.I think it's a OK game. When you play some of the levels don't allow you to get the donuts, because your timed and have to finish the level. They also, need to add more cars to the Heat Version of Smash Cops. Anyways this is a pretty good game to play. So this game is pretty fun and it has some pretty good graphics but...Cons : the controls are good by the finger touch but then the finger gets in the way of seeing my car on the screen. And the other control pad option makes it harder to steer. Also be careful of swiping through cars in the garage because you‚Äôll see a small option below to buy the car with real money. But if you tap on the actual full view of the car it still goes through of you wanting to buy the car. Another thing I hate is the fact that after you use so many quick rams that you eventually run out of them and have to spend real money for more of them. But other then that it‚Äôs a pretty good game. Hello hutch games I am really impressed with smash cops heat I have no complains at all and I know you probably won‚Äôt make much more of smash cops heat due to you making more and focusing on your other awesome games I won‚Äôt complain but I will always consider and imagine this as a successful game and will always be but rather than that congratulations on being such a awesome band in the App Store I know your that the hottest band on the App Store but you are a good band and if you could I would like If you update smash cops but I understand if you can‚Äôt thank hutch games forever I support you and continue your reign of being awesome game developers!üëçüèªüëäüèª "

And this is one of the few games that actually supports my device‚Äôs native resolution and I get a beautiful full screen, without any ugly black bars that even BILLION dollar game developers, cannot seem to take the time to get it right lol..THIS GAME DOES. It actually utilizes the power of my device, and runs butter smooth while doing so! I‚Äôve owned my iPad Pro 11‚Äù 1TB since around January of 2019. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt my iPad get warm lol. Not hot, but just warm, yes the first time ever! Lol! So, that tells me this game is using my iPads beastly A12X CPU, and wicked awesome GPU, and some of the 6GB of ram that I have. I love this game, I was just playing it for about 20 minutes, and I just had to minimize, and come back on the AppStore to write a review about it. Excellent game developers right here! Very smooth! Very fluid, excellent graphics! This developer needs to make a ‚ÄúFirst Person Shooter type game‚Äù they would blow PUBG out of the water! PUBG still has big black bars on my iPad Pro 11‚Äù 1TB and they‚Äôve yet to add support for my native resolution even after nearly 5 months since launch. Thank you for making a game that shows off our devices so well! And please, try and make a different game GENRE. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!!! I love your game but I feel it is missing a bunch of other iconic jets. I do understand your game is still being worked on and I can‚Äôt wait so see what other planes will be added!I hope to see this game advance, it has a lot of potential! If possible I‚Äôd love to see helicopters at some point.  My overall rating on this game is 5 stars, it‚Äôs a really beautiful game and I love the jets in the game. I haven‚Äôt lagged much while playing this game either with only one or two of the occasionally lag spikes. I‚Äôd like to see a radar guided gun for some of the jets as it would make some jets easier to aim with, like the lower tier jets. Giving lower tear jets easier to aim weapons would make it a little easier to progress. Alliance credits, in my opinion the alliance credits are way to hard to get a lot of. Please make these credits a bit more numerous as upgrades get pretty expensive and it takes a long time to get these credits. I do love the Ace battle mode as it does pump out a lot of credits if you can avoid a lot of missiles. This is all I have to note on this game, I love the game, and keep up the hard work! Don‚Äôt rush this game as I may lose quality if it is rushed! Thanks. Overall this game is really ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, and fulfills all most of my expectations. The graphics are like what it says in the description: photorealistic. There are no ads in game to disturb your gameplay (in my experience), and it is a really smooth game. Although right now the game is good enough, I would really want more content and missions, though I know they would be coming in future updates. It would really improve the game if you could add historical campaigns (for the time periods that actually happened, like WW2), bombs that you can drop from planes, ground forces like tanks and infantry that you can support or fight, carriers and landing strips that you can return to in order to repair, and/or switch planes, and finally, an improved multiplayer feature, as the current one is pretty laggy. I know I‚Äôm asking for a lot, but in my opinion they will really improve the game, and the developers can install them in individual updates instead of a massive one. In all, this game is really awesome and it‚Äôs a great addition to your games collection. Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

It's been less than 2 weeks and the UI design of opening chests changed so that the open now gem button is on the opposite side of the queue button. I assume there were many similar complaints from devoted players, so props for listening to your customers, for implementing a fix so quickly, and for crediting the gems I spent. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I usually don't leave reviews. But the UI change of the chest interface in the latest update is aggravating. I don't know if the button to pay gems to immediately open a chest was moved or re-sized or what exactly happened, but my thumb's muscle memory of hitting the ""queue chest"" button from before the update has instead made me hit the pay gems button 3 times since the update. Something clearly changed, and it feels like it was changed for exactly this reason -- so that players would accidentally open chests by spending gems and either have to buy new gems or wait longer to collect free gems. Love the game, been playing for years. Love the new clan wars 2 update. But this is the first time it feels like a UI change was done to trick player, so no love for that. And I don't know if a second prompt existed before (are you sure you want to pay gems to do this? Y/N), but either one should be implemented or both buttons' original locations should be reinstated. I think that this game is amazing and is always being rebalance once a month to make sure there is not a over powered card that is in every deck here is a piece of advice to those struggling against mega knight use a card like minions minion horde or inferno dragon they take him out in seconds and can be used as a counter attack I have been able to get to challenger three and collect every single card except for electro wizard and I have only have had the game for a little over a year and I have found most problems with glitches are wifi induced I currently think the game is perfectly balanced and am thankful that their are people updating every 2 months to add so much content ( some times it becomes overwhelming) and every month a new list of rebalances i am so glad this isn‚Äôt a pay to win game which it so easily could be also in clan wars the level of your cards is based mainly on clan participation so maybe you should rally your team mates to participate more and increase your chances in winning and the tournament system could be fixed but no game is perfect so I just deal with it and it is obvious to see the effort put in to this game and when you get to a certain point in the game ( when you can be drafted into a   specific team and can earn money rewards ) they ban multiple accounts and I kind of see it as cheating in a way if you just try hard and think it through it isn‚Äôt that hard If there was only one thing about this game that I had to say about this game, it would be that it was made for anyone who was interested, which is pretty much everybody.I‚Äôm talking from the competitive to the casual, from the nerds to the trolls, from money boosters to the free to players. I‚Äôm talking everybody, and as a matter of fact, there are so many cards that are similar to one another but differ by just a little just so that you can find some comfortability. A way I would show this is with skeletons, goblins, and guards as they each vary in strength from the least to greatest but each costing 1,2, and 3 elixer respectively. Another one like the mortar is something to cycle, but the X-bow is more agro. And all 98 cards are so unique to where there isn‚Äôt a meta where one card power creeps the other. What‚Äôs better is that no other game does this, but it has appealed to every person in the audience just yet. There are some cards I would like to see, other cards that other people want to see, and some changes that are requested. This is why this game is still being worked on. If Supercell could find some way to work in the Boom Cannon from Boom Beach into the game or anything similar to where it could 3 shot a golem, that would be insane. Thing is, if everyone still isn‚Äôt satisfied, then the game need more work. This is how one gets closer to a perfect game, and we‚Äôve got to be close to it by now. "

But the storyline is over too soon. I got a new phone, redownloaded this app, and it's been less than a month and there's no story left (I play whenever there's a lull in the day).

I've almost 6 million dollars and nothing to spend it on except the occasional health boost in the arena or a laser cutter for rare emergencies.Knives would be great, maybe a sword option, I like another commenter's idea about the flamethrower, a sawed-off shotgun, sniper rifle, any of these would work. This game is great, and that can be a problem for the developers because great games need maintenance. We all want an update. I've come to love the minor glitches and integrate 'em as part of the game, so I'm not really concerned about that as much as I am wanting more story and weapons. It's a good game, that's why we want more! Great App! One of the few games like it where one doesn't have to be a big spender to play. Highly recommend it for zombie themed FPS enthusiasts. While overall good gameplay, it's not without its flaws. Would give five star rating if not for one major glitch in the system. Something that could be fixed if one of two things were included in the update: The ability to interrupt the reloading process, or the option to disable said processe's automatic function. In the current version, reloading leaves player unfairly vulnerable to attack: Unable to switch weapons, or use items until the process is complete. Would be more efficient if player had the option to equip alternate weapon or utilize item instead of being forced to wait for current weapon to be reloaded once magazine is depleted. Being able to swap weapons or utilize items during automatic reload process would work as well. The trade-off of having to restart the entire automatic reload process when reequipping the weapon with the spent magazine would it be acceptable, as player would most likely be out of danger by then. Please consider for next update. I really was never into games. So I carefully read all the reviews and they are right very easy to play and a lot of free options to get gold and money for more equipment. I even got a new phone and that was the first thing I downloaded. And if you create an account you can pick up where you left off which is awesome cause I had more then 1000 in money and 300 in gold. Also they have great customer service when it comes to earning gold by downloading another app. I also love that option because most games say they are free and then turn around you get to a certain level and you have to play to continue. They also have many missions option that tell you if it‚Äôs easy or hard and they also give you a hint on which weapons are best. And they also have many equipment options and when it comes to guns they tell you how powerful it will be. I can go on and on I really love this game. "

But then I got up to the room with the security turrets at the lab and what was a puzzle/story/adventure game suddenly requires reflexes that I, someone with a joint disorder, just don‚Äôt have. I tried‚Äî for hours‚Äî to get past that scene, and I watched play throughs, and tried to do what those players did, and I simply physically can‚Äôt. Usually when I encounter a game that‚Äôs going to need fast, calculated motion, I know it in the first few minutes and can nope out. This reminds me a lot of Life Is Strange in that it‚Äôs a game that I was able to play almost to the end and am now stuck because it is asking me to do something that is a physically impossible for me.  If you‚Äôre going to create a game where one scene has a radically different gameplay style than the rest, PLEASE either warn up front or have a way for players like me who can‚Äôt play in that way to skip the outlier scene. It‚Äôs so frustrating to get so invested in a game and then have to just stop without getting to know how it ends because the developers didn‚Äôt think about disability access. While I too spun around awhile coming out of the apartment building I was able to get around the glitches and finish the game. This appears to be a new game. The story was entertaining and I definitely think that minor glitches in no way should depreciate the fact that this is a five star game. You can fix glitches but the story/game itself is top notch. To the devs, I use IPad Pro 1st gen. I was stuck a few times in the air ventilation room too. I was able to either shut down to get out or just happen to hit it right. It almost seemed that the exit was off screen. Had there been a place that allowed me to save it, Along with your auto save feature, then I wouldn‚Äôt have lost minor progress.  During the airborne sequence it seemed that I had no control at all, I kept smashing into things. Maybe I was supposed to but even when there appeared something at the bottom of the screen I didn‚Äôt get it. Perhaps it was just me. The gyroscope is definitely touchy. I learned to slow down to keep it from looping. I wish there was a way to be updated in the game with new chapters (like an update appears that gives you the opportunity to purchase new episodes) as I look forward to purchasing the next one.  I only comment on glitches for your information, habit from beta testing. Thanks for hours and hours of good/fun entertainment. I like this game a lot. However, I am playing on an iPad Air (first gen), and the game crashes at the end of nearly every chapter, forcing me to replay it. The second time through it seems to save progress normally. The crash always seems to happen after the shield symbol ‚Äústutters‚Äù the second time.Gameplay is great. I love the interface, and moving around is intuitive. I enjoy having to choose the answer at certain moments. "

I think it should have an option to turn off device movement to look around and just have an option to turn it off. Other than that, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something fun for a road trip. Alright so the game is cool with how you build the guns but i do think the augmented reality should have a button to change because i have to sit up every time i want to play the game. however for the people saying that everything is to expensive try out slots. The 2 coin slot machine is good for coin building in the beginning but later on use the 4 coin one because in about twenty minutes i went through 200 coins and ended up with 47 plant seeds.  This ended up giving me over 1000 coins, however never use the 30 coin slots its trash. In the end the game is really easy to make money in and the main game is just for fun. Btw I played this game a while ago but i recently re got it. In short ive had the game for 2 days and im to the point to where i would be making 10,000 an hour i just dont feel like grinding and am waiting for a good spare hour. There is a glitch that on some levels the OPP shoots faster than the golden weapons and cheats. What the heck is wrong!? There aren‚Äôt many things to even do, and why did you have to waste money on Chances for plants!? Why is glass weapons a RIPOFF when they were TOO expensive? Why is the Aluminium pack 3 TIMES the price? Remove the pro pack also, it just makes people cry about like: ‚ÄúOoh, a pro guy used a 2x damage and barrel cheat, but I can‚Äôt do anything about it.‚Äù Also, remove the reload thing that you have to swipe down. Make at least a BUTTON! Why do you have to buy TILES just to be better!? It makes NO SENSE, make them cheaper! Also, the last thing, at least this game is good, but I‚Äôm warning you.

And in the options menu, you can change the controls for ""commando"", which from the picture looks like a first person shooter, but if theres only 36 levels, that means the last level is a ""commando"" level.

The controls definitely need work though (especially on larger screens).It would be nice to be able to resize the d pad and re arrange the buttons, and there should also be the ability to add a separate jump/roll button. With as complex as this I don't think that more buttons would be unwelcomed. You also can't rotate the screen. The melee button also should not make you go though elevators, because there's normally enemies right in front of them that you try to melee and end up going down the elevator.Overall super great content though, it's very very enjoyable and well worth the money (so long as it gets updated with better controls) The title says it all. I absolutely adore this game, I have bought it on the Xbox, my PC, my Nintendo switch, and now on my phone. It‚Äôs a very simple game, just pick an operator and run around either rescuing hostages, or killing all the enemies on the map. While simplistic, it is quite difficult, as your able to die very quickly by most enemies(which I appreciate) You may be asking, if I‚Äôm praising this game so high, why is it 4 stars instead of 5? Mainly it‚Äôs due to the lack of co-op. Any other platform this game is on, Xbox, PC, PS4 even the Nintendo Switch, has Co-Op and multiplayer. I understand the frustration of bringing in the mode while door kickers 2 is being developed, but I feel co-op could make this port of the game even better. Other than that, I haven‚Äôt encountered any glitches or bugs to harm my experience. Overall, an excellent game, and fantastic work from the developers. You guys should make a endless zombie mode thats wave based so you start on round 1 and the zombies are easy and every round it gets harder and zombies get more health and every round its different kinds of zombies and make it so you can change your loadout at the end of each round and be able to upgrade your gun with the money you make from killing zombies and with the gun upgrades should be like maybe you can have lazer bullets or fire bullets and be able to buy turrets or even call in a back up so that you can call up a npc to come help you fight but make it so they can die and you will have to get another one if they die but all these features are only in the zombie mode or you can do a mode with endless zombies or humans who shoot back but you have to make it wave based im telling you its gonna get good results from the community I promise That's a pretty complicated development you're proposing, but one worth pondering upon. We do have something designed along similar lines, maybe more down to earth. If we ever get to implement it, we'll sure revisit this too ;) No promises yet! "

The game is one of the best you'll find. There are absolutely zero ads, you don't have to pay anything to progress through the game, and the game itself is one of the most fun to play. The clans make it easy to have fun with friends and to make new Clash friends which you can dominate war and clan games with. The Supercell's customer support is top notch they always got people to answer questions, listen to concerns and suggestions about the game, help you with any bugs or problems you have. As an example, one time I lost my village with all its progress for some reason. (This happened to several games) I told Supercell about it and they found my village and gave it back to me right away.The only move I have ever really disapproved of was removing Global chat. Global was a great way to chat with people outside your clan and also the best way to recruit. The new recruiting system they added to replace global is trash. I can't get anyone good with it. On global I used to build clans from scratch in a day. One time I recruited 20 people in a day to my clan. I was only TH 10 at the time. I understand why you took it away Supercell, but would like to see (a) it come back (maybe find a better way to do it) or (b) come up with a new recruiting system that works better than the one we have.Other than that, absolutely brilliant game I love to play. Well done Supercell. üëèüëè Overall Clash of Clans is a very enjoyable game. I love being able to be in a clan with my friends and building it up will other good players. However, ever since global was taken out of the game, it has been much harder to find and get new non-rushed, kind, and loyal members to join our clan. I know global was taken out because many players abused it and were mean to other players, but I believe it was a very important part of the game to find new friends that you would enjoy talking to, and playing the game with. The new thing that helps find clan members (in my opinion) is not very useful. Most of the players are very rushed which don‚Äôt fit the requirements of the clan I‚Äôm in. One other change I would like to see is the time it takes for buildings and troops to upgrade. The gold pass is a very good option to shorten the times, but I‚Äôm still a kid without a job, so I‚Äôm not always able to use 5 dollars to buy the gold pass. I have gotten it many times before, but without it I‚Äôm struggling to ‚Äústay on schedule.‚Äù I‚Äôm a TH11 at the moment in the ending stages of it. I only have walls left and a few troop upgrades in my laboratory left. The troops left are dark elixir troops and I have no problem getting the needed materials, but the time is almost unbearable. This reason made me come to the conclusion of why I want the time to upgrade buildings and troops to decrease. Ok, so first I would like to start off by saying that your game is absolutely awesome. I play at least an hour a day every day and usually more. It combines fun, strategy, resource management, and action all in one magnificent bundle. I myself am a Town hall 9, but I rushed through the game way too fast and am very behind. Despite this, I love this game more than any other mobile game I have ever played. 10/10.The issue, however, is not how expensive upgrades are or how the game is super pay to win (it‚Äôs not). My issue, is the time. I don‚Äôt mind saving up my gold to strengthen my defenses, or get a exciting new building, even if it‚Äôs really expensive. I hate it when you finally get the 2 million gold for an x bow, and it makes you wait 3 days on top of that. It makes the game so much less enjoyable. Same goes for training troops. I love attacking and forming strategies with my troops. But it is kinda annoying that it makes you pay for the troops AND wait an hour and a half to even use them. I don‚Äôt mind some of the waiting, but waiting for more than 1 day for a seven dps upgrade that also costs you 1.5 million gold is ridiculous. I‚Äôm not saying remove the wait time, but definitely cut down on it by quite a bit.But anyway, this game is super awesome and I don‚Äôt mean to make it sound as though it‚Äôs a bad game. I really do love this game, it‚Äôs a brilliant work of art.

To start, there is no way to customize sound settings. The controls are awkward and there is so much lag that it makes playing glitchy and a bit frustrating. It crashes in me sometimes, especially when navigating to different packs. A few of the games seem impossible to solve for one reason or another and there are no hints, so that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre just stuck. Please fix! I paid money for this app and so far  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been worth it. I hope I‚Äôll get update this review but right now it‚Äôs really hard to enjoy this game because of the automatic repeating movement if you tap too long. Is there any way you can increase the delay for the repeating of movement in a direction? I can try to get used to tapping ever so lightly to move only a single space but as soon as I forget how sensitive it is I suddenly leap 5 spaces forward into water or fire. Having the option to toggle between auto repeat movement and single space movement might be an option too. I‚Äôd just really like to focus on the challenge of the puzzles without having to be ever so careful because the interface is oversensitive.Playing on an iPhone 7 Plus. iOS 11 I liked this game, very nostalgic but it needs to be more responsive, (I wish the music was there!!) BUT, the big thing is I got to level 21 and it crashes EVERYTIME. It has now become unplayable. I paid for this app- it‚Äôs annoying. I tried to contact developers but it brings me to a forum, no direct contact. "

I was just wondering if you could make a new game mode with just a single player and bots. So that if the player is new at a .io cell game, they can practice with bots. There could also be a difficulty changer and you can chose if you want to play with bots on different game modes, such as, Bots with Instant Merge. Or Bots on Crazy mode. Stuff like that. I hope you read this and please do reply, I am sorry if I don't reply but I will try my best to find my review every day to check if you replied. Have a great day, and thank you for making an awesome game. :). I love this game, I love the gamemodes! There are some problems. There are way too many ads, please reduce number of ads or have an option to remove ads. Needs more servers, too many people in each server. The ultra maps are way too small, I can't spawn in without dying instantly. Can you guys make it so we can play against bots in almost all gamemodes? If you do add an option to play with bots when will it be released? I want to see this game succeed, I love this game, please reply soon! :> Hello all of things that your suggest will be released, but now we are working on Google login, because so many people haven't facebook accounts or have trouble with it.

That‚Äôs all the problems that I can think of as of right now, so please if you can fix this problems it would be great. I‚Äôve just started playing this game and it is amazing, the graphics and the amount of detail is just wow! It‚Äôs very competitive and you can really fully costume enjoy your character, the best part of this game is that not all the content is downloaded at once, I like how you have to download stuff because it make the game more smooth and it allows you to play online on hotspot! There‚Äôs a lot I like about this game and at this point I‚Äôm not having any issues with it but I keep seeing some reviews that are not so great. Keep up the good work! I would also like it if you added more game modes that would introduce the player to a whole other gameplay/game style like mini games such as Capture the Flag or 1v1 solo duel, game modes like that would really be enjoyable to the community, I would also like to point out your rewards because they‚Äôre awesome! Lucky royale and daily rewards are probably the best for beginners because it atleast gives good rewards to those who are not that good at the game, unlike fortnite that makes you Pay for their currencies, free fire has several different currencies that get you something u want and you don‚Äôt have to pay a single penny to earn, u can just earn the currencies by completing the game and just basically playing the game, I love this game and I would really hope there would be more updates to improve the game style because this game finally makes it fair to everyone with its currencies and gameplay! Edit: As mentioned below Ive lost interest. Its the same thing every game! Go on a kill streak, Game gets serious lag spike i die instantly, and then i level up and get gold but theres nothing to spend it on. Oh yeah and ever since i logged onto FB not only has connection been bad but i haven't been able to select load outs anymore.  This game is great but the worst of this game is the greed. :/ I know fashion has nothing to do with the game but everything costs diamond barely anything costs gold so once you play it just gets old cuz your not gaining anything from it and you cant get diamond unless you pay real money. So already you've rendered gold useless. Rather than making all the clothes and stuff cost diamonds make most stuff cost a lot of gold so people can be motivated to keep playing and all the rare and unique clothes and stuff can cost diamonds which you can get by competing in events and stuff or completing challenges/quests. Do that and I give 5 star. "

The runes that you at the session portal is sooooo helpful!!!!!! I told my friends and cousins to download this game and they like it to! After you get flying barrel ,Big bouncy bomb, Core-tri bomb and OVERSEER you literary just broke to game! And brawl pass is sooooo helpful you can get eggs gold skins emotes!

In the events you can win the event and get eggs AND clones you want!!!! I won a event and got a BLAST FISH!!!! When I opened to tribe egg I Got a FLYING BARREL and after it level 2 it did 1000 and something damage to the opponent‚Äôs tower!!! I‚Äôm my opinion FIREBALL is sooo good if you use spiky to kill the barrel the bomb birds will come the use the fireball To kill ALL of the bomb birds!!! Thank you For this GREAT game!!!!!!!ü•≥ü•≥ü•≥Ÿ©(ÀÉÃ∂ÕàÃÄ‡Ø∞ÀÇÃ∂ÕàÃÅ)Ÿà!!!!!!!!!! All in all this game is very enjoyable. I liked how it was in the same style as clash royals but at the same time a completely different game. I was having a lot of fun until about the point where I hit the frozen noon arena. Up until this point, I had been using a lot of the same cards that I had got since close to the beginning or at least the ones I had been using I had been using for a while and have played many matches with them. About this time I realized something that almost ruins the game for me, you are essentially punished for using cards u like repeatedly. The whole system of cars trophies is good for the gems but after a certain point, it‚Äôs almost impossible to earn trophies with them. Basically if you play with a card enough, it will reach a ‚Äúhigh trophies‚Äù status which lowers the amount of trophies you can earn from winning a battle. This gets even worse when u do this with multiple cards and play someone with a lot lower party trophies. Why am I punished for using cards I like? Eventually, this could get to a point where I can‚Äôt earn any trophies at all if all of my cards end up this way. Developers if you are listening, please get rid of this system, if I like certain cards and want to use them more than others, I should not be punished for it. I love this game and have been playing it for a while . Im in the 3000s when it comes to trophies and ranking but my gosh every time i come across an egg i get the same things over and over again and waiting EIGHT HOURS FOR EARNED REWARDS DELIVERING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS NOT FUN. I play against people around my ranking and im always seeing loads of new clones being used and yet i never see them pop up for me. Ive been recycling the same clones practically the whole time since i started and not for nothing those clones that i keep seeing are very powerful and bust through practically everything i throw at them making challenging people even more difficult cause im not getting anything that can match up to their clones. If the random findings of clones in the eggs can change a bit so its not THAT rare as it is now . Ill definitely be more happy than i am now playing this. Also if you can cut down The time frame for eggs to hatch or allow watching ads to instantly open them or to get green gems more often that would be amazing as well!Regardless the game is great and a lot of fun and can be funny at times !

Although this game has autoplay, it is easily turned off, and it usually only reactivates itself for very short quests (I would prefer that it never activated though). It‚Äôs usually pretty simple to navigate without auto on, but I find it odd that distance arrows appear while on auto, but not on manual control (obviously they‚Äôd be far more useful in the latter-I‚Äôm pretty sure the AI doesn‚Äôt need the arrows). One small issue I‚Äôve noticed is frequent differences between spoken dialogue and subtitles. It can be quite confusing at times.A far larger issue to me concerns customization: there are costumes, but they don‚Äôt fully address my main issue, which is hairstyles. There are no hairstyle options while customizing your character, and all of the hairstyles available to purchase currently are tied to their respective costumes. Also, all of the hairstyles for female characters are quite long. I‚Äôd like for my female character to have short hair, but right now that‚Äôs not an option unfortunately.Other than the customization complaint-I‚Äôm really enjoying the game so far (and I really hope the dev will consider bringing the autoplay options in this game to their other games *cough* Novoland *cough*). I absolutely love this game. It‚Äôs really cool, the graphics are good, the quests are just hard enough so that it can be challenging but not so hard that you want to rage quit. I like all of the dungeons especially and all of the bosses you fight there. My only complaint is how hard it is to get new pets and mounts without buying them. If you want a free pet, you have to do a dungeon or a special event. Those are pretty fun, but for me at least it has been really hard to get a pet. I have done way over 100 dungeons and/or special events and I have only gotten one pet, not to mention a mount. And if you want to get mounts, you have to do the same things to get a pet, only with a much smaller chance of an already really small chance. Or, you can do the clan things and get those gold circle crown coin things, (I don‚Äôt know what they are called sorry,) and those take forever to get. I would just like there to be a easier and/or cheaper way to get pets and mounts. I think it would make a lot of players including me a lot happier. The only easy free mount I can think of were the golden night owl and dark moon lion. And the dark moon lion does not even stay with you forever. The easiest mount to get besides that would probably be the arcane broom, and that still takes some saving up. But overall, this game is freaking AWESOME and if you haven‚Äôt played it already DOWNLOAD IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING FUN THINGS ARE IN THIS APP ITS AN AMAZING GAME :D I‚Äôve Been playing in the memo RPG‚Äôs for a very long time the longest one I had played was World of Warcraft and since that I‚Äôve not found a game that I could sink my teeth into and invest time this game has everything I could ask for and I can play on my phone tablet and PC if I use An emulator. I‚Äôve been streaming this every day at the time of this post I had to have been playing for two weeks solid daily. I‚Äôve also been streaming it every day on Twitch the only thing I don‚Äôt like about the game up to this point is that I have to rely on certain guild events to get the stars to unlock the dragon mount. You essentially have a certain amount of time calculated within days and hours and you must complete that all the objectives within that time or you don‚Äôt get them out the three missions that I can‚Äôt do our guild related and my guild doesn‚Äôt seem to want to respond on running those types of missions to get them out so I understand some out being dungeon drop rate dropped and stuff like that but reliant on being a guild specific event I don‚Äôt agree with and that would be my only drawback to the gameOtherwise character creation and variety are plenty and there‚Äôs plenty of stuff to do in this game without buying a single thing.

However the game does have one detail about it that bothers me (no it‚Äôs not that half of the Dino‚Äôs should have feathers) it‚Äôs the scale. While you did a grand job on most of the scaling some of the dinosaurs either feel a bit too big (I.e velociraptor) or way too small (I.e Allosaurus). And granted I haven‚Äôt hunted them in a while (especially allosaurus) and you may have fixed the dinosaurs sizes it still really bothers me. Oh and before I‚Äôm done with this essay of a review I‚Äôd like to say one little thing... the spino and rex feel a few feet shorter than usual.And that‚Äôs it really, hope you guys see this and cya! (I should probably check myself right about now) Hey hunter! Thanks for gaming with us and for your suggestions! Don't forget to share your ideas in the comments under the Facebook note https://www.facebook.com/notes/carnivores/suggestions-at-carnivores-dinosaur-hunter-hd/2037873802930357/, so we will never lose it! I‚Äôve been playing Dinosaur Hunter for practically half of my life now‚Äî And I enjoy the idea of it quite well. However, I agree that this game should meet more standards; And be updated more often since it is the only mobile app from the Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter series. Being true that Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn has been a bigger work in progress, including the fact that its graphics are very well improved apart from this mobile version, and Reborn acquires more hunting perks; I feel like it‚Äôs although fair to switch your eyes to this app often, updating it regularly every 2-3 months. Okay‚Äî First things first‚Äî The recent reskinning on some of the dinosaurs, I have to point out that it made me upset. The other skins that came with the certain dinosaurs when they were released in the game were more original; But now it feels like the reskins gave them the common colors that varied through every dinosaur in the game. It‚Äôs not only that, but there SHOULD be more dinosaurs, more diverse wether they‚Äôre soaring in the sky or lurking in the ocean‚Äôs depths. Also, the graphics are fairly good‚Äî But can be improved with smoothing and extra key details. I‚Äôm not saying that you have to turn this completely into Reborn, but give this mobile game more thought. With more work, I believe this game is only a couple steps away from #1. First off I get why this game is 5 dollars but for 5 dollars you have to meet people expectations. When I bought this I expected a hunt but it was just a lock and load shoot Dino‚Äôs and leave. Add a better detection system. I believe you just added a radius that is the detection zone but I think you did it all around rather than on the peripherals. Maybe add a food and thirst bar that you fill up by eating mochops and dimetrodons. Make the Dino‚Äôs harder to find but still manageable. Herbivores also defend themselves so maybe you should make them dangerous from tail whips to headbutts. Increase each dinosaur size by 2.5x so it feels more realistic. I get that this is a alien planet but the proportions will seem the same next to the dinosaurs. Also make the guns better! Instead of just having the gun in your back pocket why not have it holstered in your hand. Lastly the best feature you can probably add is Dino‚Äôs that kill and eat each other for food! If a carnivore sees a herbivore it will attack and kill. Which ever one is the heaviest will win the fight. Also add pack hunting for velociraptor. Make the allosaurus look like a allosaurus. Also make it so carnivores fight for meals. And make flying bird hunts. "

Explore the cities and countryside of a vividly realized fictional version of the southwestern United States. You can tackle story-driven quests, gorge on fast food, outrun the police, or obey every traffic light‚Äîit‚Äôs up to you. This enormous game deftly displays Rockstar‚Äôs unique mastery of open-world design, and it never fails to entertain. Its a fantastic game, just like always. The controls are simple, but the storyline is complex, and great gameplay. Obviously, the graphics are top notch, but it makes up for it with storyline and gameplay. I love reading idiots who give it 1 star. No sound? probably because your device is horrendous. Bad controls? Check the settings. It honestly sounds like these people havent played a game in there life.Honestly, I cant complement this game enough. There are some missions that are hard, im looking at you, Wrong side of the tracks, but honestly, they are still fun. The side missions and things that you can do in San Andreas is epic. From getting haircuts, shopping for clothes, even being a paramedic! You can eat food and get fat, or work out and become strong. Or do both and become... Something. This game is one of the best, especially for mobile. I love this game, very fun, but there are a few glitches. The first one is on the robbery mission, sometimes when you get close to something CJ gets stuck on something and you can‚Äôt move which wakes up the person inside and then you get a 3 star wanted level. Another one is that the wrecking ball does not exist it is just a floating metal ball. Whenever I try to put a car in a garage it says you cannot store anymore vehicles in this garage even though my garage is completely empty and if I try to push my car in it will delete it. Another glitch I have experienced is that when I die during a gang war it gives the territory to me or it just removes it which I‚Äôm pretty sure is not supposed to happen. The last glitch happens on a date sometimes when you finish doing what she tells you to do instead of telling you to take her home, it doesn‚Äôt do that and when you do take her home you can‚Äôt drop her off, so you end up stuck with her and I have to restart the game. Also please put an option to disable tilt controls because I have to try to keep my iPad perfectly flat because if I don‚Äôt the car will pull to the other direction and it‚Äôs annoying. "

But I actually really enjoyed this game! Both Survivalcraft games were really neat. But why does the full version cost $3.99? I understand this was a demo to lead players into the game, but what if someone really enjoyed the demo, and wanted to see more? Well, they couldn‚Äôt, cause the full game is $3.99! Still though, it‚Äôs probably worth your money.Also, there are some aspects I think you could add into the game:- So far, the only supernatural monster is a werewolf. And while that‚Äôs pretty cool, I think the game could some more monsters, like skeletons or vampires, or something along that line.- Why are those sailors leaving you on the island for good? I didn‚Äôt quite understand that part. Honestly, I think it would be cool if there were more of a story behind that. (Like, maybe you committed a crime and then the sailors had to exile you on a far-off island)- Maybe you could add villages dotted around the island, so that there are others that you can trade with and interact with.These are a few of my ideas; but overall the game is fun. Keep it up Candy Rufus! Ok, so please read this whole thing before you download. This is only a demo version. The real Survivalcraft is loads better. However, the full version is $3.99.   Yes, this only lets you play for one day, but look at the title people. This is so people can get a taste of the game before paying $4 for it. Candy Rufus Games is doing you a favor. Giving you a free sample, just a taste, to see if you like it before spending money. And people complain that it's only one day. Yeah, the demo is not as fun. I agree. But the fun version costs money! I'm sick and tired of people calling Survivalcraft a ripoff of Minecraft. Survivalcraft has much much more stuff, and is more realistic, you can freeze to death or get sick or run out of energy. Minecraft is for building. Survivalcraft is for SURVIVING. The full version of this game is so much fun! hey since I played survival craft back in the old days, I really hated it because I hate minecraft rip-offs. but when I started playing this for free in ios, [I used tutuapp to download but it has limited days so ya] I also watched your vids. but then I realized, man, this is the greatest game! but one day, I had to verify the app alot. so when I verified it, it eon't really verify. so please, if you're reading this, I just hope you made a free and full version of survival craft 2. everytime it won't verify, I had to delete and install, and delete, and install and.. forever and ever till' 2019. so if you see this, please please make survival craft 3 free!!! because alot of people wanted to see alot! only some of us raged because we waste money sometimes.. just please do it!

A vertical climb game along the lines of ninjatown or doodle jump. With a unique art style, and great music this is easy to recommend. I personally found the controls easy to understand, and don't get where all the complaints come from... Half the screen is for jumping and the other half for grabbing, what's so hard about that?What I don't like about the game are the boost items that essentially = insta death. What's the point in punishing the player for picking up a 'special' item? If this one problem were fixed it would be a 5 star game. Oddy Smog's Misadventure is everything an excellent game should be. Simple to learn but difficult to master, the gameplay adds an original twist on the popular ""jumping"" genre. The prisoners add strategy to the game, forcing you to think quickly and go out of your way, though the score multiplier and ""wall jump"" are well worth it. The amazing graphics and music only make it that much more epic. The instant deaths after a jumping platform/rocket ship/teleporter are a little annoying, especially after you've made it a few thousand meters, but not enough for me to remove a star. An adventure mode would be pretty cool as well. Overall this is a fantastic app, and at $0.99 you have nothing to lose. You will not be disappointed. Good job overall, love the artwork and simple gameplay.  It's sucking my time to keep trying!  But pls, pls fix those annoying dead drop after the space ship ride or teleport.  If there is no gear directly above or below when you come out from the ship or the teleport machine, you are already dead with no choice.  Also would be great if have another stage or two with different background. "

It‚Äôs really fun, by I keep on not wanting to play because of the lack of selection of balls and roads. I know it says coming soon, but can u speed that up pls? It feels like sooooooo long! I think this is a rlly nice Nd creative sequel to the OG. I jus have a few suggestions: (1) I wish u could pick which music track to listen to, or I wish it would randomize cuz it gets repetitive listening to the same song over and over every time I open the app. (2) I suggest game modes to make it more interesting, with levels in in each game mode, or at least daily rewards or goals to keep you motivated to continue playing. (3) Ofc mor ball Nd trail options. But besides those things I think it‚Äôs a rlly good game. Thanks for your feedback!

That was a great choice because this app is great! It‚Äôs fast-paced, enjoyable, and fun! Every time I go into this app I know it‚Äôll be a great time-waster, it‚Äôs amazing for long car trips, waiting areas at the doctor, etc. But the best thing about it is that it gives you a CHOICE whether you want to watch an ad or not! Most other games just shove tons of ads in your face to make them more money, but this game actually cares about the game that they‚Äôre producing. My only complaint is that most of the player base seems.. fake? I just got into this game, but I‚Äôve gotten 1st place every time since I‚Äôve downloaded this.. So, I think there‚Äôs a big chance those are bots playing. Not a big complaint, but I think it‚Äôll introduce me to new players as I get better, sort of as a.. ‚Äúcradling‚Äù technique. To introduce me to the bots, then slowly trickle in real players. Overall a great app though! I love this game so much it‚Äôs so much fun and it‚Äôs fun combined with super fun I love skating so I can‚Äôt do it right now because of the corona virus ü¶† but I saw a add and I‚Äôm like wow I love skating so why not get this app and a asked my mom and she said yes and I played it and I fell in love with it it‚Äôs so fun and I‚Äôm speechless it‚Äôs such a fun game I love it and when I saw that you can Change ur character I was like what!!! I love this app I‚Äôm never gonna delete it thank you for making it all I do is play it I love this app so cool and fun my friends love this app to they played it and said you need to get this app and I  don‚Äôt have a phone and a couple days later my birthday üéÇ and my mom got me a phone and I saw the add I was like hey this is the app my friends were telling me about so my mo got it and that‚Äôs it I gotta water üöø the grass by love the game Honestly, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this game. Though, it could be better. 1. Speed. I think you should make this faster without having to spend coins. It would make the game much more fun. 2. The music. The only time music pops up is when a bonus game is up, or when you win. You should make music on all the levels so everyone can enjoy the amazing bonus level beats! 3. Equipping your car. I have no idea how to swap from a skateboard to roller skates quickly. Theirs no ‚Äúequip‚Äù or ‚Äúsave‚Äù button. Adding this can maybe get you a 5-Star review. 4. Ads. If you don‚Äôt have the Ad free version, the ads almost pop up every time something happens. It generally gets annoying. Maybe you could keep the ads, though make it go less? It would benefit the game greatly. 5. Color. Like I said about the ads, they pop up EVERYWHERE. You need to watch an ad before coloring your character. Like I said, developers should reduce the ads. That‚Äôs all I have to say about this game. Though, I do really LOVE this game, these are just some suggestions. Stay safe! "

I like how it‚Äôs not just another click/tap and actually engages the player but also allows you to still be doing other stuff while auto fight is on but don‚Äôt think you are safe just bc the AI is fighting for you because you will still have to shoot missiles down on your own. The fact that it also has a lot to do and a map to explore and plenty of cool enemy‚Äôs and allies is amazing. This game deserves a 5 out of 5 for being 1 of the few games on mobile that is actually amazing quality and not just a cash grab. I watch the ads (My own choice) to support them because I believe they made a amazing mobile game. So far I‚Äôve been playing for 2-3 days and I haven‚Äôt felt forced to do anything through my play through but I feel like they do hold your hand a little bit during the first couple of minutes but that‚Äôs fine and understandable and no where near as bad as other game tutorials. Overall please support this app to show that good mobile games are possible and don‚Äôt need to be cash grab garbage ad filled games to do well. This game is so fun. It‚Äôs very addicting and the perfect game to play when your feeling a little lazy. Maybe you just wanna relax, this is the game to hop on. To me, it‚Äôs super satisfying to watch, and it‚Äôs not difficult at all so it doesn‚Äôt get annoying. At least not too annoying. There is one problem with the game and it‚Äôs the fact that it gives you ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù hints. For instance, if you‚Äôre holding a ton of apples, the game reminds you can camp and cook em for upgrades. This sounds quite useful, until you find out the game won‚Äôt give you a break. I was debating on whether I should rate the game 4 or 5 stars and I went for 5 cause it‚Äôs a good game, but these tips make it annoying and unfortunately, sometimes unplayable. At the moment, I haven‚Äôt even been able to play because my pilot is max level so QUITE LITERALLY every five seconds, it reminds me to upgrade him and I can‚Äôt cause I don‚Äôt have enough gems at the moment, but it doesn‚Äôt stop telling me to upgrade him. Maybe their is a way to get rid of the tips that I‚Äôm unaware of but it gets quite aggravating. All in all though, this game is fun. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm part of a few people who have had a lot of trouble with the tips, so I don‚Äôt know if anyone else is having trouble with em, but it‚Äôs still very fun and relaxing. If you like bizarre tortoise games this is for you. Lol! This game is overall very good. Very balanced and doesn‚Äôt require you to buy currency to get ahead. As they said in the overview, it is very challenged and is very engaging. You definitely need to be paying attention, as the difficulty increases quickly. I love the map feature. Capturing unique bases that give you bonus rewards over time is a great idea. I normally don‚Äôt see things like this in games. One thing I dislike is how weak the raid bosses are. It says that they take multiply generation‚Äôs to beat but I can usually take them out as long as I activate my Pilot and Hero abilities. Speaking of Pilots and Heroes, this is another great feature. They are not overpriced, each are very unique and give you great bonuses. The Mutation and Evolutions system is something you see in many games but it‚Äôs still great to see it in this one. Loving the game and I would like to see more updates. "

It got worse the longer you played the game. I‚Äôm currently on an iPad Air 2 running the latest iOS as of writing this review. There‚Äôs also a few texture bugs where sometimes things would turn into weird gray squares, but they're nothing game breaking. Gun controls could be better as well, but they‚Äôre enjoyable for the most part. The game gets a bit repetitive the more you play it too. But besides all that, it‚Äôs a solid and fun game. Interesting story and characters, nice soundtrack (although there‚Äôs only 4-5 songs per station), decent graphics for a mobile game, fun gameplay, and plenty of things to do besides missions. Be warned, though. The game has definitely showed it‚Äôs age. Overall a solid purchase and I‚Äôm happy. I just finished the main story and got everything I wanted to do done. Go ahead and buy it! I think it‚Äôs worth it. So I have been playing the game for 3 hours on and off and I noticed a couple of things you can't do. You can't do drive-by shooting and you can't aim wherever you want when shooting people. It was kind of a let down even though those are minor flaws. I'd love to see a update in the future where these two things might be addressed. Other than that, the game is amazing. Oh and it'd be neat if there was a way to enter codes to access all weapons, armor and to be able to drive the tank. Update: if you could make this game full screen and fix the bugs that are making it freeze up that would be great. I noticed GTA Vice City got an update and it looks way better in full screen for iPhone XS Max There once was an awesome review I spent probably 30 mins typing. Then I hit cancel instead of send. *palm to the forehead* ...almost drops phone and swipes on screen nearly deleting this.. #epicfail         This game is a classic piece of moving art.

Now that that‚Äôs done, normally have a relatively short attention span for any game, mobile or pc, but for some reason, this has held it. When the ads say constant updates, they mean it. Two heroes a month come out with constant events. Many times in mobile games there is stamina or lives to stop you from playing much at once. Hero hunters does have this, but since there are so many events and missions and pvp options it barely becomes a problem. That also stopped me from playing for hours on end. Which in turn stopped me from getting bored because on the game. To give an example on some games I will play 30-40 games and immediately get extremely bored. This game does have micro transactions which they are constantly pushing which can get annoying at points, but everything that you buy will permanently help you in some way. For example, if you buy gold and get some crafting materials, yes you will use them, and they are not infinite, but when you use them to upgrade a hero, it won‚Äôt become obsolete as heroes of every level are needed to progress (Gauntlet missions scale in difficulty, so even low level heroes help out a ton). Now this game isn‚Äôt perfect, but it is currently my favorite game and I highly recommend it. Let me just start by saying yes I am a real person and this is a genuine review. I started playing HH around the time it first dropped on mobile, and honestly there isn‚Äôt a single mobile game that I‚Äôve played that has kept me interested and engaged as long as this one! For starters, the game is super easy to pick up. It‚Äôs not difficult at all and there are plenty of heroes to unlock and upgrade so it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôll blow through in a short amount of time. There are multiple types of in game currency, as well as ‚Äúgold‚Äù which you can use to purchase crates that allow you to unlock characters a bit early. I know a lot of people see that and think ‚Äúmoney hungry‚Äù, but there honestly is no need to spend money on this game as they give you so many opportunities to earn the currency through participating in events! Something I‚Äôve never seen other devs do! This game has an energy system which early on really limited how much time you spent on the game, but now the devs have added several new game modes that don‚Äôt require it as well as daily quests and opportunities to earn more! All in all I recommend if you‚Äôre in to rpg shooters as this is probably my favorite mobile game of all time! 10/10 would recommend This is truly an amazing game I started playing I believe when it first came out got obsessed created my own alliance Alaska907 got my brother obsessed with it he joined my alliance and a couple of friends as well. It keeps me engaged and interested, longer than any game I‚Äôve ever played on mobile. There are of course a couple things I would change such as the alliance store it takes sooooo long to restock and they have a lot of the same things in there constantly. I‚Äôve been saving up alliance fragments to buy new hero fragments but it‚Äôs the same people over and over and I need new heroes. Also they start new god hero‚Äôs out at such a low star that after the events are over you toss the hero aside and don‚Äôt pay much attention to them because without them being at LEAST a 5 star they are useless. A couple of other minor things but for the most part those are my biggest concerns. Thanks hero hunters! :)Update...Of course I‚Äôm still playing and I still love this game! One thing I would love to see added in the next update would be a max hero skill button, I know it sounds like I‚Äôm to lazy to his a button 79 times to upgrade but it would save time to just hit one.

The leveling is hard enough to get you an amazing feel of challenge but at the same time not give you a sense of frustration. This game is what most other games fail to accomplish: a perfect balance. The hidden weapons and trinkets are hard enough to take you some time to find them but not placed in an impossible place. I only ever had to look up at ONE hidden trinket. I chose a balanced set for my skills. Meaning that I wasn‚Äôt putting ALL or most of my skill points on attack or health. Even with that I still was progressing normally and with a healthy amount of difficulty. All of the bosses had fair attacks and phases to the point that if you died it was more of bad planning on your part than bad/faulty programming. The best part of this game though, is that it never forces you to continue on the main storyline. You always have the option to spend hours leveling up or looking for hidden stuff as you try to 100% the game. All of that makes for one hell of a game for traveling or waiting for a class to start, as you will be spending hours piecing together the lore, or just leveling up until you are one-hit killing bosses. Definitely a must have game on any phone! I hate writing reviews but I‚Äôm so impressed with this release that I feel it‚Äôs my duty as an avid gamer to do so.....sooooo here it goes-if the castlevania/Metroid genre ( admittedly more the first than the latter) had a baby with a fine tuned rpg,then ud have this game.  Everything-literally,graphics,gameplay,story,overall execution,etc are done near flawlessly, 5 star all the way, if u,like myself have wished for a castlevania release on IOS,well then like myself ur gonna have to keep on waiting......BUT if ur down with the next best and in some respects better thing then GET THIS GAME....u will not regret itPost edit:had the game for a few days now and all I can say over and over and over is WOW just simply WOW....I from the bottoms of my heart wish u guys win some kind of game of the year award....it would take me multiples of multiples of paragraphs to do this game justice......This game is 100% worth double the asking price.....and this last bit is real talk-just to the devs: PLEASE keep making games,please,Grimvalor is an example of everything IOS gaming can and should b,u kno what I‚Äôm talking about and from one fan of tru gaming to a a group of who I can only assume is made up of the same-congrats-this game will go down as one of the best on this platform First let me start by saying that the 2D and 2.5D Castlevania games are my favorite games and have been for over 25 years!  With that being said, this is not a Castlevania game, but it in the same style of a Castlevania game, closest I‚Äôve seen yet on IOS.  The graphics are great, the sound experience and music fits the game really well, and the controls, once you get used to them, actually work rather well.  It took me a little to master (or try to master) the controls, especially some of the special moves, but lots of practice and I actually like the control system.  Of course, I‚Äôd rather play with a controller and always will prefer a controller.  The gameplay is fun, challenging yet not too difficult as in the early Castlevania games, the save points are strategically placed, and I really enjoyed the story!  One of the best action platformers with RPG elements that I‚Äôve played on IOS and I‚Äôve been playing IOS games for over 8 years now.  I look forward to this company‚Äôs next game, and would ask for some possible DLC such as new levels/areas and perhaps stronger weapons.  Excellent game for the money, highly recommend!

So. Much. Puke. The controls in this bizarrely clever platformer are spot on, but sometimes we‚Äôre giggling so hard at our barf-propelled hero that we slip up and die laughing. It truly is an Eggggg-cellent adventure. I like how the game gives the player plenty of chances to increase their jump accuracy skills with plenty of gradually increasing challenges.The game doesn't dump the player immediately into any""one mistake and you die"" situations. But those challenges must eventually be faced to make progress.If I were to change anything, I'd make the first level much, much longer, with each challenge just a tiny bit harder than the last. Every so often there would be a sign that says ""If you got this far, you've got the minimum skill for Level X."" With 'X' being  the level number that a warp portal next to the sign would take you to.The first level would be full of lots and lots of randomly generated background visuals and sound effects so the player doesn't get bored as they get enough practice to proceed to new levels. This will also ensure that easily frustrated players with lower skill levels will not give up too soon, while easily bored players with higher skills can skip on to the level that challenges them.It's a win-win for players of all types. Game designs shouldn't be completely linear. Such a structure forces the players to spend excessive amounts of time being stuck playing the one part of the game they are not good at and probably won't enjoy. The game structure should automatically route different players to the different types of challenges that they find most enjoyable. The game is wonderful! Awesome graphics enjoyable concept, levels, and artwork. The obstacles and treasures are really fun!Here's the HUGE UPSET, I can't remember what I paid ($3 or $4), but the game is tooo short, i felt like I plaid a ""Free Lite"" Version of this game. I didn't notice in the games description until now that I chose to review the app, but the game only has 21 levels, of which the first 10 are very short training levels. The last ten bonus levels (which are after fighting the final boss) are the fun and exciting levels with high anxiety obstacles that I enjoyed. Non the less, I completed the game within about 2 hours (including secrets and treasures) and felt really ripped off after paying about $4. Save your money, watch some gameplay walk through videos and you'll see what I mean. The levels only take about 1-2 minutes to complete, the final harder levels take about 6-12 minutes each your first time playing through them. After completing the game there's nothing extra left to do (unless you pay $3 more for 15 more levels) but to delete the app from your phone.I honestly was expecting many many more levels for a premium priced ios game like this.

Playing through the levels over and over is fun. Plenty of variety since there are ten levels with varied Bots to fight and weapons to dodge. Roll, jump, or take cover. You can customize your own Bot with upgrades. Seriously great game for the low price. When you play this game for the first time, all difficulties besides ""Easy"" are locked.  On ""Easy,"" almost every level in this game is a cakewalk, with the exception of the actually-somewhat-challenging final boss. Then, when you beat the game, all the other difficulties are unlocked.  Now, you can play the exact same levels you just breezed through, except presumably harder.  I say ""presumably,"" because after a d*** move like that, I'm not touching this again.The sad part is that there are still a lot of collectible in-game logs to find on higher difficulties, and they're actually entertaining to read.  But they're not worth playing the game itself.  In retrospect, maybe the developers should have asked themselves whether, out of all the game mechanics the App Store sorely lacks, ""cover shooting"" was the one that desperately needed to be adapted. I‚Äôve played this on my old phone when the game first came out. I played it for ages and now I‚Äôm playing it again on a new phone. One thing I‚Äôve noticed comparing the older version of the game is the lighting. In the old version, I could actually see what was going on on the screen, and in the scrapyard I could see what my robot looks like with different equippment. The new version of the game changed the lighting so much that everything is unnecessarily bright, there‚Äôs so much white on the robot, and it doesn‚Äôt look cool anymore when I put on different equippment. I wish there was an option to change the lighting effect. "

That is how games have always been and this whole in-game purchase crap started with mobile apps. I have no issues spending money to buy a well made game but I won‚Äôt pay to play or pay to win. Thank you to the developers for porting over Titan Quest to iOS unmolested. Too bad they couldn‚Äôt of brought over the multiplayer feature as well. Great game, love it. Titan Quest has a special place in my heart. I started to play back when it was first released on PC in 2006. The unique setting, intricate class creation and amazing game flow still remain exciting to this day and I am thankful for developers that know that there are still fans of the classics out here.The mobile version is well ported in my opinion and I have not had any major issues. The targeting can be tricky so any characters that require specific aim may sometimes be frustrating to play, other than that it is amazing to play on phone and seriously one of the best values on the AppStore for this price. I give 4 stars only because there are some features that need to be updated that already exist on other platforms such as having a Storage vendor to store items, bigger inventory space, a button to sort items and other small QOL features. Also PLEASE bring the DLCs soon! üòä I ignored the other reviews saying it crashes and downloaded it anyway (because I love the game). The game constantly crashes, and is unplayable. Don‚Äôt be like me. It‚Äôs a great game, but this developer needs to fix this issue ASAP.Edit!!!!The Devs fixed the crashing issues (mostly) and the game is definitely playable. They also fixed Typhon so he uses his skills, instead of merely being a loot pi√±ata (which is kind of a bummer, but actually a good thing). If they opened up the ability to transfer items from character to character and perhaps added in the expansions, I‚Äôd increase my rating to ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.

Earning gold on each challenge is a Herculean task, but whether you‚Äôre racing, flying, or careening off jumps, this incredible follow-up will keep you engrossed and entertained. Well, the camera is broken. The game is completely unplayable because of this one problem. There is not a single way around it. I read the other reviews and this is not a problem strictly on my device. Please fix this problem!! I miss playing this game so please fix it. If it were not unplayable it would be a 5 star app. First, for those having steering issues, simply flip your device 180 degrees, wait for the game to flip, then flip the device back.Overall, I absolutely love this game. I have had it for many years and appreciate the fact that the developers have not ruined it with adds (as many are these days). The gameplay is simple, but never gets old. The expansion packs are well worth the money, though I do wish more would be created. "

I totally forgot about this game though until today. i was looking at the app store searching for ‚Äúshooter games‚Äù. I came across this and got a huge hit or nostalgia. It brought me back to awesome memories. I‚Äôve just got a couple problems. For starters, the graphics. Now everyone is complaining about the graphics and i agree with them. Not saying the game is bad at ALL. All i‚Äôm saying is i‚Äôd prefer better graphics. I think if you guys put some more effort into it you‚Äôd get pretty good graphics. Second, updates. I looked on the history and all of it was 7 years ago except for one. And that one was the last update there was. 2 years ago! This game hasn‚Äôt been worked on for a whole 2 years!!! My goodness. All my suggestion is that: lots of people still play this game. Creators, please be more consistent with this game. I‚Äôm not sure if the creators are working on other games now and have moved on or not cuz i haven‚Äôt caught up on their work. But these are all suggestions and random thoughts. Right before this review i started to re download the game and i‚Äôm ready to start gaming on this like the old days! Thanks! This game is surprisingly good. The graphics could be better, but the gameplay definitely makes up for it. The gameplay is really smooth, and that‚Äôs not very common in Mobile Shooters. I love that this game has customizable classes and all that jazz, it kinda makes it feel like you‚Äôre playing a console game. The AI is actually very intelligent and difficult to beat which makes single player challenging.There is only one complaint I have and that is the lack of content. This game should be a top priority for the developers, because this game is good. Very good. And it has room for even more goodness. I personally would love a built in friends list, like Clash of Clans. Also Custom Games would be cool, where you can play with other people and bots and set the time limit and score limit and difficultly of the bots. More gamemodes would be really cool, too. There is only four as if now in the game, and there would be many new game possibilities with extra game modes. There‚Äôs no shame in just adding Call of Duty gamemodes like Search and Destroy, Gun Game, Ground War, or Team CTF. It‚Äôs a mobile game, y‚Äôknow? Overall this game is fantastic I just really hope they add more content soon and even start updating the game regularly. This is one of the most pathetic cash grabs I've ever played.Now, ignoring the awful aiming and movement, this game is ACTIVELY TRYING TO SABOTAGE YOU. The AI is completely retarded if their your teammates but the enemy can instantly pinpoint your location and can do coordinated attacks while your team takes 15 seconds to figure out that they die if you shoot them. There is a semi cap the flag mode where you have to pick up a goat and carry it to get points. You are only aloud to use your pistol so your pretty much defenseless. This is important because your team will stand back casually as it turns into a 4v1 where the one has only a pistol. Luckily that won't happen because your team will always get to the goat first due to the fact that you will ALWAYS be targeted by the enemy even if your behind the entire rest of your team and also the goat will constantly run from the player. Not even your team but YOU specifically. Speaking of running away from you, if your team has the goat they will actively evade their teammates and run into the most open area, whereas the enemy team will hunker down in a crevice and their teammates will bodyguard them. You also can't look up or down and if you stop playing for like a month the game WILL RESET ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS. "

It's a shame because they've made some really great hits (stick warriors being the top), and a multiplayer format for some of these games would really go a long way for the company.Anyway, fun update, solid game as always. :) I tried the classic mode. It is similar to Cartoon Wars but not as good. The strategy is so simple. You just try to defend your tower while waiting for your tropes to age until the $10,000 super robot available. You then can send the robot to the other side to destroy the other tower. To defend your own tower, you just try to upgrade the tower weapons and increase height to accommodate more weapons. Use the power up to kill all the opponents at once. You should try to avoid using the power up too much because it will draw power and slow your aging. Use the power up when the screen is filled with many opponents. You just use the cheapest $100 guys to defend your tower. You just keep at least 2 guys before your tower to avoid damage to your own tower. When you are on offensive, you can sell your tower weapons to get more money for two super robots and you will win. There are so many things wrong with this game. 1. When in the medieval age there is a spot right in front of the enemy‚Äôs tower where the turrets can‚Äôt hit you 2. $6 for generals?? It makes no sense why to get a general and it doesn‚Äôt change the game whatsoever 3. The easy mode is waaaaay too easy and the normal mode is waaaaay too hard 4. The AI are so incredibly annoying 5. The AI know when you have no gold to produce units so they use the special ability and obliterate your entire army 6. It‚Äôs worse than the computer version, and that‚Äôs hard to beat, good job game devs for being retarded 7. It makes me want to throw my phone across the room and shatter it with a sledgehammer because of how annoying the game is 8.

I can actually progress which makes it more fun that you have to progress to get to different shops, and things like that. I will give this game a 4- Star rating just because its a little bit too hard to get far with only standard things, such as rockets, umbrellas, spring board, etc. But if you developers can change or fix progression at the very least, i will give it a 5 star rating. Good Dayüòã So the game is pretty good for the most part, but like all games can't be perfect, however, that's not what docs the stars. At first I thought it was my phone, but after I reset it, I quickly realized it wasn't. The homepage goes ""numb"" where I can't click anything. It was working fine the other times I used it, but now it's kinda, stuck. I also logged into Facebook, and it's kinda annoying that whenever I open the app, it's pops up with the ""Can this app allow access to Facebook"" blah blah blah. So I also know the sensors in my phone aren't dead because I can click that button ""allow"" just fine, but when I try to start the game, the screen won't do anything. If you can make an update to fix these little bugs, then I think it has potential to reach a five star rating. Thank you! This is a great game! Now when I don't have my laptop with me I can still play Learn to Fly! As my review is titled, the app is nearly not as good as the Flash version on Kongregate, but since Flash will no longer be updated starting next year, this is definitely a viable alternative to crappy imitations if something goes wrong with your Flash program.Having said that, it is an entirely different game from the Flash version. The graphic style is not as simple, and therefore not as fun. The simplicity of the Flash game is gone. The humor of the Flash game is replaced by an inferior, boring humor. The Bonus Shop/Black Market is gone. If you liked the original three Flash games (not counting LTF Idle) for what they were as much as what they weren't, you will be disappointed by this game. "

Its randomized levels and treacherous traps keep the action fresh, and with meaningful hero upgrades, we always have something to strive for. The awesome retro visuals and wonderfully simple controls are just what we‚Äôd expect from the wizards at Nitrome. Just a little idea for a green ninja frog character. The character costs 10,000, and it has 5 upgrade stars. When you buy him, he starts off with the ability frog skin. Frog skin absorbs slimes. When you buy the next upgrade, which is 1,500, the ability is upgraded so that after you absorb 4 slimes, you will be saved from jumping off the edge once, then you need more slimes. The animation for the save is the same for when slime blocks don't let you jump in the game green ninja. The next upgrade is 2000, and its a charge ability, that takes 10 seconds to recharge, and with it, you chop the block in front of you, breaking any trap, and killing enemies. The next upgrade, if you let your ability charge for 30 seconds instead of ten, you launch forward, and kill any trap or enemy you end up hitting. The only way to stop going forward, is to hit something, or the slime saves you, or you die. The last upgrade is called ninja instinct, where you are unable to be effected by the green, gold, and purple wisps, and any arrow from a crossbow that comes at you, is reflected with a chop. I really hope you use this idea. You can tinker with it all you want, but I just really hope you use it. Thanks for reading this. I hope that I can see the green ninja character sometime soon! :D I am a fan of games with pixel style so when I figured out about nitrome I was pretty excited. I‚Äôve played nearly all of the games. When I originally got this one I thought it was fun but not anything amazing. I played it for a little while and eventually unlocked a few other characters. This is when I realized how cool this game was. All of the different characters had quite unique abilities. When you get bored instead of just closing the app and doing a different game you can pick another person who will completely change your experience. I like how all of the characters when maxed out are almost about equal in strength. I have spent hours grinding on this game just to upgrade a few characters. I hope that they add some other people to play as soon though because everyone who plays this game will eventually run out of things to upgrade. At first it‚Äôs really satisfying, but it gets old pretty quickly. Overall this is easily a five star game and a really great experience. "

I had to play on the developers time when they wanted me to; now I can play on my time when I feel like it.The game has a lot of the little issues from the original like the feeling that the true enemy of the game is its auto targeting system that I often wish there was a way to let me quickly override in game. Otherwise its got the same great twin stick action and short missions with challenging objectives.This version does have some features removed present in the IAP version such as multiplayer which I remember was a really enjoyable game mode for me. I can't really fathom why that with be removed in this version but it really is a bummer not to have it.Theres a lot of potential in future updates to add things like co-op, multiplayer, a rogue like Risk of Rain style game mode or a boss rush mode. Even custom community made missions would be a great way to add endless content and value to players. I'm glad the developers went this route with the monetization and I really enjoyed how much I've played so far and I am looking forward to finishing and 3 staring every mission, ideally with a friend in co-op, but even the single player is a lot of fun. Gameplay is great. Now that it‚Äôs not free to play the money system seems to be broken though. You end up with so much extra gold with nothing to spend it on. Also every star challenge involves the same handful of guns for some reason. The game is enjoyable for the first few hours, but gets repetitive later on. I was excited when I began playing - tons of weapons, gear, and abilities to unlock - but as I progressed, the game‚Äôs shortcomings began to present themselves. You‚Äôll unlock everything around level 40 and then you‚Äôll be trapped in a cycle of monotony for the latter half of the game. Upgrades don‚Äôt feel rewarding, levels are copied and pasted with only minor tweaks, and the shooting mechanics are lackluster. Your gun aims itself, stripping the player of any sense of agency. Also the in game currency is handed out like candy, rendering it almost useless because you never have to decide what to spend it on. Want that upgrade? Buy it. Want this upgrade? But it. There‚Äôs no need to manage your resources sense they flow like water. Again, let me say, I enjoyed this game for a few hours, but by the end it felt quite empty, unrewarding, and tedious. Three stars for a solid two hours of content and no in app purchases, but nothing ground breaking here. "

I‚Äôve been playing this game for the longest and fell in love with it, but whenever the new updates came there were lots of problems which you can hear in other comments. Please consider fixing these and BRING BACK THE CLASSIC. I love this game don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I really liked the old SM better. I didn‚Äôt used to be a pay to win game. It was fun and was a real strategy game, and you didn‚Äôt have to pay just to get good Items out of boxes. Also PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HACKERS. And even though they give a toxic energy pay attention to the bad reviews in order to make the game better. I personally think that the old versions of SM were better and had a better game experience. I‚Äôm talking about the versions that had more loot boxes or even the store. Back when it wasn‚Äôt pay to win and when loot boxes were better and had a better chance of giving the types of Items they were supposed to. I really liked the old SM and would greatly appreciate it if you would consider this. Thank you This has been one of my favorite games over the years. It is just so much fun whether it‚Äôs PVP or the campaign. One of the best things about this game is that it doesn‚Äôt spit an Ad into your face every 30 seconds. You have a choice to watch an Ad to get certain rewards though. While it may be pay to win, you still have to grind. Also, maybe adding some sort of base similar to Clash of Clans that you defend from Mechs would be cool. That would be awesome, just a recommendation for a major update. Also another benefit of this game is that you can play on pc and mobile too. Thanks devs, I really like the Clash of Clans type games so it would be cool if you added more things to your base and made it similar to CoC because right now the base is kinda boring to see and it needs an overhaul.

So if you want to survive as an intergalactic pilot, you‚Äôll need to think fast. Thankfully, dodging and weaving through Hyperburner‚Äôs gorgeous levels is pure exhilaration. We love how beating stages ‚Äúrewards‚Äù us with faster ships‚Äîit means the better we get, the harder the game gets. I thought this game was fantastic. While the experience was somewhat short (it took me less than a week to complete every stage,) each stage was exhilarating and jam-packed with fun. Only at a couple instances did it feel unfair/copy-pasted, and the difficulty curve is otherwise well-crafted. The controls are excellent, as is the aesthetic of the game. The cell-shaded, futuristic visuals made the game optically interesting while I whizzed by obstacles. It seems like some users experienced lag, but I did not on my iPod 6. In terms of dollars to hours, this game provided me over 3 times my money's worth. The extra challenges from the achievements do seem extraordinarily difficult, and perhaps I will never complete them (I currently have an achievement completion rate of 65%.) Regardless, the original levels are fantastic, and I think everyone interested in this type of game should play Hyperburner. While the graphics are amazing to look at, the mechanics are an issue. Even in some of the early stages, you must make split-second calculations in order to dodge the oncoming obstacles; level five of the first world in particular. Towards the end of this level you have less than a second to maneuver your craft into a hole barely big enough for it. Not to mention the rapidly shifting camera angles. The camera constantly rotates and, due to the quick finger movements required, rapidly zooms around, as well.The biggest issue I found, and the one that inspired the title of this review, is the hit box. If you are within what I'd say is a virtual foot, your ship will blow up. Clipped a pixel of ship's wing? Boom. Flew by too fast? Boom.In the end, it's a good game with flawed mechanics, like many other games. Don't just take my word for this, though. Take it as a suggestion, but try the game yourself. Who knows? You might find it amazing regardless of the issues. You might not even see any issues! Anyways, have fun and happy spacefaring! "

Please ignore the whining reviews. If you decide to pay real money for a iphone game then you deserve everything that comes to you in the game. The developers have developed the game to make money. What else do you expect?? Its up to you to be responsible and realize that this is the motive and its up to you to have enough discipline to not spend thousands of dollars on a game! No one should have to explain this to anyone. The game is addicting and has held my attention for a pretty long time which is impressive seeing as I am the type that is quick to delete games. The only thing I hate is the wait time but I suppose that its actually good because if I can see myself playing this non stop and probably not getting as much done in real life. If you are a competitive and calculating being such as myself then you should enjoy the game. When I first got this game, I was thinking of being bombarded with ads, since previous games I‚Äôve played that are free. Include tons of ads during gameplay, but not this one thankfully! You can view ads to speed up (upgrades, more rewards, etc). At the start of the game, it was a bit tricky to understand the sicario‚Äôs, because I didn‚Äôt know how to place them on my camp. Thankfully, I ended up understanding more down the road. When you join a cartel, I was informed on much more about the game and certain strategies/tricks to learn on attacking & defense. I‚Äôm now a level 30 and still approve of this game being one of my favorites.Pros‚Ä¢Addicting to you‚Äôre not waiting for 5 hours off the app to wait for something exciting to happen.‚Ä¢In-App Purchases are definitely worth it since they give bonuses on top of what you buy. Rather than this is what you get at a flat purchase‚Ä¢Offers many ways of collecting more loot with ads /& speeding up upgrades, training camps, and etc. Cons‚Ä¢When other users attack your base. It seems game allows them to take too much and ends up taking slightly longer time to recoup losses. ‚Ä¢Match-Making has periods where it assigns you to people that you can‚Äôt attack because of there defenses compared to your current on hand offenses & the levels they‚Äôre at. Other than that, a decent game to burn time and binge on! Keep it up! Its very good game and cartel atmospheric gameplay make it better...But your team have to improve it :1.fix bugs , like ads : when I want to see ads to skip waiting for 20mins the game will be closed automatically ,,, chats menu doesn't work 2.make the game unique not boom beach2 by adding more things that player can do as a drugs cartel like deal scenes with man to man fire fight ( some thing like warships in boom beach as a real time fight)not man to defensive building fights And more unique gameplay objects like escape from police in a hot pursuit or fight with police, not other cartels because police is most dangerous enemy for drug cartels ,,, or add some mini games to gameplay to make game special ‚ù§Ô∏è "

The UI is great, everything is very responsive and the computers are not dumb whatsoever. However, I have two issues about this game that kept me from giving it 5 stars. First, every once in a while the game won't load after showing the headphone screen. I have found that a temporary fix is to keep reloading the game. You have to let Gamecenter show its notification as the headphone screen comes up otherwise just restart the game and try again. Second, which is the worst, the game has a tendency to throw your camera across the map when you just want to move a bit and it can be very frustrating when you have enemies attacking a system and you can't respond because your camera is being put on the edge of the map every time you scroll. This problem is random but can make the game completely unplayable for me. I hope you can fix these problems soon because this is a great game. Okay- hear me out. I love strategy games! Especially challenging ones. I keep finding myself coming back to this game. I just love how simple yet genius it is! To top it off the multiplayer is and amazing feature that you should take advantage of. Highly recommend it! If you find out that it‚Äôs buggy just uninstall it and reinstall. "

And I have a lot of games. For starters it‚Äôs really easy to get free mode. And I love free mode because you could do what ever you want on it. And the levels are also really fun to. Mostly because you have a specific objective and you get to look around this whole entire city and bump into things and knock things over and look for what you need. Overall Dino simulator is by far one of most fun games out there and you will be missing out if you don‚Äôt get it. The game is fun when you‚Äôre not being interrupted by a stupid ad right IN THE MIDDLE OF GAME PLAY! I can understand having ads AFTER a round. That would make sense, but WHILE you‚Äôre playing the game? That‚Äôs just stupid and annoying! Plus, there are too many! The interruptions mess you up and the game starts playing again before the ad close button pops up, so you lose valuable time and/or you continue to take damage from the enemy. The dinosaur is a little hard to maneuver but I can deal with that. It‚Äôs just an added challenge. However, it would be nice to be able to choose what side you want the controller on, especially if you‚Äôre right handed.Oh, and at one point, when you first start playing the game, it tries to extort a 5 star review out of you before it will let you play one of the modes. Come on... you want a five star review? Come by it honestly and fix the above issues. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll give it a 5 star review.

Right before a match, an ad comes, after the match, an ad comes on. Even when I see an ad to get a free chest, right after that ad there‚Äôs another ad and not only that. Most of the time when I press x on an ad, the games takes away my ability to hear the tank move and shoot. And sometimes when I play pvp, if I win a match and then go into another match, the game automatically destroys my tank. And if anyone else didn‚Äôt notice already, when you take damage in pvp you take way more damage then you do when you play against a bot. I mean they could‚Äôve upgraded their tank but even kids with the starter tank like to troll other ppl and that just makes this game frustrating and unfair. I like to play this game when I am most of the time mad, so I like to take my anger on other ppls tanks but most of the time, ppl with frost or Abrams take away 3/4 of my health with one missle. The only thing keeping me from giving this game a 5 star rating is that there is such a big amount of ads. Oh yea, another thing. Id like how the bots sometimes hide behind a hill and move up so close to me that they hurt themselves by shooting at me like that‚Äôs how close they get. Id stands for I don‚Äôt btw I‚Äôve enjoyed this game but there‚Äôs a few problems that really keep me from giving this game four starsMy first complaint is the frost tank and it‚Äôs stupid frostbite move, I‚Äôm tired of going into multiplayer matches and losing to someone who thinks they‚Äôre good because they use the tank I like the move needs to be nerfed heavilyMy seconds complaint would be something to do with multiplayer as well, whenever you quit a match before it ends and you go into a new match there‚Äôs an issue where I‚Äôll die instantly, if this was intentional to reduce rage quitting then I respect the motive but not the outcomeMy third complaint has to do with the ads, I understand that since this game is free then ads are just guaranteed but good god is there a bunch, of you win a match, there‚Äôs an ad, if you lose a match you get an ad, if I want to unlock the chest I win after just watching an ad then I have to watch an ad and sometimes my screen will freeze to black from the ad and then I have to close the app and lose my reward from the game I just played, I feel like instead of after a match ends you should let us watch the ad to get the chest but still have the option to skip the reward if we don‚Äôt feel like watching the ad or if we can‚Äôt gain the reward due to being onlineI really wish I could give this game a five star but these three factors keep me from giving it five stars but other than these the game‚Äôs been extremely enjoyable. Update: GLITCHES GLITCHES AND MORE GLITCHES. I never win a reward after a match because it goes to a black screen which forces me to close to app. So no reward is ever given when I do that after I win a match. Most problems just need updates but will be deleting this and never looking back if they don‚Äôt fix it soon. It‚Äôs been going on for too long.  When this app is open my new iPhone XS Max gets very hot and eats up my battery more than any other game or app I have ever used. There may just need an update but it‚Äôs pretty bad and has been like this since I downloaded the game a few days ago. Other than that it would be a 5 star game if they did not force you to watch a video after every game. We already, willingly, press to play videos for (because we have to) to open the ‚Äúfree chests‚Äù to get upgrades. I just think we watch enough videos even without being forced to watch them after each and every game. AND for some reason these advertisement videos are longer when relating to how other game apps are. This games advertisements are usually around 30seconds each. That‚Äôs a long time! We get the point in 15seconds so these could be cut in half so we could at least watch 2 different 15 second videos that way this app can make more money playing more advertisement videos. After 15seconds it just gets annoying and even if I think the game looks cool that they are advertising I won‚Äôt download it because of how obnoxiously long their trailer is. Hi there! Thank you for feedback. Your review will be passed to the developers and they'll see what changes could be made to improve the game. If you have any further concerns, don't hesitate to let us know.

They turned out to be too big after the system update and takes up to half of the screen. Hope this could be fixed soon. 1. The Bluetooth multiplayer won't connect. All DoTEMU SNK games with ""Bluetooth multiplayer feature"" do not work.... And they do not update or fix this problem.2. The Achievement, the one which you should get after playing with all of the characters... Is broken. I've played with all of the characters but I still haven't gotten it. 3. The controls is problematic and pathetic  at times, and it's unfair that certain characters' SP moves are very few in comparison to others. I honestly believe that SNK should find another company who will port their classic arcade games on the iOS or on other mobile platforms because DotEMU is not reliable. A couple of good things that I can say about this game is that it's my favorite KOF game and that you can really adjust the difficulty (like make it easy) unlike KOF97 and Samurai Shodown II (which I will not recommend anyone to buy because it's unenjoyable to play). I was not expecting to like the touch controls as much as I did. This is the first fighting game on a mobile device I have enjoyed.

I am not the only person that would love this game more if there were a few more courses, a couple new powers, and things were changed up occasionally to keep it fresh. *Old review below*Great game. Could work on the physics of the game to fix some glitches and inconsistencies in play. But a great way to get a quick play in during some downtime.. Or sit around killing time playing and chatting with your friends. Some features that would be nice:1. Let people choose if they wish to be rematched, and randomly assign who goes first. Rather than letting the winner go first. 2. Fix the physics so that bounces off of walls are more consistent. Why do I sometimes get stuck to a wall when I run into it, instead of bouncing off of it?? Makes no sense. 3. Give us some updates. A new special power. A new map or two. There are other things. But those are the big ones. DD2 was probably the biggest disappointment of my phone game history.Everything that is terrible with mobile games today is present in it. To be fair, the game probably would have been fun, but I‚Äôll pass with the over the top ad blasting.Very thankful they left this one be.

You could add a flintlock pistol and all the different rifles that were used during that time, a grenade that the Grenadiers used would be cool.  You‚Äôve made machine guns and a flamethrower, why not a Gatling gun and a cannon? I understand that this may be hard to do, but many people would appreciate this, especially history buffs like me. The first four apps are amazing! Keep up the great work. Great graphic and the gun operating is awesome, just like the real thing. Best gun simulator app ever! Totally worth the money! Just one more improvement to make, can you make it so that we can duel with our friends using the guns through Bluetooth or wifi? That is a good idea I think, and will probably make the app better I love everything that the game has, especially since you guys used the real reload for the Colt 1873. I just think that the Colt 1873's reload could be easier since there is a certain part on the gun that you must touch, and a Weaphones game is not complete with such a short amount of guns. It's less guns than Weaphones: Pack 1 Free! And just look at the full versions of Pack 1, Pack 2, and the WWII pack. "

It‚Äôs a Unique game and art Style. The music is sometimes pretty good. I only have 2 complaints. One is the glitches. Some times the game will freeze up, and sometimes it won‚Äôt save some levels you beat. That can get old really fast. And the second complaint is the is the Coins. My god the Coins. Finding the last coin on a level is the most annoying thing in the world. The coins Sparkle should be a lot bigger than what it is. And there should be more to do with them. Like Costumes for giant and people. Or something lol. But besides that I don‚Äôt regret buy the game at all. I had a feeling a lot of people would be leaving negative reviews because they‚Äôre salty about actually having to pay game devs for their work. But this game is worth every penny. It‚Äôs funny, entertaining, and progressively more challenging. The graphics are great and really refreshing compared to a lot of stuff out there at the moment. Overall, just really well visually designed. It‚Äôs the kind of game that could work well under a freemium model, but I‚Äôm glad they haven‚Äôt done that. Would love some sort of option for a zen mode in the future. "

I love the use of the models from Unity Assets. The hair style collection is nice as well. I do have a few recommendations. The club leaders don‚Äôt do much. They just stand there and you can‚Äôt do much other than kill them or join their club. Maybe create more classrooms so that they can have classes and be programmed as normal students? Also, their outfits are kind of odd. Just make them wear the same school uniforms as everyone else! I like the addition of the clerks and store managers, but they don‚Äôt really do much either, just stand there. Maybe give them something to do? And maybe get students to visit the stores and stuff during lunch ours and after school. The students themselves are very robot like, only moving to class and lunch. While you can interact with them, it‚Äôs very minimal. Maybe have them interact with each other? This goes for teachers too. I am happy that teachers are now more active, as they didn‚Äôt do much at all before. Add student lunches, and maybe a seat for the player. And give the students activity! They really don‚Äôt do anything while in club hours, just stand there. Also, I think I speak for most players when I say that we need a house, since we could start in the house rather in front of the school. And maybe give other students and teachers homes as well instead of having them spawn outside a very large tunnel. I‚Äôm happy with the improvements this game has gotten. Keep up the good work! Ok the school isn‚Äôt really interesting all the classes are the same and in clubs you can‚Äôt do anything but it‚Äôs swimming you swim -.-  I wish the school had just something anything on the walls it‚Äôs more like a prison than a school it places. The bathrooms are just quickly put together there aren‚Äôt even doors or a sink it‚Äôs not really  decorated it‚Äôs just some bricks and a toilet I wish there were goals like kill this person or somthing. I don‚Äôt know what yen is used for other than buying drinks     Also they students are so robotic they go from class to class it‚Äôs almost creepy how they ALL walk or run in unison with 100 kids it‚Äôs just unsettling to me at least. The principal doesn‚Äôt do anything you can say hi or bye but that‚Äôs all besides killing him. Same with the club leaders they stand there you can join there club but that‚Äôs really it. I wish you could costomisethe students as you can yourself and the guy you can change there outfits but that‚Äôs it.           I wish there was somthing more to do other than kill people that‚Äôs it there no goals or anything. GOALS NEED TO BE A THING or multiplayer or something it‚Äôs boring you don‚Äôt do anything if u kill somebody they don‚Äôt respon so u run out of people really quickly aswell I am a HUGE anime fan. As much as I love this game, I don't get the vibe that I get from watching other people play the ACTUAL thing. Ik that you can't do EXACTLY everything in that game, but you could add a basement and you should be able to decrease a captive victims sanity. The way you can do this is drug them, then store them in a box. It would also be cool to ACTUALLY interact with the A.I. Like you can compliment them, or do random task for them! You should also make a popularity meter, to show how popular you are. You should also lay out weapons at the school, like outside. I'm using a IPhone 5c, and idk if it's the game, or my phone type, but I would appreciate it if you would add the weapons at the front of the school. I would also like to play ""Cupid"" for other people. You should also add a rival, like a rival that will compete with you for senpai. Like he/she would hang around senpai and talk to him, you will have to either ""Play Cupid"", Kill Her, Drown Her, Or you can drug a person and decrease their sanity and make them kill the rival. Other than this, I LOVE this game! It's AWESOME! And I hope you continue the updates!-Your Biggest Fan "

I never did anything else. My boss fired me for not going to work, my wife left because I forgot to pay attention to her, and I lost my house because I forgot to pay my bills. My parents disowned me for not doing anything and just playing. My dog died because I forgot to feed him and I ate him because I didn‚Äôt have money to do anything else. I spent the money my parents left me on this game. The high tech graphics of this game made me fell in love with one of the characters. I love this game. This is a game most people probably only play on the toilet at work so I didn‚Äôt expect depth or complexity from it but even for a toilet game from very early on it becomes obvious it is all just a money grab. the opponents start slapping perfectly on every single turn starting right after the first match. The opponents also very quickly start doing FAR more damage than you with each slap which means you lose every time you make even a small mistake which takes a lot of suspense driven fun out of the game and makes the slap meter feel pretty pointless. Coins earned in game can level the playing field by providing boosts but boosts are only temporary and cost far more than you stand to earn which means you will very quickly find yourself watching endless amounts of ads or spending dollar after dollar on coins just to progress further.  Honestly it‚Äôs a standard .io style toilet game money grab that‚Äôs a little less intrusive with ads and a little more demanding of cash. Nothing more nothing less. No depth no complexity, take it for what it is. However making it so difficult to progress or even play the game correctly without watching 10 ads or spending $10 gives it one of the lowest ratings a toilet game can get The game is pretty fun and simple but it‚Äôs completely 100% built around apps. I mean you don‚Äôt have to pay anything, actually I don‚Äôt think you have an option to. But to actually progress and win you basically have to watch a 30 second app to win every match and another 30 second app to increase your earnings for that match. If you don‚Äôt do this, your opponents increase in health and strength and you can‚Äôt possibly keep up unless you‚Äôre watching these apps.Unfortunately it‚Äôs the same 4 or 5 apps over and over and they‚Äôll just drive you crazy!!! I mean I get it, these games have to make their money somehow so I don‚Äôt blame them. It‚Äôs a funny and entertaining game and they never false advertised. So for that I give them 3 stars for perfectly implementing their ads on a fun simple game. But I find all these ads very annoying and too necessary to be able to enjoy the game.

The first time I‚Äôve heard of it is when it was automatically downloaded on my device. At first I didn‚Äôt think it was a good game, but when I went to see it, I found out I‚Äôve been wasting my time not playing this game. Now there‚Äôs a sequel to it. Pogo cat is one of my favorite cats, it‚Äôs a cute one and it‚Äôs a great meatshield in true form. This game is so cool, but I just wish that it was more exciting. Can there be enemies you can jump on to get extra rewards, and can there be a new enemy after each 5 or 10 levels. That would make the game a lot more exciting, even though pogo cat is free from all the battles -_-. Sry pogo cat üòÖ. Anyways great game and keep updating it :p :). It is an above average game (mobile game wise at least) in my opinion. It is not nearly as good as battle cats, but you will find yourself constantly just wanting to try one more time over and over. It can burn time quickly and from what I have saw doing missions in the game can give you cat food in battle cats so it is also rewarding. I would takes this over any type of voodoo copy paste game that have infested the app store. It kind of feels like your playing a battle cats minigame because it does so we'll keeping the battle cats mood. Im gonna continue playing it and hope this game also gains traction, definitely not deleting this anytime soon. Thanks for another quality game ponos. I know ponos hasn‚Äôt worked in this game in a long time but I think I would like to see new platforms like one that may moves side to side. Next I want new moves such as when you are in mid-air you can swipe down to jab down super fast. also I want to see enemies (the jab could be used to hurt defeat them) maybe one stays in place and jumps up and down (maybe even on a pogo stick) and one that moves back in forth in the air flying and lastly ones you can‚Äôt kill that let you jump higher BUT it will remove your second jump also if you get hit by an enemy you die. Lastly I want to be able to pick what ability you upgrade. (Also maybe levels and different backgrounds like a cave or mountain or a beach) "

Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite. Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the blood of your subjects stain the ground red. It‚Äôs charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained realities of war.

Command troops of archers, swordsmen, and more as you protect a chain of islands from marauders, but one wrong move can prove costly. Tense, slick, and stylish, Bad North is a heady blend of tactical combat, strategic planning, and intuitive controls. You basically just deploy units to fight off invaders. That‚Äôs it. I appreciate the design of the game and that you have to think strategically about where to move which units, utilize terrain, etc. but after a while it gets a little boring. It would be great if the combat was just one part of the game, and players would also have to manage resources and defenses of the islands themselves. Taxation, revenue, fortifications, economies, trade ‚Äî these could all be used to impact success. It would make the game much more complex, interesting and re-playable. I‚Äôd even pay more for that. Also, I‚Äôm experiencing reload issues; the game kept hanging while islands were being generated at startup. I deleted my game and tried a new one, but that didn‚Äôt work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled. We‚Äôll see... I‚Äôve heard a ton about crashes in this game. I have a beat up iPhone 7 and it still runs very well. I‚Äôve played for maybe 10 hours and had about 3-4 crashes which haven‚Äôt impeded the fun and strategic appeals of this game. I was on the edge about buying it because so many people said it would barely run, but I ended up getting it and have loved it since. It‚Äôs totally worth the money. If you have an iPhone 7 or above and you‚Äôre interested, you should totally get this game. Also I‚Äôve had it on 60 FPS instead of 30 and it makes it look way better and still runs great.Edit: I would love to see some new type of unit, it would really spice things up for the people playing it through more than once. Maybe a catapult that you can only get later in the campaign or even a ship of your own with archers or guys with crossbows on it. Crossbows itself could be a good idea. As long as it‚Äôs not too similar to any other troops. "

Enterprise tower was on its starboard side and not it‚Äôs port side. It was and still is against naval regulation to have a tower on the left side because of the direction the props would spin would cause the plane to veer left naturally so a constant adjustment must be made. So with the planes veering left they wanted them to be able to slide off into the ocean if landing went wrong instead of sliding into the tower. The Japanese has two carriers with port side towers that paid the price for it many times and I believe that is accurately portrayed on their part in this game. Also add some brief history about the ships if you could. Why not teach a little bit about each shop and what makes them famous instead of gamers just seeing ‚Äúbig boats with big guns‚Äù let them learn why they went down in history. I‚Äôll be playing and destroy most of a players health then another ship sinks that very player. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with that it‚Äôs the point of the game sink the enemy ships. But when that happens I want to at least get a kill assist because I destroyed most of the health, and did most of the work, used up valuable ammo and, nothing no kill assist, nothing! And it hasn‚Äôt given me kill assists for things like that and I get no rewards! It has happened to me at least 5 times and I am getting really mad. I just want it to give me a kill assist but  it hasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs been making me want to delete the game. Please, make it give kill assists if you take at least half of the enemy‚Äôs health. Other than that I like the game which is why I haven‚Äôt deleted it. I hope you can change that soon. And one more thing WHY DO I NEED ITUNES TO UPDATE IT, THAT‚ÄôS STUPID.     Have a nice day. It‚Äôs a good game and I highly suggest it, but the adds are the same constantly and long a majority of the time. And having prices on ships that need actual money is insane especially since it‚Äôs really difficult for newbies to rank since their going against people who use actual money on their ships. And the random team ups are unfair, like it would have one team with 6 battleships and the other team with 5 tiny ships that contain torpedos. And not only that but the way we can earn special items like electronics and turrets are only in spins and the spins are giving me nothing but crap. If there‚Äôs a way to fix these that will be great, otherwise it‚Äôs a really good game. And not to mention that this game is full of hackers like their are people who have small torpedo boats that have a roughly 100,000 hp and when I hit them a torpedo nothing happens!! "

As you chomp through a never-ending grid of dots, fruit, and multi-colored ghosts, a creeping glitch pushes you ever forward. Fortunately, a slew of upgrades‚Äîfrom lasers to bombs‚Äîwill help you demolish ghosts and forge a new high score. It‚Äôs a lovingly assembled package that‚Äôll delight both arcade aficionados and casual gamers. I love Pac-man. I always thought the classical frenzy would be my favorite, yet this twist, is amazing. It starts easy and gets harder, yet in a more frantic way. The power ups, power pellets, fruit that Pac man eats and gets more points than normal for a duration, and 256 dot-chains that destroy all ghosts on the screen, are all incredible. Also it is cool that the PAC dot chains are 256 of them since the original PAC man had 256 levels then was supposed to end, although I don't know how anyone is supposed to be that, which made the original fun as well. If I could make one suggestion, although this game seems to be perfect and I understand if it doesn't get added, is I would love to see the ability to upgrade fruits. Thank you for reading and I love this game so much! Once you've collected everything the only replay value is competing for 256 chains. I'm in the top 400 now and that's the only reason I keep playing. There are terrible bugs with the pac-dot chains. About 1 out of 5 times you eat a powerup it breaks the chain. I've lost many dozens of 256 chains because of this. Going the wrong way on the ""fast"" arrows usually breaks the PAC-dot chain. If the game lags at all then that breaks the PAC-dot chain. They need to have a better method of figuring out when the chain is broken besides timing based. However the powerup bug is the worst. Trying to level up all the power ups in this game is a huge joke. I have maxed out the main 3, but now that they increased the max level to 12 there's no way a person will play or pay to max out all 20 power ups. And that is one of the achievements - the final one I need - is having maxed out all power ups. It would cost hundreds of dollars if you actually paid for coins to do it. So they've really broken the cost / value ratio of this game, and that's made it impossible to get all achievements unless you want to spend an insane amount of money. "

You can choose a name for your truck, but there needs to be more options for the names. In my opinion the best trucks and modifications are those that can only be purchased with Gold. It costs a lot of Gold to get these and it is very difficult to get the Gold Coins. You get them by placing in the top of the leader standings of the Season races, this is hard to do. You can watch a video to get one of these gold coins but most of the time the videos are not available. The last way to get the Gold is to purchase them with a credit card, but I don't have that kind of money, and that is the reason for 3 stars since you can't give half a star. If the Gold wasn't so hard to obtain then this would be a 5 star rating. So if you want to go all the way to the top of the leader boards in Season races for that big reward, be aware that it is very challenging but also very fun at the same time.Have Fun and Good Luck! Love this game add I just ran across it the other day. I started with you guys later release mmx hill climb 2 and loved it at first but the canyon stage got it deleted. Back to this release, I've literally stopped playing csr2 because of it and will eventually put add much money into it if you guys can give us an update. We need more options on the trucks, tuning etc. More customizing and more things to be purchased with cash or fewer gold's. The thing I love especially is that I can play off line and build my trucks up, but the issue I'm having as of late is where we start and finish a MP race online and it just freezes, I have to force close the game and come back. The record is accurate as I haven't lost but I hate that one inconvenience. Love the graphics! Enjoyable, yet challenging! With a little patience and fun racing challenges you can upgrade your vehicles without spending lots of money. The Support staff is helpful and does their best to answer your questions quickly, unlike so many others games. Only problem I‚Äôve had is the program crashing in the WWF mode. It will allow me to race in Multiplayer, but I can‚Äôt race my cars in individual mode when I‚Äôm trying to gain WWF coins to upgrade. I press the RACE button and the program instantly crashes. I noticed recently Hutch upgraded and did some bug fixes on some of their other games. Hutch, could you PLEASE do that with MMX, too!

That‚Äôs absolutely frustrating to me since I‚Äôve thrown so many hours into this just to keep starting over! So annoying! Fix the bugs please! This is a very easy puzzle game that might be good for beginners but for anyone with experience, you should stray away. The mechanics have enough variation that you‚Äôll enjoy it up until level 40, when you start to notice that the levels are just reused. I played until level 55 just to see if there was more beyond that point but there was nothing that I hadn‚Äôt seen before. "

For example in mission of the ‚Äúold pirates secrates‚Äù u must give them 10k to stop chasing and there is no option for u to not to and end it by force.- also adding more states of the relationships between u and other kingdoms would be good because it gets boring just going around the map in every location freely. For example if u have really bad relation ship in specific kingdom u will be chased and will have to fight them or escape using some kinds of artifacts (which i hope will be added).- and lastly i would love if u could attack ports and be able to capture them making it ur investment and defend it from attackers. Which than u could supply with guns and ammos and materials which would be late game but still possible. Definitely the best pirate-themed game for the iPad (by a large margin).  Picture it as a very polished Sid Meier‚Äôs Pirates! but with 25x the missions, stronger graphics, a fantastic score and 100% less redundant ballroom dancing.So why only 4 stars instead of 5?In a word: land.  This game has about a half dozen land quest types (they rotate randomly).  And its during these quests where the polish is tarnished.  A prime example: on a mission to save an Emperor‚Äôs daughter, you run to a pirate haven to save her. Often, the haven doesn‚Äôt render until you‚Äôre in the middle of town where you promptly get blown apart or trapped in geography.  Likewise, some trees don‚Äôt render and you‚Äôll get stuck on them.  Perhaps the most common issue is the camera panning 180 degrees in the opposite direction of a fight because of some object behind you that you‚Äôre stuck on. Additionally, your pirate will move a bit oddly through the land missions as if on rails (randomly). If the developers could fix the issues with land quests (giving them the same polish as the vibrant sea battles), this game would be an easy 5 star winner and one of the best games on the iPad. UPDATE: With the newest update, my expectations have, indeed, been exceeded! 3rd person boarding and land missions are absolutely bonkers! Been on since day 1 and I hope this game NEVER dies! ORIGINAL:Supremely bummed to see my original review missing :( .   Anywho- this awesome pirate game is the best all-round free-roam pirate action RPG on the App Store! At first glance, simple mechanics and mission chasing are abound!      However, what most fail to see is the actual depth of the game. For starters, it's a social game that allows you to play with other people cooperatively or anonymously. You can also upgrade your crew AND captain. There are mysteriously powerful artifacts to find, mythical sea monsters, and a budget for all of it..so venture wisely. Otherwise, the graphics and camera angles matched with the realistic sounds give this game movie-like qualities...just zoom in on deck and sail for a while with your friends, it's a blast! Then cooperate in pirate battles...it's a literal blast!    Sixth Star!!! The 6th star goes to this game because the developers have gone above and beyond providing excellent customer service.

The game is kind of like if overwatch and fortnite had a baby that was much more interesting to play. So what is the number 1 thing all fps players love? Cosmetics, something this game will offer for free in daily login  challenges and the season pass itself (even if you don‚Äôt pay). But what if you want to buy the season pass and your parents say no? Just save up, the free season pass will also offer the in game currency as a reward along with the login thing (which comes in generous amounts, but it would still take some time to save up for). I think as long as they reward people who level up their pass with decent rewards everyone is happy. I like the different game modes especially ranked, even though the randoms on my team give me a headache- it‚Äôs still fun and challenging. I await for the new features the devs add! I hope we gain a chat system or clans or even the ability to make friends and form teams, because in a team based game working together is necessary, along with having teammates you can depend on! So I hopped on this game thinking it was going to be another fun 5v5 fast paced arcade game to pass time and have fun. The first couple of games I noticed how off the controls and sensitivity are and how the fire modes have horrible aim on all sensitivity‚Äôs (no it‚Äôs not me, I played plenty of first person shooters and never have the issue with aiming.) when shooting it accelerates horribly and slowly even on the highest setting and goes faster at the worst times, it‚Äôs unbalanced. The game is also rigged, TDM goes up to 20 kills however the game ends in the end and you can notice that the other team doesn‚Äôt even have over 10 kills, meanwhile your team has 20 deaths because of bugs in the game that auto drain health (no I am not being shot by anyone because the other team is dead and respawning by this time, I run around many corners in hopes to get away but the bug just zaps my health.)  also the characters are HIGHLY unbalanced. The tank has high health which you have to unload two clips into him, but his weapon does so much damage that your only choice is to unload a clip, run and heal and hope that he‚Äôs a bot and hasn‚Äôt changed positions. Overall I don‚Äôt recommend this game in its current state and hopefully it improves somehow. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a one star is because it‚Äôs not a bad game, it just needs improvements. It‚Äôs like any other 5v5 fps, it just has too many bugs to Mark it as ‚Äúfun.‚Äù First off I love the game it‚Äôs really good I see nothing wrong with the game I literally play this game everyday nice work. Now things that should be added to this game to make it better and more fun 1. Y‚Äôall should add crouching, jumping, and either slide or jetpack. This should be added so that in battle is easier to take cover and to get to a safe spot. 2. Having the ability to change characters in game. I wish that this was a thing because if your in battle and you wanna use a different character you can‚Äôt So please add that. 3. Add more modes. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong tdm and domination (zone capture) there fun but you should add different modes and events. 4. Friends list and multiplayer private rooms. Now this made me a little sad that y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt add these but please do cause there are many times when I wanna play my friends and can‚Äôt do it. 5. Gun camos. This is nothing major just a little something to spice the game up. Yea that‚Äôs about it all y‚Äôall need to do is add those things in and it will be goodüëç. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

A bunker, a cannon, a rocket launcher... A oil drill, a depot for ammunition... That's mostly everything.. You need to use the oil to get money to make stuff to protect your oil... Go it? Lol.... I toss more ga Es than I ever actually get into and play.... This is one of those games where hours can pass and you walk away like..dam... What should I do next time.. Lol. It's cool This game is simple, has 3 towers, oil truck and oil refinery you need to defend, has upgrades as well but doesn't say what the difference of them do, some are obvious but ""income"" and ""resources"" I'm afraid which to use because I don't know what they do and you get a little amount of skill points each level. And no purchase in game, once you buy it there's no other purchases after which is great!Downside of why I'm giving it 3/5 stars is because there's no campaign, very little towers (3 to be exact), no game types, one map, unknown enemy spawn (I hate that) and meh sounds. Make a second one with more towers and more game types with not so annoying oil running out so fast and I'll easily pay $2-$3. Nice if you don't mind these small things. UPDATE: played the game and found a little ""glitch"" where an infantryman shot at the oil rig and I was able to repair it and he just kept shooting it, during that all my guys got oil. Then what I did is put a bunch of Rockets around my base and see how long I will last and ended up running out of money because oil spot runs out of oil and I got to wave 23 I feel like I've beaten in the game.. Fast paced game that will keep you on your toes! Simple game play with some upgrades to weapons. I would love to see ability to keep upgrading weapons to higher levels to combat the additional abilities of the bad guys in later waves. I am a fan of your games, keep up the good work!!! "

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Looney tunes in my childhood, but this game makes me change my mind. It‚Äôs gameplay is good, it‚Äôs super competitive, and it is extremely addicting to play.,which leads to problems.I‚Äôm going to talk about the in-app purchases in each in game currency to tell the developers to fix these things, or they will ruin the game. The coins are no problem, they can be earned super easily. The ?illudium?‚Äôs purchases are ridiculous. They cost about 100 gems for 2 illudiumÔºÅIn perspective, you can spend 5 energy to get 2 illudium and a bunch of other items! The developers must be drunk when designing this market. Change this please!The energy system is way too expensive and way too little. I have to wait for like 2 hours to play it again. Maybe the energy cap raises as you level up? This way more people will play it. The daily tickets are fine, but I wish there would be more places to get them. The golden tickets...no, I am not spending any money on them, they are simply a place for new players to spend their money. Seriously, 200 gems for ONE golden ticket? I will never buy that.I seriously like this game, but it punishes free-players(including me) for not spending 50 dollars on some golden tickets. I‚Äôm sorry to see this game be like this, so please change these features! Sadly but not surprisingly, greed ruined another potentially amazing free to play game. The art and animation are wonderful, and it‚Äôs a really fun concept. Unfortunately, the free to play overlords in the company want your wallet more than your praises. I don‚Äôt like free to play models, but I accept them. This game, however, has only been out 2 weeks and is already geared for whales (big spenders). It uses special events (holidays, etc) as an excuse for you to spend more money rather than giving you much free stuff (what other free to play games do). Sure you can earn some, but they also offer tons of rewards you can‚Äôt possibly earn without paying real money. There is literally no way to reach them otherwise. And the gems you can earn for free don‚Äôt go very far at all. Everything you need in game currency for is way too expensive. I have paid money in other games with a much better rewards system, but I will not be spending a dime on this one unless something changes. And for a game that revolves around brawling with other players, it does a pretty terrible job at pairing you with a fair match most of the time. I may keep playing a little longer to see if the devs are listening, but for what could have been amazing, I feel pretty disappointed. Two stars, one for the animation team and one for the designers. None for the bigwigs who are way too greedy for a game that just came out. Great concept, wonderful characters, fun and addictive gameplay. However, store is a disaster as everything is way overpriced. 300 gems for 5-100 pieces of a character, cmon. At least 300 gems for most store items most of which you can get for free just by playing. In lower levels hundreds of trophies means a difference in your battles, but at higher levels I‚Äôm at least 3000 trophies higher than opponents and lose more than I win. Ages no sense. Crate system is awful and extremely flawed. Went to work with 4 crates under an hour to open. Came back and all were stolen. You never get to attack an opponent with less than an hour on a crate yet somehow you always can lose them no matter how much time you have left to open them. Constantly try to start brawls, it loads and then tells you the crate is already open. Then why is it an option to fight that opponent? This happens a LoT! This game could be awesome. Look at all my complaints and I still give it 3*! Small side complaint, where are classic characters like Speedy, Taz, Tweety, Henery Hawk? Wile E and Roadrunner are special characters only which is fine but we have a few obscure characters but not all the staples. Loads of potential lots of aggravation at higher levels. Just tired of losing to people thousands of points below me. "
‚ÄéFOTONICA,"Ever wondered what running at 140mph feels like? FOTONICA is a first-person game about the thrill of speed and traveling flawlessly through complex environments.  One-handed controls: hold your finger down to run, release to jump, hold in mid-air to dive and land. FOTONICA is simple, but is not easy: it follows a tradition of arcade games that are easy to pick up and almost impossible to master. A multi-layered level design across eight different tracks, together with a procedural endless mode make for a game that is incredibly deep. Think you can outrun your friends? Try the split-screen versus challenges.  The visuals are a treat for the nostalgic player but also for those hungry for new aesthetics. Every pixel is drawn to convey the maximum sense of speed, an exhilarating journey through light and void. - 8 Levels to explore and master. - Plus 3 different endless levels to compete for high-scores. - Two-player split-screen multiplayer mode on the same device! - 18 Achievements to unlock plus game stats.  - Online rankings. - Beautiful, smooth, and unique vector-style graphics. - Electronic music by Michael Manning, Nicol√≤ Sala, and legendary composer Baiyon. - 2 Difficulty settings to let you play an even faster version of FOTONICA. - Play in landscape or portrait mode. - No ads, no in-app purchases. - Record and share replays of your best runs. -OTHER REVIEWS- POCKET GAMER - ""As good as competitive, hold-your-breath-every-second, first-person racing gets"" Chris Priestman, pocketgamer.co.uk ""EUROGAMER - 8/10 ‚ÄúUsain Bolt trapped in a feverish Tron daydream‚Äù Kristan Reed, eurogamer.net  "" ""GAMEPRO - 5/5  ‚ÄúThis one button game has a lot more mileage than you might expect‚Äù  Nathan Meunier, gamepro.com "" ""THE CREATORS PROJECT - ‚ÄúA veritable black hole to lose yourself in‚Äù  Emerson Rosenthal, thecreatorsproject.com "" ""ARS TECHNICA - ‚ÄúStriking and instantly impressive‚Äù Ben Kuchera, arstechnica.com"" ""ROCK, PAPER, SHOTGUN - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a remarkable game, and unlike anything else I‚Äôve played‚Äù  John Walker, rockpapershotgun.com "" -AWARDS- ‚ÄúFantastic Arcade Spotlight Game 2014‚Äù ‚ÄúEuroGamer Expo Selection‚Äù ‚Äú54th Biennale of Art in Venice Selection‚Äù ** FOTONICA is designed for iPhone 4 and above.

Me being a fan of games like Super Hexagon, WaveWave, and Boson X, this game is almost a dream come true! One thing that really bugs me, however, is that the timer and score at the bottom of the screen are hidden if you use your right hand to play! If the devs could put an option to swap the score and timers to the left side, that would make this game even more awesome than it is. I first found this game when the Ouya was new, and from the point of view of someone who can never find a good mobile game to play, I‚Äôve bought this on at least 3 different platforms, and should it eventually reach console, I‚Äôll most likely buy it there too. I don‚Äôt know what it is about this game that is so addicting, but the ‚Äò70s score-centered type of gameplay, combined with the high speeds you‚Äôd only experience drifting the touges of Mt. Akina, while still keeping the aesthetic of the game very simple yet very informative of what is happening around you... it‚Äôs something I have yet to experience through any medium. This game is a blessing, yet a curse - a reminder of what no other game has ever strived to achieve and probably never will again. So I literally just got this game to help out with my insomnia based off the simplicity of the design and animation type. So far I love it and the music is super relaxing, you can also play your own if you prefer that. The color hack I used was simple and it doesn‚Äôt require what your phone doesn‚Äôt already have. I use this also just to change the mood of my phone. Lol add smart contrast and reduce white point and you‚Äôll have a dope looking color scheme for all Apple stock apps.For this game Go to settings>general>accessibility>display accommodations[turn it on]>color filters>turn the intensity up> then change the hue to whatever color options you like. Once that‚Äôs done go back to the game and the white lines will now be filled with the hue that you chose for your phone.Quick tip:Enable accessibility shortcuts and triple tapping will make this so much faster to turn on and off once the hue is set.Hope you guys enjoy this game as much as I do! P.s- I‚Äôm thinking about doing a vlog on live app reviews using the new screen recording feature in the new iOS 11 update. Let me know if you enjoy this tip! "

There are some lag issues with older iPhones (I assume that‚Äôs the issue with my 6s) but overall doesn‚Äôt ruin the game. Great time killer and the look of the game is really good compared to the trashy graphics of most App Store games. After installing and play the game,I say to myself that this it‚Äôs the easiest version of Mr. Jump.

This game lives up to Mr. Jump and is totally recommended if you can‚Äôt get Mr. Jump for $3. And P.S. this is not a geometry dash rip-off because that game is way challenging. This game is stupid fun, it has a perfect difficulty curve, and excellent level design. There is one flaw, however. The end points of a level are these small portal like objects. In some levels, it‚Äôs easy to jump over them. If this happens, you restart the level. In Level 11-3 it‚Äôs near impossible to not fly over the end point. This could be easily fixed by just making the hitbox to get into the portal much larger, to avoid cheap deaths. "

The graphic and sound design are phenomenal, and the game itself is a blast. However, it does have its share of problems. Almost everything has a daily limit, and I feel this limit is too strict. Sometimes, it makes some sense with hunts and the portal, but there‚Äôs already an energy system in the game. Only being able to do each hunt 5 times a day is fine because there‚Äôs multiple hunts to do, and the portal because one doesn‚Äôt want the player to achieve all of the rewards so fast. However, I believe the limit system should be used for each individual favor, portal battle, etc. instead of a total limit. The current system is way too restricting and makes the game much grindier as one has to wait a day to do certain things. The limit system is sometimes fine on its own, however with the energy system it is ridiculous. The only time the two systems come together is for hunts which is fine, but the portal, monster cave (which I think the torches for entering are too rare), favors, and others shouldn‚Äôt be this restricting. I also believe the energy system should be a little faster. Other than that, good game. This is a fantastic game, hence everyone else‚Äôs responses, but I wish the hunts made sense. I just recently got into the game as I mean it just came out but it really seeps into the idea of pay to win. Which I mean you don‚Äôt have to but to get anywhere or progress you do, the weapon development//upgrading is already beginning to feel very grind-like (which I don‚Äôt necessarily mind) but the issue is it doesn‚Äôt pay off well. Even after referring back to hunts when progressing into the game 6 turns is ridiculous, I was even tempted to pay (which I don‚Äôt mind either but I don‚Äôt want to pay for something in which the money I spend is going to require me to end up spending kore to catch up.) all in all I love the game but it‚Äôs lacking the engaging experience of progression through earning and I feel like it falls short for that reasoning. I‚Äôm personally going to continue to play but just like clash royale eventually the money grab will get on my nerves and rather than wanting to pay I won‚Äôt pay at all. I needed a new mobile game in which I just hope these little issues can be reduced and the game could be one of the best games to be released on the App Store. I just hope the devs are actually listening and aren‚Äôt trying to monetize as bad as candy crush was. Godspeed and I hope the best for this game.üôèüèΩ Love this game so much that many ideas started sprawling everywhere in my mind, I have a couple of them or two. The first one is since I found out that there‚Äôs a samurai hero in this game and I love samurai very much here‚Äôs this: involve a far eastern part of the world of knighthood, where you can meet the different version of the knights of rage, why not put the samurai of virtue: they master the art of virtues and allows them to summon yokai from their sword called yokai-no-tsurugi. And the second one is one that could make anybody love it more is that they should involve before I say this well I know in many fantasy genre we are treated to dragon knights and all that, nothing personal about that so here‚Äôs one type of knight you would love, the Dino knights! Awesome idea right? I think that be amazing enough to have into knighthood. I mean I‚Äôm thinking about the Dino might rage gauntlet, Dino knight heroes, dinosaur type monsters and all, trust many dinosaur fans are going to love that so much without a doubt. So what do you think? Impressed? Intrigued? Amazed that such an idea came to mind? Cause let me tell ya, it amazed me too when that came to me. "

Some are really well received, like fighterz, and others not so much. When I found out there was an official mobile dragon ball game I was sure that it would be a poorly made cash grab of a game. I was very wrong. While it is true that you can buy an in game premium currency in the form of dragon stones it is not completely necessary to buy them. They are quite accessible if you are willing to put in the time. I myself have only spent a small amount of money on the game and only when there is a big discount. Even without spending much money on it I have over 100 top tier characters and after years of playing I still have a lot of fun. It can be very grindy at times and there are some times in between events that can be really boring if you are high level and have most of the story stuff done. However there are almost always events of some sort going on and there‚Äôs almost always a new exciting character to summon for, seeing as that‚Äôs how the game supports itself. Overall it is a really fun game that gives a real sense of achievement when you finally beat a really tough event or grind to buy something big in the baba shop. Of all the dragon ball games created up to this point, it‚Äôs probably the one with the most work put into it and the most balanced of all. It‚Äôs really a good game and I highly recommend it to any dragon ball fans out there. Let's start out with the only bad thing here. It's Pay to win. Now that that's out of the way. Let's talk about all the good this game has to offer. Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle is a unique game with a very unique twist on the usual beat em ups. This is refreshing to say the least since most of us Dragon Ball fans are used to that formula for those games and the mechanic can either make or break the game. You collect these orbs that let you obtain ki for your ki meter that can be seen whenever you fight something. This game also comes with it's own story mode, can be completely f2p if the person so chooses (which is still viable to this day), and new things are added all the time. Sure, you can empty your purse of money into this game to get rare characters you want, however, the game already gives you plenty of dragon stones (this games Gotcha currency). Each of the story missions give you three stones and there are almost always events that give you special missions to gain more stones. I'd say it's worth it to grind a bit and earn a bit. It makes the experience of the game more genuine and fun. As a player myself that has trash luck, you can always make the best of your situations. That's why there are so many ways to play this game. And it's still being updated and modified! In my opinion, this is one of the best Dragon Ball games of it's time. Just look past that stamina issue... I‚Äôve been playing since the global version was released and have logged in 90% of those days since it was released. I‚Äôve seen this game grow into something great. Compared to other mobile anime summon type games Dokkan takes the other by a lot. You could spend zero money on this game and still have a great time, good characters, and enough stones to summon. The addition of a guaranteed SSR character on a x50 stone summon is huge and was the biggest step in the right direction. Also the inclusion of rates was huge too. When it‚Äôs celebration time either monthly or annually they give out honestly more than enough stones if you want to summon or save. This recent 5 year celebration has been the best yet and I expect to be better than the last each time. You could skip the monthly banners and save your stones because once the big annual celebrations hit you are treated to amazing summons with tickets, loads of stones, and content then you can summon on the banners and get the monthly Dokkan characters you missed. Lastly the coin system with 10 coins per 50 stone multi is monumental because it does push you summon more, but there‚Äôs an end goal in mind. Thank you Dokkan you have built memories, pasted time when bored, generated hype, and have created an amazing experience overall. I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs in store years down the line! "

To start it off, the first issues is in the app and the game itself but I keep getting network errors so I‚Äôm guessing that they‚Äôre problems with the Ubisoft servers or something.  Can‚Äôt enter my Ubisoft account or whatever it is it asks to customize your dancer card within the app and I can‚Äôt access the online feature of the game itself.  The second issues is the weird one.  The first two smart phone devices work fine without many issues but all other devices that have been paired with game/console repeat the same issue of not showing up on the screen.  They produce sound effects when joining the game and show character selection after picking a song like all other devices but on the tv it won‚Äôt show their name or any sort of visual cue to their existence however when dancing it shows a third and forth bar going up as they dance but it won‚Äôt show their names at the top or let them know how they‚Äôre doing with each move like the other two.  And they also get a score at the end of the song and that‚Äôs the only proof of their existence on the ps4 side.  I hope for some update somewhere to fix this When I first got this game, the controls were working fine but the more I danced, it got worse. I get disconnected even in the middle of songs which is annoying if I am on the world floor. I am not able to get decent scores while using this app. One time I got disconnected then I reconnected, and 10 seconds after I got disconnected again! The worst part is that I already spent $60 to buy the game, and to get the Kinect is another $100 with an adapter of $60. I can not afford the Kinect so hopefully there is an update that fixes some of the bugs soon. It is also unfair to people who have a Kinect because it tracks both arm moments (thus earning more points) while the phone controller only tracks one arm. I've heard people complain about this before so hopefully the Just Dance company will make it fair for everyone. I really hope that this review is put into consideration for the next update. Thank you. Dearest Ubisoft and Just Dance developers,   I cannot express how impressed I am with this app. Its sleek, beautiful design and multiple features for sure make it a winner. I just have a few suggestions:1. Maybe regular Wii compatibility? I understand how old Wiis are, but maybe a more simple Wi-Fi signal output would do the trick, considering most Wiis can connect to Wi-Fi.2. Maybe the ability to change your avatar and name without signing in? I am I'm 6th grade and apparently ""everything matters""üòÇ I hope you consider those suggestions for the app. However, I do have a few more suggestions for Just Dance itself: (these are totally random and might not even be possible?)1. I know how much people love custom made things, so it'd be cool if you could come up with a custom dance. First, you could pick one of the premade avatars from the other songs. Then, you could make your own moves to the duration of the song. The avatar would mirror you, you could then save it, name it and play it with your friends!2. You could make a whole other app specifically made for iPad. (Not iPad Mini, just anything that measures bigger than or equal to and iPad screen. You could do the same with Samsung or other devices. Maybe even computers. Then, using the same controller app, prop your iPad up and play Just Dance on there! (They would have to buy the different editions mobily.) is that even a word ?!?üòÇüòÇ I hope you take these into serious consideration! Thanks so much! "

The design is airtight, with seamless and consistent high-end pixel art that Nintendo themselves couldn't outdo. (Drop Wizard takes a lot of visual cues from the Kirby games, an obvious inspiration.) I love the main gameplay mechanic: it's fresh, but still has a familiar platformer feel. The characters and environments succeed one another in a very elegant way that allows you to pick up the game's ideas intuitively without rushing. Drop Wizard is PeRfEcT for mobile devices and seems truly designed with the platform in mind, not something I can say about many other developers. The music (and sound design!) is emotional and nostalgic, the art is thorough and detailed and cute, and the levels are clever and fun! One of my favorite iOS games to date. :-) Took a second to get used to the mechanics, but once I did it was really fun and addictive. Some people seem to dislike that the character is always moving, but to me that adds to the challenge. I mean, all you are doing is pressing 2 directions. The game needs a way to stay fast paced and I think maybe that is why they did that. Retro games were always tough and you would die a lot until you got the rhythm down. But that's what I liked about them. This game has that element to it, along with great retro graphics and 16-bit music. Is this up to par with a Super Nintendo game with the Super Nintendo controller? Of course not. But for a 99-cent iPhone game this is really quite great! Okay okay I love this game but the last boss is soooo hard I'm not saying that I'm going to get rid of it because I'm going to keep trying anyway when it gets to the final part in the last boss can u plz give us r HP back because the level is realy hard and when I have one ‚ù§Ô∏è left and when I beat the first part in the battle then he transform its realy heard so PLZ give us are hp back cause who ever heard of giving the boss ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è and u have ‚ù§Ô∏è or ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è game still great though.

Such as the updates, they could really be spaced out more.The good is that the replayablility is always high, you grind and find new combos to get the highest scores and it‚Äôs always a new challenge wherever you see fit. It does lag when you play it upon hours, though I feel like few face this problem since majority of us can‚Äôt sit on our phones playing this. However the designs and art of the cookies is always so beautiful and fantastic! Each set of personalities they have are always so cute and unique to their own, it adds a little bit more life to the game. Considering how the devs also try their very best to listen, there hardly is any loss to playing this game.Onto the bad that can always just be fixed.The amount of new cookies always catches me off guard since I barely get the other cookie to a decent level then I‚Äôm given more treasures and cookies to upgrade and I‚Äôm left in the dust.Also within the new update, I can‚Äôt load my previous sets of combis! In breakout mode, the sets are fine and there‚Äôs two options, the save and new option of ‚Äúcombi tips‚Äù. I can‚Äôt load the one I want, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúapply‚Äù option like there was before the update. I‚Äôve been in love with this game since the Kakao version and I‚Äôve seen it go through many stages. I‚Äôm proud to see it flourishing the way I always thought it deserved, but I‚Äôm sad to say that Ive dropped it. I‚Äôm sure the devs get hundreds of complaints everyday when they make slight changes to the game so before when I had a problem with new features, I‚Äôd just complain to myself and carry on trying to gain levels, but the recent changes are just to extreme for me to carry on, (I‚Äôm referring to the whole reworking of the treasure system). Like I said before I love Cookierun and have spent many hours playing the game, so when the new update came out I tried playing it on multiple occasions but since then, it just never felt the same. I never got back the same excitement when finishing trophy races or weekly breakouts as I did before and I was just left felt dissatisfied. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm used to playing it a certain way, I‚Äôm sure if the treasure system was always like the way it is now It would still be downloaded on all of my devices, but with the way it is now I can‚Äôt see myself ever re-downloading it. The changing if the treasure system doesn‚Äôt make it a bad game by any means and to those who‚Äôve never played it, I‚Äôd definitely recommend, but for veteran players like me who don‚Äôt get the same enjoyment out of it anymore I‚Äôd just suggest to drop it now while you still have good memories of it. Let‚Äôs get my one real complaint out of the way off the top: this game wants you to spend money on it so bad you‚Äôll think you‚Äôre in groundhog day with how many deals and bargains and packages you have to click away from. I seriously wish they‚Äôd tone it down. The only other bad thing I could say about it is strictly personal taste. I prefer simpler, procedurally generated tracks like temple run- being led around by the nose by a line of candy is a little hypnotic in a way I don‚Äôt personally enjoy. Everything else is fantastic. The character designs are adorable, they‚Äôre diverse and interesting where they absolutely could‚Äôve gotten away with not having any backstories at all, and there‚Äôs always something in this game to DO. I‚Äôve never reached a point in this game where I thought ‚Äòwell there‚Äôs nothing left to do today, better go do something else.‚Äô You stop when you feel like it and not a moment before. A complaint I HAD was that there wasn‚Äôt any benefit to spending a lot of time using one cookie, but the affection feature has changed that entirely, and now I really can‚Äôt think of anything in the actual game mechanics that isn‚Äôt solid.

I'm only level 5 but so far the game is awesome. There r skills unique to every character and some r amazing (one guy can even walk through walls). The gameplay is fluid and u have the freedom to do pretty much whatever u want as far as traversing the map goes. U can climb walls with grappling hooks, shoot through window panes, and even surprise enemies by dropping through the roof. Many pros to this game. A few cons, the auto fire and auto aim didn't seem to be working with makes it more difficult to hit targets. Another thing is at times it's a little difficult to differentiate between ur team and the enemy team because enemies health bar doesn't show up until they take damage. I've stood right next to an enemy thinking it was my teammate.  And lastly, characters with fully automatic weapons reign in this game as of now. Without auto fire and auto aim, it's incredibly hard to get kills with a semi automatic. But all in all, the game is definitely with the download and I could see it expanding and never getting boring. Download it. U won't regret it. The game is very well made like most people say it is very pay to win and there are a lot of try harder but I think if they add better team matchmaking and a really good skill based matchmaking or level based matchmaking the game would be pretty good. I wish they had more items to by in the store it‚Äôs like maybe skins or weapon xp tokens or something that you don‚Äôt have to spend real money on. The characters need better balancing the snipers need to be one shot and the DMRs need to be 3 shot minimum I should have to take three shots with a sniper to kill someone. The SMGs need a lower time to kill they are way to good. As a genuine fan of Super Mecha and Cyber Hunter, I‚Äôm massively disappointed in this latest release from NetEase. Anyone looking for a game to stand up to PUBG or Call of Duty mobile will be forgivably disappointed with Super Mech or Cyber Hunter, but Disorder is absolute garbage. Gameplay and NPC‚Äôs feel worse than an N64 game from 20 years ago. The art is cool and detailed, but I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt use the same gameplay, engine and NPC from Cyber Hunter. Download it for yourself if you want a laugh, but don‚Äôt expect to get much more. COD mobile is the new standard and with NetEase being one of the largest tech companies out there, they should be able to dedicate resources to the Dev team to make progress not regress.

First, whenever you kill an animal an ad pops up. Normally I don‚Äôt mind ads but this add pops up vertically so I can‚Äôt exit out of it and continue playing the game I have to exit out of the whole game to get rid of it but by doing so the game sends me back to the home screen so I can‚Äôt bring my kill back to base to cash in on it, wasting my bullets and losing my kill. Secondly the game doesn‚Äôt let you climb over hills to spot the animal your trying to shoot  so you have to go around and by doing so scaring away the animal. I‚Äôve heard that some of the other players were having these problems as well and I hope you can fix them this is a really awesome game! Thank you for your consideration and I hope you are able to fix these problems. I was looking for a free roam hunting game with challenges. This game fits that description perfectly! It‚Äôs loads of fun driving around. Physics and everything seem to work great! This game would be an absolute hit, if two things were fixed. 1, the ads popping up after you pick up a kill are broken. I normally don‚Äôt mind ads; but they pop up vertically on a horizontal screen, so you can‚Äôt exit out of the ad and have to restart the game and you lose your kill. Kinda beats the purpose of the game. 2, you can‚Äôt walk up any type of hill. You should be able to walk around the entire map no problem. However, these issues were stated by someone over a year ago and they‚Äôre still not fixed, so I doubt they ever will be. Which unfortunately means I will be uninstalling this game. If you guys fixed these issues I would actually be willing to spend money on this game "

This thinking person's battle game is a standout experience on iPad. This is one of my favorite games to play for sure. I recently began to play it again and while it was just as fun as it was before, there are a couple of issues I want to bring up. 1. Mid-game character freezeSometimes as I play all of the characters on the map go sort of haywire: I can‚Äôt place anymore troops nor can I move any of my already purchased troops. This is somewhat annoying as this usually happens around the middle to the end of the game and I have to completely restart my match2. Network FailuresI‚Äôm not sure if this is a problem on my end or yours, but occasionally when I am hosting a game there is a network failure where everybody is disconnected and the game resets3. Sound in the gameWhile this isn‚Äôt a part of the 3 star rating, as I create maps I find the fact that the music is located ‚Äúin space‚Äù is somewhat strange. I only noticed this because if you move your perspective around quickly it sounds like the game is going crazy, whereas it is really only the music changing between speakers and decreasing or increasing in intensity as you move. I love the concept of the game and it is fun to play. I still would purchase the game at $2 even with the short comings. It is an indie game and so I have to give the devs props for making it this far. The app is buggy and will crash sometimes which is frustrating. I believe it stems from developing the game using the unity framework for multiple OS's. This is appealing as a dev to reach the biggest audience but I believe that we get spoiled on iOS and begin to expect that you will make games natively for apple devices. I would rather wait to play a less buggy game than get frustrated because you tried to launch availability to the whole world at once. Also I would love for the ability to host games locally for times when I want to play against friends in the same room but lack Internet access.All in all I love the game, love indie devs, but wish these guys didn't cut corners and instead developed a platform specific version for iOS.

And I can‚Äôt imagine how he could fix it seeing as it‚Äôs a biological error in my part being right handed.This definitely left handed creator made a real gem here, buy it, share it, play it Reminds me of my favorite space shoot em ups from different computer platforms over the years.  Love that for a small price there are no advertisements and no in game purchases.  Game play is excellent, smooth response even when screen is filled with action. Normal and easy modes are both appreciated, it‚Äôs great to have the difficulty scalable for different levels of skill among my family members. This game is a perfect throwback to old school shoot em ups, with new twists, great levels, and great detailed retro artwork. This reminds me a lot of Dandara in terms of it being a high quality take on retro games. There‚Äôs an Easy mode and normal mode (which is really really challenging). I haven‚Äôt finished yet but I know I‚Äôm gonna want more levels by the end. Hopefully they make some more additions. Overall, highly recommend. "

Key word there: was. This game hasn't been updated since October, and that was only bug fixes. I unlocked all of the characters and trails months ago, but you guys haven't added any additional ones since launch. The game gets really boring without a reason to play, and missions would really help. Maybe you could only unlock certain characters/trails from completing missions. I mean, it's not like you're out of New characters to add. Off the top of my head, I could think of Bobert, Alan, and Miss Simian (since they're in the opening cutscene). Also add characters like Mr. Robinson, Mr. Small, Juke, Sarah, Tina Rex, Jamie, Teri, Clayton, Dr. Wrecker (Rob), Granny Jojo, Marvin, Larry, Hot Dog Guy,  and some variations for Nicole and Richard. Okay so I love the game and all but the characters are just not like gumball. They barely look like the characters! Also when penny fights, she turns purple. ITS REALLY WEIRD!! You could add characters like the egg heads or the lego guys too. I don't really think you watched the show because the fighting and reaction are nothing, and I mean NOTHING like the show. I watched every single episode and those things never happened. This game needs to be TAWOG-ified I love this game so much,it's well made and it's free,what's not to love about it? But I have one request, and I really,really hope that you devs will do it. I really want to play as Rob. Can you guys please make him available in this game.

It is a standard left to right action game with similarities / flavors of older titles such as Ghost House for the Sega Master System or Phantom Fighter for the NES. It involves moving from 1 starting location to the exit (Usually a door) to complete SED level. At which point you proceed to the next level. Action is carried out by shooting your enemies with a hand gun.Graphics:Since this is a port of an older J2me title it has that 16bit visual feel all over it. (one of the reasons I was sucked in to buy it) The graphics do the job of giving you that Splaterhouse or Ghost House feel but only lightly and do not make use of any parallax or multilayer scrolling that is usually found in almost all true older 16bit games of this type during the late 80's and early 90's. Frames of Animation are decent for what there is and horribly lacking for what there isn't. Your walking animations and gun firing animations are cute enough but there is absolutely NO jumping animation! Your character just begins to hover up and to the right or left, and then land. What...??? Even your enemies display a decent amount of frames when provoked or die, so why the lazy programming. (we will get to that later).Sound:I was actually surprised in this department! There seems to be 2 short eerie tunes that switch each level and last about 10 to 15 seconds in length before repeating. Not bad if you consider that this is an older J2me port. Most didn't have any music let alone sound effects unless it was from a major company like Gameloft or EA. Even the sound effects shocked me considering the source material. They had well sampled gun fire and death sound for the enemies and weapons.Control:This is where it all begins to fall apart and show how much effort (or lack there of) was put into this Iphone port. In the move from the J2me format where only 1 button press could be recognized at a time to the Iphone, nothing was changed! You still can only use one action button or movement button at a time. We are still in 2009 right? We didn't all take a step to the left and go through the time warp again did we? This to me along with the lack of animation and cut and paste jumping that reeks of early cell phone games in NO way justifies the $1.99 they are asking.Conclusion:I was sucked in by the decent 16bit ish looking art and theme. DO NOT GET SUCKED IN AS WELL BY THIS TRAP! This is a very BARE bones direct port of a really old J2me cell phone game that takes absolutely no advantage of the Iphone's capabilities! That coupled with a $1.99 asking price is pure madness in this APP market. If there was a .50 app selection I would still not recommend it. Another example of a company suckering the good people on the APP store out of their hard earned money! Contrary to what has been written, I like it. I LOVE the spooky music!!! It's cool adds a really nice touch!! It's playable. It's a platform game, I'm biased to platform games, there's not enough here in the app store, and the graphics could be better, but it's pretty fun. "

First of all, I would have given this game 5 stars without a second thought if not for an awful bug at the end of chapter 3. I cannot proceed past chapter 3 into chapter 4, whenever I press the continue button and try to, the game crashes. I have also tried clicking the chapters button and accessing it from there. The same thing happens, the entire game crashes. I really want to finish this game because it is so well made, unique, and compelling. So, I urge the developers etc. to please fix this bug as soon as possible. As well as another one I encountered in chapter 3. So, in chapter 3 Boris is supposed to open the door to Alice Angel. However, he got stuck and wouldn‚Äôt move at an open door a few feet away from the one he was supposed to fix. By using the elevator and going to random floors and coming back, I was able to fix it. But it was still very annoying so please fix that too. Otherwise, the game is great and would 10/10 recommend. Ok so first great game I beat all five chapters in like 2 hours I have been hoping that bendy would come to iPhone I have been watching markiplier and jacksepticeye play it Ever sense it was released back in 2017 and been a fan of it ever since also I loved that you put in your little meatly cameos and that jacksepticeye and DAgames had cameos to! But now on to the bug so when I played the game again I was in chapter three and I got the tommy gun and listened to Henry‚Äôs secret audio log and and I got to the end the elevator wouldn‚Äôt move and now I have to restart my game so if you can fix that that would be great well in the words of Wally franks I‚Äôm out of here! Ok so I know I mentioned the elevator a couple months ago and this is kinda a stupid question but I was wondering if you could make a setting in chapters 1 2 and 3 Ware we could switch it to the old chapters back to the remastered chapters I know you guys are working bendy and the dark revival but if you guys could do that that would be awesome sorry to bug you also are you guys making bendy and the dark revival for the switch play station Xbox and phone like this one? Sorry got excited when the trailer came out I love Bendy. Having been a fan since chapter 1 first came out, I was delighted to see a mobile version now that the game has been completed. However, there seems to be a bug in chapter 3. I‚Äôve tried to play it multiple times, but because the level is so big, I don‚Äôt have the time to complete it in one sitting. This is no problem in chapters 1 and 2, since I can save and exit the level/game. However, this doesn‚Äôt work in chapter 3. I exit the game fine, but when I try to play it from where I left off, I end up stuck in the elevator with none of the buttons working and the doors closed. When I look at the objective, it says to take the pipe, plunger, etc. But I‚Äôm already holding the item. I end up having to start a new game completely, and after three or four times of this, it gets very tiring. I love everything else about Bendy, and since these kind of bugs happen to even the best developers, I‚Äôve still decided to give the game 5 stars anyway. (though I would still love it if you fixed this bug) "

It takes so long it gets boring in my opinion, then you have guild battles and you can't never participate because the game doesn't load off the guilds who haven't been on in like 89 days. I've been trying to join or create a guild but it's not happening. Don't get me wrong this is a excellent game if you want time consumption but work more than one job you won't have much time at all. Plz fix these issues I greatly appreciate it. It has major potential if they get it right. If you can make a newer version with the camera right behind the player and more options than just one button too attack with staff you could charge for it plus fix these other issues my other players have complained about. Thanks a bunch. Since April 7th/8th 2020, I haven‚Äôt been able to get past the ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù portion of the loading screen on startup. I was hoping it was a quick fix on GL‚Äôs part. Checked the support page and did everything that they suggested (and more) to try and resolve the issue myself to no avail. I thought, ‚Äúalright, I‚Äôll submit a ticket to customer care and they‚Äôll fix it.‚Äù It‚Äôs nearly been a week now and I haven‚Äôt gotten an answer aside from the automated message that tells me to do the same things I‚Äôve already tried several times. I had purchased a few packs to help out with the (then) upcoming guild war and Easter egg hunt event; only to find that I can‚Äôt take part in either of them. I have to say I‚Äôm very disappointed and lost a lot of faith in Gameloft. I used to love so many of their mobile games but lately it just seems like they‚Äôre trying to rush out spotty updates to keep players on their toes and hopefully, to the developers, digging in their wallets. Normally I would rate this 4/5 stars, solely knocking one because of the p2w factor. However, with Gameloft seeming to CARE less about CUSTOMER CARE, I stand by my rating of 2/5 and would not recommend this, and many other of their games to anybody. A quick side note: I have read of many instances in online forums of this same issue happening multiple times through the past. You would think they could have sorted it out much more easily. There will never be a dungeon hunter game as good as the first 2 games, and they have been LONG gone and trapped in the past due to neglect. They were beautiful single player story driven games. I can‚Äôt even tell you the countless hours I‚Äôve spent in dungeon hunter 1, 2, and dungeon hunter alliance for the ps3 and psvita. Dungeon hunter 3 was okayyyyy but definitely a downgrade, then dungeon hunter 4 released. It was a combination of a good story driven single player experience with a multiplayer OPTION. And now you‚Äôve gone full circle with your latest releases. There are countless paywalls in the new games. I miss being able to just play a game. I can‚Äôt do that anymore. I have to PAY a game now. Hopefully you come to your senses and release a real game, but like most game companies/publishers nowadays, you probably never will. Its a shame, really. Dungeon hunter 2 is my favorite mobile game of all time. I played that game so much to the point where I memorized every single aspect of the game. (Glitches, chest locations, ways to do things more quickly and efficiently, farming locations) and there‚Äôs nothing fun about the new games anymore because none of those unique experiences are possible anymore.

You'll enjoy the game if this is your preference. Hoping to see improvements in an update :) "

Which is a very sad attempt to get people to play more. It‚Äôs really awful and I‚Äôm bringing it up to everyone who has the app. Also I think it gave my phone a ton of viruses because that she weren‚Äôt there before the app and randomly when you hit one of the red walls it might take an extra cube for no reason. ALSO DON‚ÄôT DO ANY OF THE UPDATES IF YOU HAVE THE APP. They only make it even worse. And just when you think you have a lot of cubes and it was a good round, there‚Äôs a huge pit or a bunch of barricades right at the very end that takes most of them away.

I tried restarting my phone, restarting the game, skipping the level, even deleting the game and getting it again- it doesn‚Äôt work!

I had to delete again. I tried again but it still wouldn‚Äôt work! I‚Äôve seen other reviews saying the exact same thing from months ago and it still hasn‚Äôt improved? That just shows that no one at the company cares. I‚Äôm really annoyed! Also, even though you can still play the levels, the other levels so far have also been glitchy! The skip level button doesn‚Äôt even work. There are ads every level and they are all 30 or 45 seconds long. I had to turn off my WiFi the ads got so bad! What really is annoying is usually I am pretty flexible with glitches. But when it gets so bad that you can‚Äôt play the game? I can‚Äôt just ignore that! Also, your ad shows that the game is not glitchy at all but seriously? If you‚Äôre not gonna fix the game then make the ads match the game! Augh!

I‚Äôve never had a game crash on me this often. Often it‚Äôll crash after playing an ad. It crashed on me just now mid-level, and this is after the game crashed so badly that I had to reinstall it and lose all my progress just to get it to work again. It‚Äôs a testament to how good the game is that I did reinstall it. It‚Äôs challenging, fun and aesthetically pleasing. You can earn many cosmetic bonuses just through gameplay and by patiently watching advertisements. You needn‚Äôt support the game financially unless you really want to, and that‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs got a great sense of whimsy to it, and I‚Äôm very fond of the little avatar I‚Äôve selected. I‚Äôm really enjoying it.If they can just patch out that horrible crash bug, they‚Äôd earn that fifth star from me. Sure, I have an iPhone 7, which probably does affect how the game runs, but a good game should run smoothly on all compatible devices, not just newer ones. Please, Lucky Kat, fix this issue! This game‚Äôs too good to have a fatal error like this! This game has a lot of charm. I love the collection aspect of the game and how you can easily get new upgrades throughout the game just by passing through levels discounting the ones which cost coins. Some suggestions I have for the game is to add way more plants to the game. I find them far more appealing than the pots but there are so few. The gameplay could also be enhanced with projectiles which destroy your vine, trampolines, or spike traps, as well as other power ups and a time limit for each level which ticks down (earning more coins for completing a level fast enough). Anything to make the game more risky. It would also be nice if you get a coin reward for how long your vine is. Lastly there should be a endless mode to achieve highs scores which includes far more enemies and dangers. The game as it is is not too challenging to progress unless your trying to collect every piece of food or destroy every enemy. All in all it‚Äôs a beautiful game that I highly recommend to anyone. Look, I absolutely adore this game. It has it all, the cute graphics, the great game physics, the mechanics, everything about it is great except the ads. I understand that as the developers, you have to make money. But, it becomes extreme when in order to plant your seeds to collect more plants in the game you have to watch an ad. EVERY TIME. Some people can not afford to watch that many ads because they do not have unlimited or any phone data nor do they have access to the internet. I just wanted to let you know that making someone watch an ad EVERY TIME YOU GET A SEED FOR A PLANT is not the best way to go for getting people to watch them. Instead, the ad for the plant pots, brilliant you should definitely keep that, and you could maybe have a picture ad pop up every three or so levels/deaths. Just a suggestion from an exasperated player who loves this game. "

I see my review from wayyy back is still on the poster for this game to sucker in players. While in some ways this is still one of the closest to the original 8 pages game, in terms of graphics and such, the game desperately needs to return to its roots with earlier versions. The sheer number of ads that bombard the player takes away from the excitement, and its annoying how often they pop up on both the menu and everytime the player dies it asks if youd like to see an ad to continue. The life bar at the top is another thing that needs to go. Part of the fear factor in playing this is in not knowing when or if slenderman would get you. The depletion of the bar is a giveaway that your about to die and coupled with the fact that slenderman makes you look at him, its also cheap. Keep the face cam and everyplay record and share features however. Its cool to be able to let others see your replays. The new levels are good add ons as well. While i can take or leave the slender coin feature, some of the features you can get with them (night vision additional levels and a page finder) are cool. Keep these but do away with continues. In short, Return this game to being more like past versions from 4 or so years ago and perhaps keep the share features. Its annoying as hell to play as is. So... what makes good horror games? The answer is kind of complicated, and since this is really a simple game I will shorten the list. First off: atmosphere! The dark forest and sounds really set off a good place to die. Humans are social beings, and being alone is one of our major weaknesses, and Slender takes advantage of that. While this game is really difficult it is possible. The more pages you collect, the more aggresive Slender gets, following right behind your every step. Tension is also a big factor: you see the page, and get a rush of elation. But you see a gaunt face peeking out of the trees. Just the fact that you have to get the pages, but Slender might already be their makes it kinda creepy.While the game to play is not very scary (the enclosed ones like warehouse are creepier because sometimes you have to turn around and Slender might be there) sometimes it really gets your heart pounding. For me, the scariest part is whenever you are home in the dark, you remember this game, and don't want to move. However, it is much like Slender on the PC. The controls can be a little iffy at times, but it adds to the 'oh god' element of horror.ENJOY! "

Plus there is a level that you can make of your own and share it with your friends see if they can pass the level. You also don‚Äôt have to do the level one you can skip a level and do the easy and fun action in it. What is also good about this game is that you can probably download on other devices or consoles and don‚Äôt have to upgrade or update the game so you can save your data on the console or device. You don‚Äôt have to keep raging just because there is no internet Happy Wheels doesn‚Äôt need internet so you can play offline anytime anywhere. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about happy wheels is that there are only a couple of characters and can‚Äôt play ‚ÄúCOMING SOON‚Äù characters so it does need some updates also you can only play ‚ÄúCOMING SOON‚Äù characters whenever are making your own level to share with your friends. So whoever made this game please add more characters and let us play ‚ÄúCOMING SOON‚Äù characters in original levels...thank youüëå I personally find this game great, and it‚Äôs really fun. I‚Äôd be on my phone 24/7 playing this game if it wasn‚Äôt for the ads. Every 6 tries or so, you get an ad, which you can skip 5 seconds in, only to wait another 12 seconds while they show it to you as a preview from the App Store. And if you don‚Äôt have Internet, they still make you wait 10 seconds while they show you a blue screen showing the timer. But in that case, you get an ad every time you go to another level, and that is simply too much.Another really bad thing about this game is the frequency of updates and new added levels. It‚Äôs been forever since I‚Äôve been waiting for the levels for pogo stick guy and the couple, but I think the developers forgot about that completely and that‚Äôs honestly a bummer. They could‚Äôve nominated levels created by other people as the levels made for those two characters, all while adding more building features for fan-made levels.The final thing that made me change my 5-star rating down to 2 is the inability to play/explore other people‚Äôs levels. This feature would‚Äôve kept me on this game nonstop, just exploring other people‚Äôs creations and messing around with them. I love this game, and I also can play this on my computer, but it‚Äôs easier on my iPad, and my computer can‚Äôt handle playing happy wheels, it‚Äôs usually laggy. But mobile doesn‚Äôt have any updates, new characters, or the search tab for levels. I‚Äôm giving this game a 4 star review, because it‚Äôs not completed, and I don‚Äôt think it ever will be. This game hasn‚Äôt been updated for 2 or more years. I‚Äôm also really confused, because in the level creator, we don‚Äôt have half of the other items that people on computers have. And we can‚Äôt do any levels on other characters because it says ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù even though they‚Äôve never come yet. But in the level creator, we can play with the characters that are ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù in the level list. I really think this game needs some updates. Other than that, it‚Äôs a good game, and if anyone wants to get happy wheels because they can‚Äôt play on a computer, then you can get this game. It‚Äôs still fun either way. "

Very creative selection of devices, more than I‚Äôve seen anywhere.  Please make more weapons & it would be cool to have scream sounds to toggle on and off. This game is pretty decent, decent supply of weapons and okay animation, but feels lacking. A lot of people are saying this is a ripoff of Buddy but based off what I‚Äôve seen with the chained doll and the weapons, it seems more like a Smash Dude rip-off, but with less flavor and overall just more bland and boring. Overall decent game but if your looking for something similar with a larger inventory and just more more in general, I suggest Smash Dude. But overall decent game, if there was a larger inventory and just overall a bit more (facial features and more movement for example), then this would definitely be a better game. "
‚ÄéJet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum,"NEWS FLASH! - the Manic Miner¬Æ app - a perfectly formed replica of the much-loved home computer game, with 3D voxel-style graphics - AVAILABLE NOW Search the App Store for ‚Äúthe Manic Miner¬Æ app‚Äù. IMPORTANT: To 'Save' the game go 'Back' to the Main Menu before quitting the App. Jet Set Willy for the ZX Spectrum (an 8-bit personal home computer released in the UK in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd, which sold in excess of 5 million units worldwide) is one of THE defining games of the 1980s. Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is offered as an in-app purchase from within the Recreated ZX Spectrum app. The Recreated ZX Spectrum app includes more ZX Spectrum games plus Sinclair BASIC. Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other ZX Spectrum games but it does include an infinite-lives version. Jet Set Willy: ZX Spectrum is the 100% original ZX Spectrum game, written in 1984 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our ZX Spectrum: Elite Collection technology. Featuring: - portrait and landscape play / display modes - iDaptive (user-definable, game-specific joystick, keypad & canvas) Controls - ‚Äòauto save‚Äô, on exiting the game - authentic 'Spectrum' sound Jet Set Willy was published in 1984 by Software Projects. The game is a sequel to Manic Miner (1983), and is the second game in the immensely popular Miner Willy Series. The Plot: A tired Miner Willy  has to tidy up all the items left around his house after a huge party. With this done his housekeeper Maria will allow him access to his bedroom. Willy's mansion was bought with the wealth obtained from his adventures in Manic Miner  but much of it remains unexplored and it appears to be full of strange creatures, possibly a result of the previous (missing) owner's experiments. Willy must explore the enormous mansion and its grounds (including a beach and a yacht) to fully tidy up the house so he can get some much-needed sleep. Game-play: Willy moves from room to room in his mansion collecting objects. Unlike the screen-by-screen style of its prequel, the player can explore the mansion at will and tackle the screens in the order of their choosing. Willy is controlled using only left, right and jump. He can climb stairs by walking into them (jumping through them to avoid them) and climb swinging ropes by pushing left or right depending on what direction the rope is swinging in. The play area itself consists of 60 flick-screen  making-up the mansion and its grounds and containing hazards (static killer objects), patrolling monsters (killer guardians which move along predetermined paths), various platforms and collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other items in the room. Willy loses a life if he touches an enemy or falls too far, and he is returned to the point at which he entered the room. This may lead to a game-ending situation in which Willy repeatedly falls from a height, losing all lives in succession. Bugs: As originally released, the game could not be completed due to several bugs. Although actually four completely unrelated issues, they became known collectively as ""The Attic Bug"". After the player entered the room The Attic, various rooms would undergo corruption on all subsequent game plays, including all monsters disappearing from The Chapel, and other screens triggering instant death. Initially Software Projects attempted to pass off this bug off as an intentional feature to make the game more difficult, claiming that the rooms in question were filled with poison gas. However, they later rescinded this claim and issued a set of POKEs to correct the flaws.

Build a dungeon full of lethal traps and priceless gems, then raid other players‚Äô lairs and amass a fortune. Cuddly characters and a playful atmosphere provide the perfect counterpoint for tricky scenarios requiring skill, strategy, and cunning. This is a great game, but like I said in the title, there are a few things that I don‚Äôt like. Four things. One, I don‚Äôt like it that you have to complete your dungeon two times in a row to save. I understand that you made that concept to prevent players from making impossible stages, but I feel like you don‚Äôt need to complete it two times in a row to show that it‚Äôs not impossible.Two, I really don‚Äôt like how sometimes when someone steals your gem, you can‚Äôt get revenge if they are online. Yesterday I got my most valuable gem stolen and I had to wait for today to try to get it back JUST BECAUSE HE WAS ONLINE. That brings me to my third thing. I find it really annoying that if your gemstone isn‚Äôt on the totem of the person who stole from you, you can‚Äôt get it even when you complete their dungeon. It‚Äôs really annoying and since you can‚Äôt get two revenges, you have to really on your clan mates, or hope that you just happen to find that exact person‚Äôs dungeon and that he has your gemstone on his totem. Since my most valuable gem was stolen, I completed his dungeon, but since my gemstone wasn‚Äôt on there, I couldn‚Äôt get. Fourth, could you remove the aspect that once you die a lot of times it automatically disables one of the traps. It‚Äôs really annoying that you can get your gem stolen just because of that aspect. I think that is they want to disable a trap, it has to come from their own storage. I HATE the Christmas update. It was good before. Please tell me it‚Äôll go back to normal soon! I didn‚Äôt even wanna update, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me play until I did, and it wouldn‚Äôt even let me update for a few days, so I wasn‚Äôt able to play and a bunch of my gold and one of my gems got stolen and I couldn‚Äôt do anything and the stupid raiding houses through chimneys got me to blow all my orbs avoiding the red guards and I ran out I didn‚Äôt get any treasure how could anyone get through all 25 houses anyway? And they shuffle the presents and I thought that it was like following the cups with your eyes and choosing which one had the ball but no it was just random and also a while back you got rid of the option to report some dungeons as impossible because there are some seriously sketchy ones and I am NOT just saying that out of spite I would try to check the dungeon solution for those when I gave up and the game would disconnect that also happens a lot when I‚Äôm trying to retrieve guild members gems I would be on, like, my 20th try and just when I‚Äôm about to get close the frickin‚Äô thing disconnects and it counts it as a failure Also traps for new dungeons and upgrading traps is way too expensive and they‚Äôre not even that good AAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH.              okay, I‚Äôm calm now. Just fix this stuff. PLEASE. Oop, some guy named Gorjo just raided me. üòëüòíüòû "

I spend about 5 hours a day playing this game. Its very addictive, my big and lil brother play it to. I really enjoy the game and hope everyone else rates 5 stars! And no, I want NOTHING to change :). And if you suggest something, it‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt really like the game. Please don‚Äôt change the game. I extremely enjoy it and I hope you all do to! This is a very very addictive game with a short review. I just hope it stays the same forever. If it‚Äôs banned, I‚Äôll be devastated. Tysm for reading this! :) I think, I KNOW this game is 5 stars, but there is one small problem that if fixed, wouldn‚Äôt make me think twice about rating 5 stars. Sometimes when I‚Äôm in the leaderboard like 1st or 2nd place and I‚Äôm not dying to other snakes, the game just glitches me out and kills me FOR NO REASON. I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch or a really small snake spawning in front of me, but either way find a way to fix it. Now I‚Äôm not saying this happens to often, but I‚Äôm saying it happens when your really big and when you‚Äôve been playing for a while in the top of the leaderboard. Other than that great game! Does anyone know what the GREEN CIRCLE potion is for????I've been glued to the game the second i DL it, and even gotten friends and family stuck on it! There is a couple annoying things though. Like it doesn't matter how high your score is, the points to level up don't roll over so you have to keep killing yourself for the points to count üò£. I can live with that but what really makes me crazy is YOU GUYS NEED TO PUT IN A PAUSE BUTTON!! I played for 5 1/2 hours once and had to keep asking for help playing if I needed to get up to do something! Fix those things and I'll give it 5 stars!! Some extra faces, skins and ability to customize the special skins would be awesome too!! Hi there! Wow that is so impressive! I guess it's been a while and we've had many upgrades since then - you should check it out. However, the pause button hasn't been released yet. We will definitely take it into consideration.  "

We found ourselves gawking at reflections, lens flare, and scenery as we motored through hairpin turns at breakneck speeds. The improvements aren't just cosmetic, though‚Äîyou'll find yourself stunned by the believable roars of engines and the huge variety of true-to-life cars and courses. RR3 also packs great new gameplay features like Time Shifted Multiplayer, which allows us to race asynchronously against friends in fierce tests of driving prowess. I‚Äôve been playing for over a year and a half now. I was playing consistently for the first 6 months without ever having to spend real money. Then once I got to ‚ÄúDriver Level‚Äù 170, I slowed down on my playing as I wasn‚Äôt able to progress at a fast rate without having to spend real money. I would play only the daily bonus then go play another racing app. I started racing more consistently when RR3 finally added the first 2 Honda‚Äôs on an update, as I‚Äôm a Honda fan. So ever since then I‚Äôm now a ‚ÄúDriver Level‚Äù 265 with 226 cars in my garage. And I‚Äôve been spending real money in order to progress and collect more cars to my collection. I only spend real money on sales and discounts. I keep my R$, M$ and GC in top amounts so I can continue to progress. So many complaints about RR3 having to spend real money in order to progress, kinda true but only if you want to progress in a faster rate. You can progress without spending real money, but just at a slower rate and people don‚Äôt get that. At the time I slowed down playing RR3 because I didn‚Äôt want to spend real money, I tried out other racing apps and nothing compares to RR3! RR3 has the most cars ever in an app game. So I don‚Äôt mind spending real money in order to progress at a faster rate, plus my goal now is to collect every car available. Thanks RR3 for an amazing app game, but please try to add my own car ‚Äú2012 Honda Civic SI‚Äù and a current ‚ÄúHonda Civic SI‚Äù. I‚Äôd love to drive my car on here! Okay so I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time sents I was in 4th grade so there‚Äôs some things you need to take away and add in the game..... first of all you need to add a Free ride, so with that free ride we can chose our map and chose that cars that we own and want to drive on that map, Second the cars, some of the cars are really cool but dosent need to be so expensive like the Nissan GTR Premium was like I think over 57,000 dollars and then the price what bumped up to 200,000 something, Third the money I‚Äôm not saying that the money is great but it just need to be bumped up a lil bit for me idk about anyone else but the money needs to be bumped up like 15,000 something Fourth the crowd can be moving and all but like they need to cheer some more and the louder the better. The graphics are amazing I love how it looks but anyway The Fifth is the Service can you bump this service down for like each race car Bc sometimes I need my race cars and I need them to race cuh like one of my cars are higher than the other ones so yea and that‚Äôs all so I hope you can add a free ride to the game and we can chose our own cars for the free ride and so yea hope you can change some stuff in the future the game is amazing I play it everyday and I am a fan and a supporter for Real Racing 3 "

For example, I think the concept of teaching your robot on the design screen is nice, but I think it is a little too much when actually using it in-game. Because if your just messing around with the robot, it actually creates a sort of back up that it uses if you do not input a movement to the robot, while I like how the game gives you the choice of making a backup, I think they should have made it a a bit more specific.I think they *may* have added a *bit* too many ads in between games, but that‚Äôs just my opinion, because if your the type of person who likes to watch ads, that‚Äôs totally fine. But now to the actual gameplay, I feel that it could be a little more                 ‚Äúless random‚Äù. What I mean is that whenever you input a movement, the robot just kind of do us it‚Äôs own thing, so the movement could be a bit more calculated.But in the end, despite having some flaws left and right. It‚Äôs a fun game about robots and destruction. Maybe it‚Äôs meant to be random so it‚Äôs kinda frustrating. But what do I know? I‚Äôm not a game designer. Ok so don‚Äôt get me wrong this game is great and deserves a lot of attention I don‚Äôt want anyone to take this as criticism but more of a suggestion, you see the game is great and fun but it‚Äôs not really balanced. What I mean is that when you fight you can go through slot of easy to kill enemies but there‚Äôs been a couple times where on enemy is just to much and I have to wait for it to reset just so I can get a new enemy I hope that someone can fix this, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs intentional or not but I feel as if it should be fixed because it‚Äôs ridiculous how sometimes it‚Äôll just give you an overpowered enemy and you can‚Äôt get unlock that item because of that one enemy... Game starts outs great. Love the concept. Somehow was 1st place for the contests. So I made another account on my other phone... didn‚Äôt see my main account at the number 1 spot. Whatever. Now, it seems like I‚Äôm facing a lot of the same players. No matter what type of match I play. High and low costing games. There‚Äôs one in particular that‚Äôs a robot w/ nothing but the stinger that barley moves so that you just lose. Literally takes no effort. A lot of those and other similar robots that I can‚Äôt get around. It‚Äôs like the 3 same presets for different scenarios. I have to get lucky and switch presets last second to hopefully screw them over. But even then... they still just seem unfair and a little too fortunate at times.It‚Äôs still pretty fun. But as I progress and get less parts I actually find useful or beneficial; the more I face these same exact presets. Like literally somehow the same movements as if these aren‚Äôt real players. "

There‚Äôs always something new, and literal years of gameplay for the casual player. There‚Äôs nothing pay to win about this game, and the option to pay is (in my opinion) worth it. I have unlocked all of the characters (about $10 for all of them) and am happy with my decision. This game is better then some games for consoles I‚Äôve played, and even without paying its one of the best. Those ten dollars is like buying a console or pc tier game for much cheaper then a pc game that‚Äôs as good. There‚Äôs limitless possibilities and limitless playtime, regardless if you have cash to burn or not. It‚Äôs a simple and fun experience playing the game. It starts out extremely hard, but as you play more, you soon win easily. The hundreds of weapons keep the game interesting every time you play, and can make awesome combos. This game is 100% worth downloading and I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone. Much love to the devs and thank you for what‚Äôs possibly the greatest mobile game I‚Äôll ever have the experience of playing.The one thing I do want is better iOS support and better cloud saves, but other then that, this is an amazing game, and the saves don‚Äôt tarnish it at all. From near the beginning to where it is now, this game has had a stellar performance. There is a massive arsenal of weaponry that is extremely creative and fun to use again and again. The different enemies and maps keeps the game fresh, and the new challenges adds that hint of flavor to the mix. The characters, statues, and buffs are exciting to play with and the synergy that can be achieved is amazing. Every new feature added to Soul Knight, from the reforging furnace to the workshop, has improved the quality immensely.    Aside from gameplay the controls are easy to use and it‚Äôs smooth, although there are some infrequent bumps along the way. The multiplayer aspect just makes the game twice as fun to play, but glitches do occur. For instance, when one player uses the reforging furnace the other cannot pick up the weapon that is produced, even though it‚Äôs visible.    I have no problems with this game whatsoever, and I hope that it continues to grow even greater over time. Even from the hardships of getting terrible buffs & fighting with a plunger, to the exhilarating moments of a perfect play through, Soul Knight will be one of the best games to have ever been created. This is an absolute blast. When you first start the game it will seem rather difficult and frustrating but once you beat your first run it‚Äôs all up hill from there. This isn‚Äôt a pay-to-play kind of game. There are certain characters and things in the game to enhance your gameplay which you do have to pay for but it‚Äôs not necessary to enjoy the game. Now the reason I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 is the cloud save. Three times now I have lost my data. As soon as your done playing for the day make sure you cloud save. The first two times it was when the game first came out and it would bug out so my data would wipe. The recent time I have lost my data though I had over 100 hours into the game; almost 2 years of gameplay gone. I had all the free characters unlocked, fully upgraded, and a ton of resources. I went to open up the app and it would crash as soon as I did. A week later they updated the game and all my data was wiped. I went to the cloud save to get my data back and all that was there was data I had in the first few months of me playing. I love this game but after working so hard to get to where I was and losing it all it‚Äôs bittersweet to get back into the grind of the game to get to back to where I was. "

I think the developers had as much fun coming up with all the cat puns as they did the exciting and engaging story. The side quests were all spunky and enjoyable, the world was very well laid out with increasing difficulty as you headed north, causing you to pause and enjoy getting stronger in each location before rushing headlong into the next area. I loved the diversity of equipment and powers and really found a simple pleasure in the attack/retreat pattern of fighting enemies. I loved all the secrets and mysteries hidden throughout the land and once (no spoilers here) a certain ability was unlocked, I couldn‚Äôt wait to search the whole world to its fullest. Great job guys, I enjoyed the game very much!P.S. I‚Äôm so sad to see you added Cat Quest 2 to the Apple Arcade roster which means I will never get to enjoy it due to my refusal to sign up for a membership to play games occasionally on my phone. I don‚Äôt believe in subscriptions and I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea. I would love to pay a flat price and enjoy your sequel, but as it stands I guess number one will have to live forever in my memory as the pleasant and only Cat Quest to me. Cat Quest is very fun and addicting - just a couple changes I would like.When you go into the area to see your weapons, armor and spells you tap on the icon in the bottom left. Then to exit you click on an icon in the upper left. I would love for the exit icon to ‚Äîalways‚Äî be in the same place as the icon to get into anything.I would like more control of how far I zoom out. And I would like to be able to tap somewhere and have kitty cat start walking to that place with the zoom zooming back in on where the cat is. Also on zooming. I would love to be able to tap with two fingers anytime I‚Äôm zoomed out and have it zoom back in for me instead of tapping on an icon. You can add it as part of the training at one of the monuments. Either tap on the icon or double-tab anywhere to unzoom. Or even double-tap to zoom out and then double-tap to zoom back in.Oh, and I would love to be able to put my own X somewhere. I could then tap on that X later with a note about that place. Like that place where you walk through the water to the chest that is off screen? Not everyone will remember where that is after you finally find the key. I‚Äôve spent a few hours playing the game and been all over and haven‚Äôt found the key yet.I would also like to be able tap on the stats for each item so that it can tell me exactly what it refers to. Like 6/6 = six of what and six of what? The game cant really stand on its own ... its not engaging enough to hold your full attention - its more of a mindless game you would play while watching a movie or on a long car ride. Customization is key for a good RPG game and this game offers very little. You get stronger gear from chests & quests, basically you'll get 3 sets - tank, mage or DPS. There is no kind of enhancement or crafting system. Skills are boring too - you pay gold to increase their damage aaaand that's it. I'd say this game would be good for ages 13 and under ... older and you probably wont be too impressed. Due to its simplicity, i believe a 5 year old could easily beat this game. I would say i got my 5 bucks worth as far as the amount of time ive sunk into the game. The 3-star rating is because it's not a great match for me personally, but I would recommend it for casual players and a younger audience. It is a well polished game, my experience has been bug-free and never had even a single crash. There is a foundation here for a 5-star game - as it is, it is generic, lacking in features and any kind of originality to make it a memorable experience. Hoping the developers will give this game a bit more love. "

Please fix this I love playing this game with my best friend but when I getting ripped up by people that aren‚Äôt actually skilled and they pay to win I get so angry because you can‚Äôt do anything about it. Thank you for your kind words and critics as well. We will improve our matchmaking so that not paying users don't feel that bad about the game. If you have screenshots of unbalanced match and rating, win rate % information, please let us know, this will help improving. support@panzerdog.com I urge devs to read this because I‚Äôll be including ideas for next update. I really enjoy this game and play with my brother every so often. I do have problems with it such as the unbalanced part when playing with guys who spent money on the game but I understand it‚Äôs pay to win. I would like to see some new maps such as the ‚ÄúDo not‚Äù map seen in images and the one with the choppers. New vehicles such as choppers added to much larger maps if the game could run it would be great. Attachments and different time set maps would be cool such as  night maps where flashlights are good. Seeing a PvE mode like zombies or even a coop story mode would be interesting. (I want to point out I don‚Äôt expect any of these to come out soon or ever but would throughly enjoy them in the future). I enjoy the new game mode you added but I barely get that one chosen. Maybe adding a select game mode option would be nice after more are implemented. Add a repair tool or wrench to fix destroyed cars. I noticed that when someone leaves the game, an A.I. Continues to play for you or the other person which allows for unbalanced matches which is bad. Either remove the person entirely or don‚Äôt allow leaving. Allow vehicles to survive longer but make the occupants weaker while in said vehicle. But most importantly, keep doing what you guys are doing because you have created a really good game that is so addicting that even when you lose you want to play again just to feel better. Ill start off by saying that I love this game. It‚Äôs action packed and has some interesting mechanics. My only complaint is being able to acquire coins in a decent amount of time is near impossible without spending hours playing daily or just spending real money. Some weapons you can earn coins per kill but I think that should be a feature with every gun, just more coins per kill for the more premium and higher tier weapons. We should at least get coins for winning instead of hoping for the random bonus spin which gives you a negligible amount of coins and none of the gold coins or doing ‚Äúgoals‚Äù that pay 30 coins. There should be a base bonus for winning in each rank. Realistically I can only spend my coins upgrading one weapon to even compete at my rank. Or I have to purposely lose A LOT of matches to get people of similar skill and weapon tier. That also makes some of the missions insanely hard to complete. Even if its just 100 coins per win and 5-20 coins per kill depending on weapon MK lvl I‚Äôd play more than once a week. Again great game, its just hard to stay interested when it‚Äôs so time consuming to save up for just one weapon upgrade that gives mild improvements for us broke people not willing to pay to win.

So far lots of fun and actually has somewhat of a choice system in which you decide how the future will be. However there are a few issues I do have. One is the glitch where if you dash at a wall sometimes you will get stuck and the enemies will absolutely obliterate you if you don‚Äôt know the exact why to get out. Another is the weapon balancing, now I understand that the weapons are preference and get stronger over time however the cultless sword is the best starting sword to have as the added range beats any other light weapon in the game, the double edge is pretty good too. But the mace is really bad and needs a buff. I would also love to see like frequent updates so we can grow this world! Great job so far. What I love about this game is it doesn‚Äôt punish you for getting killed, you actually get some buffs and perks. With this said you will most likely die a lot if your not that good at fast mostly up close games like I. It took me like 5 tries to kill Dracula‚Äôs hound, and after killing him the levels only get harder it seems if you get hit once your dead. When I finally got to the Dracula level I didn‚Äôt even make it to him before I died. At that point i was a little annoyed going through the seemingly same decisions and levels all just to die and do it again, a real ground hog day feel. But if you have the time or are bored and just want to mess some enemies up as a vampire go for it. One thing I would like is a OST, I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for it, specially the final Dracula stage music which sounds sick. In a crowded mobile space, Immortal Rogue really stands out. Rather than just surface-level, mindless clicking, it brings impressive polish, unique mechanics, interesting premise, and a fun, replay-worthy formula to the table. The combat is fun and easy to learn, and the game offers a progressive challenge for those who are up to it. What‚Äôs really nice about Immortal Rogue is that you can pick it up and play for a couple minutes, or stick to it for a few hours. Either way, you‚Äôre getting a satisfying, rewarding experience. The added layers of the time-traveling story, upgradable abilities and weapons, and changing environments really gives it a fresh, addictive quality every time you jump back in. This one‚Äôs a winner and should be played by anyone who loves an original, well-made game‚Äîlooking forward to how many years I can make it on my next run through time. "

Also if you collect everything and you are dying you can simply use the carrots and start exactly where you just made a mistake, I‚Äôve never been placed in a look of me ‚Äúdying‚Äù also they have a place where you just watch ads and it keeps re spawning you where you left off Incase you don‚Äôt have carrots it has also never crashed for me 10/10 This is the first time that I‚Äôve rated something, and yet I have a lot to say. The sprite work is phenomenal and the game doesn‚Äôt lag, which is nice. The levels are well made, but sometimes I go one way, thinking that it‚Äôs a bonus area, but then I see the end, and I can‚Äôt bump into a wall to turn around. Maybe put a small telltale sign that casual players won‚Äôt notice? Anyways, that isn‚Äôt a huge deal, but there are a few that I need to address. First off, ads. The ads are constant, and they happen after every death, restart, and level select. It‚Äôs nice that the devs added a ‚ÄòNo Ads‚Äô purchase, but I‚Äôm not paying three dollars for it. Maybe .99? I don‚Äôt know. Second, the controls. The one-hand gameplay style is convenient, but the fact that you have to bump into a wall to turn around is annoying. I think it would be better to swipe one way or another to turn. I know that‚Äôs a pretty big gameplay change, but I certainly think it would improve the game. And lastly, the death mechanism. It‚Äôs annoying to almost finish a stage, but then mistime a jump and fall into the water. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Mario games, so maybe add a power-up mushroom, or an Extra Life token as a bonus. So all in all, it‚Äôs a good game. Is it my favorite? No. Is it my least favorite? No. If you like short platforming adventures, download it. But just don‚Äôt get to happy, because there are some downsides. That‚Äôs really it. The game starts out really fun and it‚Äôs easy to collect items. It‚Äôs especially interesting to explore all the different paths in the levels. The speed is quite jarring, and it isn‚Äôt something I got used to, especially when this + the point of view makes you run into enemies you don‚Äôt see coming half the time. But the mechanic of not being able to change direction until you hit a wall gets very annoying VERY fast. The levels also become crazy hard way too soon and depending on where and when you spawn, you may get stuck in a loop of dying over and over because there isn‚Äôt anything you can do to avoid it. The game also tends to crash in the middle of levels (without saving your progress, of course), so there‚Äôs that. All these things added up very quickly and made this cute game unenjoyable for me, and I ended up just deleting the app in the middle level 12. Why would I spend my time on something that‚Äôs just going to raise my blood pressure because of things I can‚Äôt control? "

Slow Katz: you just talk to captain kallio skipping everything as fast as you could and just go out and see the snowstorm and somehow  just randomly the game just gets slow right after something fast.  2.floating Katz: I have no idea about how this glitch happened but somehow in return to the swamp, the cat just sinks into the ground when on the ground but when you press left or right fast enough, the cat just floats. Even if you change the cat you still float. 3. Freezing Katz: just so you know, the ‚Äò‚Äôfreezing‚Äô‚Äô meant like the game soft locked. I know how to do this glitch!!! In Kaze towers, when you go to the door that leads to the place where there is this someone who gives the key to the sky labyrinth, okay, so you just go there, look at the door, equip the balloon item, float, and when the balloon pops, hold left until you land and the game. just. soft locks. I downloaded the game on the AppStore and to undo the glitches, just restart the app (don‚Äôt delete it)!Fun fact:Did you know that in the super cat tales timeline, Super cat tales 2 is actually before the first? Watch the video ‚Äúsuper cat tales timeline‚Äù for more info. Please just go with Shriyans instead of Shriyansp8. A lot of love went into this game and you can tell. The story actually has some dept for a side scrolling mobile game. Though this game does have some caveats for any non gamers looking for a game similar to Mario or Kirby. 1. Coin grinding. Unless you're willing to spend $10, collecting the right amount of coins is going to feel like a chore. You‚Äôd have to repeatedly replay a specific level more than 50 times to grind for coins to proceed in the game. Personally I think this creator is worth the $10 but if you can‚Äôt pay then prepare for repeating 2-4.2. YOU ARE GOING DIE over and over and over again. Not going to lie, this game is going to be frustrating because sheer amount of death you‚Äôll experience. Some deaths are permanent, some are due to monkeys, and some are due to impatience. You‚Äôd either have to be patient or play better, you‚Äôre stilling going to die a bunch though.3. Platforming in the later stages becomes unnecessarily difficult. If you want to beat the game, you gotta work on your platforming during this game. You don‚Äôt get punished in early stages but once you get to world 7.. oof TLDR: It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows in this cute kitty cat game. Be prepared for fun, rage, tears, and lots of death. Seriously.. you‚Äôll die.. a lot.. I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but when I played this game, I knew I had to. I love how you can switch cats on the fly, something cat tales 1 didn‚Äôt let you do. The mechanic is so overused yet in this game it seems so original. All cats play pretty distinctly and have their own abilities. When I first picked up the game I thought it was going to be simple, joystick controls. When I loaded the first level, and saw the controls which are very hard to describe other than weird, I thought of deleting the game. But after the third level I had gotten used to it and the controls were pretty easy to understand. This is a game with unusual controls but nevertheless is easy to control. I‚Äôve seen reviews with people saying the controls are broken, to them, I say try harder.The soundtrack astonished me at first because I‚Äôve never really played a mobile game with such a good soundtrack. So play this game for yourself and enjoy everything this game has to offer.

Even though there‚Äôs not a huge variety in the cycling of the available ‚Äúcourses‚Äù it does help learn how to best play the level. If they added even 10 more courses it would give a better variety. After you‚Äôve reached about level 30 (which isn‚Äôt a terribly difficult thing to do) there‚Äôs nothing else to earn. It simply becomes leveling up. The only rewards are different style pieces. However even though you can‚Äôt earn any more rewards, when you level up it still says to ‚Äúclaim reward‚Äù and automatically changes your pieces to the last ones you earned. This then means that you either have to be constantly changing the pieces to the ones you want or you simply have to stay with what they put you on. The last thing that seems like a glitch is that you don‚Äôt always get your sized up pieces for the next round of a match. There have been times that I‚Äôve had two knights at the end of the round and either had none or only one starting off the next round. Or that I‚Äôve had a bishop at the end of the round but was only given a knight for the next round. If these couple of glitches were fixed and there was more to earn once you get further in the game this would be a fantastic game. Otherwise it‚Äôs still a pretty good game. I think it's a great concept. I love the game. There's a glitch when you get to bonus rounds though. If you get all the stars you get 350. It asks you to watch a video to double up. Every time I try to double up and watch the whole video, it will glitch out and my score will start at zero and then add up to where it basically gives me the 350 I would have gotten without watching the video. ALSO, you really need too design a way to show what each playing piece is worth at each level it is. I shouldn't have to watch at the end and write down what each one is worth. Maybe even a tree graph to show what it takes to get from a basic pawn to upgraded queen would be cool too. I still enjoy the game very much and I love the whole idea of it 4/5 from me until there's some issues fixed. Thanks y'all, keep up the good workü§üüèΩ This game glitches literally every single level. It is always one of two, technically three glitches. The first glitch is that the game momentarily freezes, briefly before crashing, wiping all progress from your current level. The other glitch is that the game zooms out so far that you cannot even see the red and blue of the pieces whatsoever. Hand in hand with the second glitch, it also zooms in all the way so that all you see is the solid color of the platform that the pieces are on, forcing you to close the game out, DUE TO THERE BEING NO HOME BUTTON!!! What kind of crap game has no repeat level or home button? Either way, you can only successfully beat a level with rewards and all only one percent of the time. It I really hope that a potential player sees this message and this saves them a great deal of frustration. Quite simply, this is straight up the worst mobile game I have ever played in my lifetime. If there was an ability to attach pictures to this, then I have the screenshots of the zoom malfunctions. Any player would be better off having never played this game, or even heard of it. Oh, and by the way, it says there are oh-so-many five-star reviews? Guess what! I scrolled down for a straight 3 minutes in the reviews and DID NOT SEE ONE FIVE STAR REVIEW!!!!

I highly recommend it, but it has its flaws once you‚Äôre about a week in. You reach a Plateau where it become hard to upgrade your characters and harder still to get better gear. My hero‚Äôs are level 28 and 29 but all the gear in the pvp shop is level 32 to 37 so I can‚Äôt buy stuff there. Same with the crates. I only get lvl 30+ from those now and on top of that I can‚Äôt complete the 3rd part of the daily missions to get the proto chests because it require 1,000 power more than any of my hero‚Äôs have. It‚Äôs give me a sense that the developers are trying to get me to spend money to upgrade, which I would totally do if it weren‚Äôt for how ludicrous the prices are for ingame purchases. The only bundle for dog tags that is half way decent costs $100! I‚Äôd spend $5 maybe $10 on dog tags, but their prices are so high that $20 is the minimum price for crystals that will buy your their lowest bundle of dog tags. The lowest bundle would not upgrade one of my characters once. This game clearly wants you to spend BIG money for no gain and that is really sad! It should be about the experience and fostering a good time not the money. But again, fun game. There are a lot of characters with different abilities, a lot of weapons with different effects and you would think a lot different strategies to play and get the W, but no. In PvP you have no control over your team, they battle in ‚Äúauto‚Äù. I think the PvP would be more entertaining and feel more rewarding if we were actually doing something besides arranging the order of which we fight. Winning is all based on ‚Äúpower‚Äù, regardless if your playing missions or in PvP which is an obvious ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù set up and there is no continuous competitive play or arcade mode which makes the game repetitive. You can only replay missions you have already beaten or replay expeditions which is only a few for a while because of the ‚Äúpower‚Äù problem mentioned before. Bottom line, if you play games for 5-15 minutes and are done and like SLOW progression, then this seems like a good fit. IF YOU ENJOY (semi)COMPETITIVE GAMEPLAY, THINK AGAINAlso there‚Äôs no social network here at all, that might make the game more interesting. Hello, thank you for your feedback. Everything that you've mentioned is in development. Unfortunately, we can't bring all at once; we're constantly adding new features.Non-auto PvP will be added when we would be able to establish more servers to support a more stable connection and fast response. It's a long-term goal, and we hope to reach it this year. Also, PvP is not about power, more about tactics, and calculating the right counter to the enemy's team. You can win against enemies a lot more powerful than you if you use the right heroes, weapons, and stones.Social features are in development and most probably will be added in the Update 1.5.Also, we hope to return competitive co-op gameplay soon, when (again) the issue with servers will be solved. Bombastic Brothers is a wonderful 2d platforming Run n‚Äô Gun with rpg elements. I even saw a few story elements to the old Contra games on Nintendo!  Always a great genre and super fun to play. I was having a fantastic time until I got to the 4th act and saw I was 4K power too short to continue further. So either need to make not such a giant gap in power to continue or create more ways to grind the dog tags and equipment you need to go further. I can‚Äôt upgrade my training room to make my heroes higher level, until I upgrade my bridge, and I am not strong enough to get more money and tags until I can. So I feel as if I‚Äôm stuck unless I spend a lot of money on just dog tags and gems. I always spend 5-10 dollars to help devs anyway, but I think I would have to spend much more to get anywhere. So great game devs, just need more ways to get what we need to keep going. The more time people are playing the game, the more likely they are to spend money! Keep up the good work!! "

I mean, you probably think this is just another dumb, no effort put into it, car racing game. But no, this one is different. I think there was actually a LOT of effort put into the making. First off, it's not impossible to win. I hate games where it's impossible to win, I just give up. But this game, you can ACTUALLY win. It's also good for killing time. TO THE GAME-MAKERS: I think it's so clever that the car customizations are merging cars! Some games are JUST merging things, so this is like 2 games in one. And I know you get a lot of bad reviews on how many ads there are, but I honestly don't think there are that many. And there IS a variety of ads, which I love because if I keep on seeing the same ad over and over again, I just close out the app.THANKS FOR READING When I got this game I thought it was not going to be what they said it was. It turns out that this game is amazing. I have had for almost 4 months and only had a few problems. It only froze and I had to close the app and then reopen it. It makes you feel happy because you get millions of coins after each race. The cars are really cool, and you never know what the next car will be. It could be a Porsche, or it could be a Bentley. I am currently at level 25 and have 50.8 billion coins. Other than the one little problem, this game is amazing. I got this app VERY recently and I have to say it is super fun and attractive. After a little it gets sort of boring you could say. Over all it is great, but there is a bug. There are SO many adds, and I usually don‚Äôt care about adds but it is abnormal. If your a patient person get this app, if you get angry about any adds you shouldn‚Äôt get this.This is a great app and it deserves 5 stars. Thank you for taking your time to read this!! "

But sadly the game lacks in a lot of areas animation quality, balance, weapon variety, customization, map and game modes.Although graphics are surprisingly attractive the stiff and up smooth animations distract you from the beauty of the game. The weapons are horribly over powered killing opponents with one shot to the foot while the player can survive an onslaught of close quarter unrelenting fire. There are a few weapons in the game but the variety needs heavy expansion and proper class organization. Player and weapon customization should be player choice, if you going to include custom skins and attachments in the game let the player choose which skin and attachments to equip or choose to go full default. So far the game seem to have 3 maps all of which are chosen at random when you play the 1 multiplayer mode, more modes and maps are heavily needed like (Free for all, battle royals, capture the flag, gun game, domination, kill confirmed, search and destroy, etc) also the ability to choose which mode and map you want to play.It may look as though this game is bad, but actually it‚Äôs a very enjoyable fully offline time passer in its early state, but it has a lot to improve and build on. It‚Äôs very hard to come across good graphic offline FPS games that don‚Äôt require any sort of internet connection.

I was 8 years old when Sonic came out in 1991; if it weren‚Äôt for Sonic, I wouldn‚Äôt have developed an interest in video games, and have loved his games since then...not including a few past and present flops (Sonic Boom the worst of it all). I‚Äôve even done much fan art and my own story writing/graphic novel work, as many fans of pretty much *anything* will do.     However...I am removing a star because of the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. When I first got this game I had to buy it...but it was ad free and wonderfully enjoyable. Now with the downgrading ‚Äúupdate‚Äù, I have to, in a sense, buy it a SECOND TIME just to remove the ads! I tried to restore the purchase of the game, but I only got an error, telling me that there were no purchases to restore. That takes the enjoyment of the game and tosses it in a pit of fire.     This issue is apparently a very large problem for all players who have already paid for the game. And if this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù moves to episode I, which I have as well, there‚Äôs going to be a lot more upset players who have already paid for the game(s).     Please, Sega, either refund all purchases that were done to originally buy this game, or automatically upgrade the game to premium for those players who have already paid for the game. It would make a whole lot of rather unhappy players feel better. If your looking for some amazing review about a game that costs 5$ so there‚Äôs no waste of money. The game is Ok. Then when you start your Sonic Adventure. You get a screen saying 2$ for no ads and get to play it offline so in total 7$ is going in the TRASH! Ok but if your gonna say I‚Äôm a ‚ÄúSonic hater‚Äù I‚Äôm not I try to defend him as much as I can against haters. And I love when they make a new game so I can get it. But when this game came out I got it and I was disappointed after awhile . Sure before when I first got it was fun and the part that made me hang onto the game was that I can play the acts from the first Sonic4 as metal Sonics story so after that it started to get boring. The Chaos Emeralds are really easy to get like the same as Sonic 2 but take out the hard part. So after I got the Emeralds I was bored how I get to the Death Egg fly and beat metal sonic super easy and then it sonic CD metal sonic race and uses that and then beat Eggmans final boss which is kinda hard and what you‚Äôve all been waiting for the ending. It ends when you escape the exploding death egg and take some air pods out and that‚Äôs it no other cutscene the credits rolls with sonic slowly going down from space.So I think the game is kinda.. No pretty bad but that‚Äôs my opinion so get the game if all that seems thrilling or anything so yeah. Okay, I'm going to start this off as bluntly as possible. A while ago, I thought that episode 1 was actually a good game. After looking at the game again though, I take that statement back.As for episode 2 though, it is INFINITELY better than episode 1. Everything got an upgrade, from Sonic's running animation and physics, to bringing back Tails and Metal Sonic.(also, thank god they fixed the physics.)I really enjoyed using Sonic & Tails' Co-Op moves. They all had a little bit of nuance to them, but once you got the hang of it, the levels are a blast to just speed through. Also, there‚Äôs a singular Red Ring to find in every level, alongside the 7 Chaos Emeralds. They are really fun to find, despite not getting anything for finding them all.The only things keeping this from 5 stars are the very jank parts of the game. Sometimes, I get hit by an obstacle or enemy that I clearly shouldn‚Äôt have been hit by. Also, there‚Äôs Episode Metal, which is supposedly unlocked when you own both episodes 1 & 2. I played episode 1 on my cousin's phone. I don‚Äôt own episode 1, yet I've played through the entirety of episode metal.Still a solid game though. "

Sprint for the leaderboards in the sequel to one of the App Store's most popular endless runners, which arrives with a host of fabulous improvements, from overhauled graphics to refined controls, original minecart and zip-line challenges, and much more. Originally this was my favorite game. As time went on they made more and more variations and maps for the game, which was fine. Lately, however, now that they‚Äôre on the money grubbing bandwagon, I noticed fewer coins on runs when you needed them. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough with all the money they must make on selling people gems and coins, they‚Äôve added aggravating ads. I must admit that I tried to buy out of the ends and for over two weeks they still kept showing even after I received my notice that payment was received. However I must amend my previous review because they did contact me through email, and the developers gave me directions which did in fact remove the aggravating ads. The developers have since asked me to revise my review, but I had been ill for a while. The review is deserved, and I have brought it back up to a five star. I always did love the game I just hated the ads. And now for a very reasonable price, you can get rid of them too thank you so much for helping me with this problem. I apologize for the delay in correcting my review, but I have had some health issues which thankfully seem to be subsiding. It‚Äôs a great game! I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time (at the very least five years) and although I‚Äôve stopped for periods of time, I always come back. The new maps and characters are always amazing, and the global challenges are great.HOWEVER. There‚Äôs always a however. Other people have talked enough about the ads so I‚Äôm not going to talk about that. Something that bothers me a lot is that now coins and gems are practically useless besides Head starts and Save mes. Before, you could use coins to buy new characters or outfits and gems to buy new characters and maps. However, now you can only unlock the new characters on special events and you need to purchase the maps with real world money.As I said, I‚Äôve been playing for a long time, so I don‚Äôt know if the older characters and maps are still able to be purchased with coins and gems. But Pirate Cove, Volcano Island qnd Enchanted Palace (and its characters) can only be purchased with dollars and I think that‚Äôs very unfair.I understand that you guys need to make money, but I would hope that ads, Usain Bolt and people purchasing packages and coin doublers in the store would be enough. There‚Äôs no need to block most of your users from obtaining maps and characters, they should be able to be gained by putting hard work into the game and earning coins and gems.Sorry for the long rant, but I wish you would take these comments into account and make these assests achievable for anyone. Hello Runner, we really appreciate your feedback. We shall forward your message to our developers so that they can review and consider. We really thank you for your continued support and suggestions to help us improve the game. Thanks and take care. "

Some things could make this game even more amazing, maybe adding more levels, weapon and more customizations, for example maybe choosing difficulty in each misssion and survival level (this could be done by adding more zombie spawns or subtracting), and possibly customizing the survival match by choosing what zombies you want to face (like in boxhead where you select or de-select zombies like the acid spitting one and red one, altering difficulty and changing final score) also add  a kill count on the end of each level would be nice, maybe even add other ai survivors to help you on survival after outliving or killing a number of zombies. This game is near perfect, with these updates, it will be Godlike. In my original review I took issue with the sound problems the game developed after various iOS updates. Surprise! the game has been updated with 64 bit support and is ready for iOS 11. This is a creepy game about battling the undead as you desperately try to stay alive. You'll battle threw various areas as you try to not become an undead happy meal. Though maybe not state of the art graphically, it does what it needs to do to put the player in a world gone bad.

Doesn‚Äôt seem too p2w just yet. However, the lack of content is an issue. Theres no real way to farm gold or pandora materials. You have to rely on Hot Time in order to get some gold  which is only for 3 hours on the weekend. The amount of gold ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù in that time is so minimal compared to how much items actually cost. We need some sort of gold dungeon. Also, there needs to be other ways to get materials for pandora. With pandora you need 3 materials to craft a piece of gear. Its totally RNG but supposedly the more materials you put in the higher the chance for good gear goes up. For a game that relies heavily on gear crafting there is absolutely no way to get those crafting materials besides doing daily and weekly achievements. They simply don‚Äôt give enough.

Unfortunately this game revolves around having good gear and the only way to do that is to not level up but to ‚Äúenchant‚Äù you‚Äôre gear which involves pulling dupes. The crafting system can be frustrating cause it‚Äôs completely RNG...You can spend all your resources or barely any and it won‚Äôt affect the rarity of the equipment pulled. So if you don‚Äôt pull dupes to help enchant your equipment you then are unable to unlock some of the more unique skills of your equipment which makes the difference in boss battles. Cause the conquest mode where you farm material to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù your equipment is significantly harder than the campaign which is what you play to unlock the conquest boss.So you become under power and unable to advance even. So if the developers want to emphasize equipment they need to re-haul crafting or make it to where you don‚Äôt need to pull dupes to unlock the unique skills needed to take down bosses. I want to believe in this game, but the traction on this game is slipping as more people are getting frustrated and quitting...the download numbers can show. Pretty soon people will start making rant videos as many of the content creators are 1) out of content to make and 2) leaving to play more popular games.

There is a glitch if you are running and you watch a video for a med kit or a gernade then you can‚Äôt die, I think this works because you can‚Äôt get damaged while running. And I would recommend you do this glitch in survival mode. Just go into a corner and hold backwards turn around and kill them when they come to you. And you can‚Äôt kill your self with your own gernades if you do this glitch, I WOULD DO IT QUICK BEFORE IT GETS PATCHED! Loving the game, would like them to introduce some male playable characters sometime, but other than that it's got solid gameplay mechanics! Characters play differently giving a fresh feeling to the gameplay and the story is the too shabby either. Co-op could use some fine-tuning. Hey guys.This game was fun to play and I liked the story mode. I think the company (Chinese origin) did well with the English as their second language! The dialogues, characters were interesting for an app game. The gameplay was smooth, but every time you get to a menu-option (cutting wires, guessing codes, even options menu) the screen would bug-out and it wouldn‚Äôt register your touches to navigate (skip an ad, watch an ad to revive, quit to the main menu). It made the game ultimately unplayable for me personally and I ended up uninstalling it out of frustration. If they fixed this I would consider reinstalling. Disappointing as their latest updates claim to have ‚Äúfixed bugs‚Äù, since this one literally made it so I had to continuously clear the app and reboot it every time it froze.

‚ÄéBacon ‚Äì The Game,"Put bacon on E V E R Y T H I N G ! Have you ever tried bacon on... ... ice cream? ... Pi√±a Colada? ... the United States of America? from the creator of ""Pancake ‚Äì The Game"" and ""Burger ‚Äì The Game""",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/ae/54/1b/ae541b9c-c2cd-39f3-1561-f7826546cdba/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-7.png/1200x630wa.png,Put Bacon on Everything!,4.8 ‚Ä¢ 69K Ratings,Free,,"April 2, 2019","I enjoy this game a lot, even if I get a bit frustrated at times. I am almost done with all of the levels, and it‚Äôs only been a couple of hours playing! I‚Äôm addicted! But, I have some suggestions. First of all, you HAVE to figure out a shorter way of getting between the levels. Maybe use a slider, or a level screen, I don‚Äôt care. I just don‚Äôt enjoy tapping 50 times through the level thing just to play one. It‚Äôs not very user friendly, if you know what I mean. Next, you should add some more ‚Äúattributes‚Äù to the levels when you make more. For example, I like the levels with objects that are slippery, or have a gravitational field. You should also do, for example, bouncy objects, like jello, or a trampoline. Or maybe sticky stuff, like slime, or glue, or something. Stuff like that, you know? Lastly, if you do end up adding more ‚Äúattributes‚Äù you should mix them up! Have an object that‚Äôs slippery AND bouncy! I can‚Äôt think of anything that‚Äôs slippery and bouncy, but I hope you know what I mean. Have fun with it! Feel free to respond!I love this game! Keep up the good work! üòÄüëç I‚Äôm really not one to write reviews but I wanted to express how surprised I was when I downloaded this app and began playing it. So first off, the concept is crazy, but also unique to say the least. I really downloaded this game with no expectations, it actually was recommended to be by the App Store and I decided to download it on the spot without looking at the reviews. I will start off by saying that if you‚Äôre the kind of person who likes to play games/apps that have any sort of story or any kind of purpose at all this is not the app for you. I will say however that the game design and idea are simple. You try to get bacon to land on a variety of random objects. Again, the controls are simple, the idea is simple, the game itself is simple but is well made! It‚Äôs just one of those apps you play when you‚Äôre bored, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that! BUT, the single most important thing that sets this app apart from the others is that it has VERY minimal ads. I‚Äôve only watched an ad one time and I‚Äôm one level 35 because you have the choice to watch an ad to skip a level. The lack of ads really ads to the vibe of the app itself, it‚Äôs super clean, simple, and minimal. I just did the first 50 levels and the hard one was putting the bacon on the.........ok, ok...the crossword puzzle. I have spent the last 1/2 hour giggling, chortling, and making funny noises as I tossed bacon from the frying pan onto/ into some pretty funny stuff..poor Francois Bacon...he definitely got his.....a fun, funny, and greasy game.... The bacon actually orbited the MOON!!! Check it out! I never recommend BAD GAMES...this is a winner....developers, keep the next levels coming! It‚Äôs going onto my cell phone to....can I laugh out loud just anywhere...?üò≤üòÇ   Today, there were amazing bacon launches....but, guys, turning ON certain items....really? (More giggles! My neighbors will be playing shortly, too!) SOUND EFFECTS ARE TERRIFIC!  Two days later...ok guys...great fun with the treadmill..I did not expect that...no need to service it....smooth!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£LATER...I have a bug to report, but there is no link on your App Support...how can I get in touch? No hiding, guys! (And it‚Äôs NOT SECURE? Oh,oh!) "
‚ÄéCity Jumper,The original City Jumper is one of the most popular web games of all-time and is now available as an App. It's been 15 years since the game was first released. The game has been played over 100 million times since it's debut. Your mission is to jump over famous San Francisco landmarks while avoiding the treacherous obstacles that stand between you and victory. Warning...this is a highly addictive game! Included in this version is City Jumper FULL VERSION including all 64 classic levels just like the original game.,https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple71/v4/27/59/79/27597973-a2b5-192a-39cb-6b90111d1548/pr_source.jpg/1200x630wa.png,,3.1 ‚Ä¢ 105 Ratings,$0.99,,"September 25, 2016","I just ""beat"" it. There are 64 different levels and when you beat the 64th you go back to the start with only the lives u have remaining. So level one becomes level 65. The catch is that you don't get a life after each level so you are stuck with what you had left. It would be nice if you could keep going forever like the computer version. I'd pay another buck for 50 more levels. With just two controls (small jump, big jump) CityJumper has found the key to fun game play. The game is easy enough to figure out, but a good sense of time makes getting it mastered difficult. Lives are plentiful and levels reasonably easy to get past. This is one game you'll play over and over again... "

I saw the commercial during another game and it has a similar title to a game I knew I would like so I downloaded it. I have hated wall games all the way back to when it was very likely the only electronic game you could own. I‚Äôm talking pre Atari, the true Stone Age of games. I‚Äôm sure I liked it when I first got it but when it‚Äôs the only game in town and then the Atari came out I began to hate it the same way I hated hair metal. I loved it at one time but now it‚Äôs embarrassing. The depth of this game, the affect characters have, the interesting levels all surprised me. I may start looking for other games I‚Äôve excluded as result of this game and hopefully I can conquer my traumatic gaming past. I‚Äôm obviously exaggerating traumatic and considering actual trauma faced everyday I needed to point that out so I didn‚Äôt feel like a dick for putting that in. Great game even if you hate wall bouncers. So I think this game is excellent overall. It‚Äôs a unique take on the normal brick breaker formula and it works very well. My main issue with the game is that you cannot train (level up) your team members beyond the level you are as a player. For example, if you are player level 20, that means you can‚Äôt level up any of your team members past level 20 either. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you literally have enough potions to level up a character to level 30, if you are only player level 20, then you can only level your characters to level 20. Only until you reach player level 30 can you use the potions that you‚Äôve had since you were player level 20 to level up your team members to level 30. This is a really dumb way to make the game more of a grind, not sure if this was intentionally done by the developers to make you want to pay real money to speed up the leveling process, but either way, it‚Äôs dumb. Developers, please fix this system. You already have other things such as energy limits and runes that can only be obtained in later levels to make the game more of a grind and slow progression, so why have the flawed training system too? Please let us train our team members to any level we can with the potions and coins we have, regardless of the level we are as a player. I want to be able to level up my characters when I have the necessary resources (potions and coins) to do so, NOT when I finally reach the next player level. Edit: Well I never lost interest... a few months later... game is still super fun. Once you get into the rhythm of the game and start upgrading heroes it becomes more and more engaging. Plus updates are constantly adding features and responding to player requests. Great game. Original review: First want to say that this game is super fun and puts a cool spin on the hero collecting/upgrading concept. Now for the negative: So I know devs are trying to get people to spend premium currency, but this is ridiculous. I can play for 15-30 minutes (including 1-2 level ups and tower) before I‚Äôm out of energy and have to wait OVER EIGHT HOURS before my energy is completely refilled. That‚Äôs absolutely insane. 3 minutes per energy is ridiculous. It needs to be 45 seconds to a minute or the devs need to severely reduce the energy cost. I‚Äôm only 2.5 days into this game and I‚Äôm already losing interest. "

The non hacker teams job is to keep the hacker off the podium. If they don‚Äôt the hacker wins and they lose.

Second, it would be really really nice to play actual people, and for rankings to actually matter (the more you win, the more skilled your opponents get). Third, and most important, please... please stop the incessant vibrating every single time anybody moves an inch. I get the idea, but I seriously can hardly stand playing it now.

However, I have had problems actually running in-game :)One could say this game is an acquired taste, but it's stupid fun.I have only one suggestion: make a ""reset"" button in a corner of the screen or something, instead of just double-tapping anywhere. I end up resetting when I try and jump. Kinda disappointing. I'd honesty give it zero stars if it would let me... let me start with this is no QWOP. Instead of you pressing the buttons Q, W, O, and P you now have to rotate TWO joysticks each with four functions for the legs that the joysticks control... the only thing that this states with QWOP honestly is the title, the motivation, and the fact that your character is apparently named QWOP. If you had a hard time using four buttons then have fun with what essentially equates to 8 and half the time you legs are very much exaggerated and don't match what they should be based on where the joystick is moved.

Spectacular visuals and spellbinding music bolster an epic tale that pits you‚Äîone of Earth‚Äôs few survivors‚Äîagainst the monsters who stole our homeworld. Fighting in your War-Mech battle suit‚Äôs a blast, with legions of ghastly foes ready for your lethal sword and fearsome firepower. If you like games long on style and ambition, this one‚Äôs for you.  I don't really know where to begin with this one. I'd have to say that this is the best--ever--game in the App Store. I was hooked from the minute the intro came on and from just that I knew it'd be awesome. I don't commonly write reviews(this is my third), but I felt like my reaction to this had to be shared. It was hard to see how a game could be even considered with a ten dollar price tag slapped on it, yet surprisingly I felt relieved I spent so much. Well, not that I spent so much, but rather what I got was beyond satisfactory. All of the RPG apps out there, as fun as they are, find it difficult to compete with this. Graphics are phenomenal and there's no lag, at least not on my device. The controls are perfect for mobile, and there's a ton of moves and upgrades to use(but not so many it doesn't distract you from the action). Yes, and the action! Nonstop yet diverse with each level--perfectly balances the story and combat. So if you're like me and can't make up your mind for your life, I recommend this game to you, and I promise...it's worth every penny. I mean, it's about a human-operated robot with a sword and laser gun fighting mechanically enhanced mutants in a dystopian future. What more could you ask for? I don‚Äôt get the pricing strategy RELATIVE to other games in the genre/App Store. That being said, I‚Äôll drop 10 bucks on my way home from work on a pack of craft beer; I‚Äôd rather spend money on a quality game than have the alternative: ads, IAPs, money grabs, and $99 pack of ‚Äògems‚Äô, so thank you for that. It seems to me like a price more in line with competitors would allow this game to stay relevant in the marketplace longer, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a strategy behind all that somewhere in the business model: or they love their own creation too much to price according to others in the App Store. (Again, I don‚Äôt normally play free games, I like getting a self-contained game and gladly pay for it).  Pricing strategy aside, PLEASE update so the game fits my iPhone X screen before I beat it! The controls can be frustrating when you‚Äôve learned how a boss moves and trying to get out of the way before a planned attack: mostly because my left thumb slides off the small format game area (iPhone X) and the player just stands there and gets hit. But there‚Äôs a learning curve to it (again, still giving 5 stars)If you like hack n slash/ level up games; I would recommend adding this one to your collection. Thanks team!

Packing silky smooth, lightning-fast combat, Hyper Light Drifter is a blast‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre just admiring the scenery. First off, fantastic game! I love playing this. Awesome storyline and reaches back to my younger years of playing Zelda etc. I play it on IPad and yes I also wish the controls were easier cause you can‚Äôt get the dash room achievements at all with IPad control system. Here‚Äôs the thing that happened. In the southern zone, the one module room that turns out to be a fake module and then you have to fight a mini boss. So as I have understood, it is still a module right? Cause after I defeat it you go to the next room and then pull the real module. But on my map the fake mod is still highlighted pink and I still haven‚Äôt been able to find the eighth module. I have looked all over and tried to reasearch the maps but it always points me back to the fake room. Is this a bug? Should I make a new game and try again? I also noticed something that happened when I equipped the Tanuki sword once I attained it, there would be an error window popping up and the game shuts down. Now all that is said, these are all things that I‚Äôm sure starting a new game will hopefully fix but I wanted you to know about it. I am a really big fan of this game cause it‚Äôs just too much fun. It‚Äôs nice to play something that actually feels like a real game with substance and it looks like real love was put into the making of it. Cheers! This game is amazing! So much fun and very rewarding! Only thing that needs to be done is the ability to remap buttons. Certain upgraded attacks are too hard to do in combat because my thumb is controlling movement and I have to hit two buttons at the same time to do dash attack. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be taken care of! Thank you for this amazing game! Best purchase in along time!!! Additional feedback... So I‚Äôve been trying to collect everything before I beat my first play through of the game and I went ahead and researched where the outfits were *slight spoiler I guess* and I see that one of the outfits is locked until you can get 800 consecutive dashes in the dash arena... I‚Äôve had a great time with the touch controls but I‚Äôm not gonna lie it kinda is disappointing that I will never get that outfit because it‚Äôs actually impossible to achieve 50 consecutive dashes with a touch screen let alone 800 lol. I hope you guys can add some kind of compromise so we can unlock the outfit! I understand this could have been missed in hindsight sense it‚Äôs much more achievable with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. Here‚Äôs to being hopeful that I can unlock everything!! Thanks again! "

While it lacks in any sound or sound effects the gameplay is very hands on and the random levels are challenging and leave you wanting to go back and replay it more and more.Suggestions for future updates:- Main Menu (ft. Play, Resume, High Scores, Settings, Help, Exit)- Sound / Sound Effects (but still allow the user to control these in a settings panel so they can listen to their own music)- High Score (show both local and global leaderboard)- Help (listing of the types of enemies, and listing of powerups)- Add powerups (multiple guns, explosive charges, lasers, seek-n-destroy missiles, planetary pulse, planet life boost, allied ships providing support)- Alternate Modes of Play (ex. Timed Challenge... complete a mission in an alloted time)- Challenge friends directly or at least offer and ""email a friend a challenge""- Look and Feel (the blue and red of the game is great, but you need to have a tighter adherence to the style in the pause button and high score screens)Keep up the great work and looking forward to seeing how this app develops out! I‚Äôve had this game since my first iPhone 3G in 2010 and it‚Äôs always been one of my favorites. However, I haven‚Äôt been able to play this game in several years because of incompatibility with modern iOS. Suddenly, and update comes from the developer several days ago, in 2019, claiming to bring compatibility to the game with modern phones, however the game still does not launch. I thought the developer had stopped working on the game, however that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case, although, whatever compatibility tweaks were incorporated in the latest update were not implemented correctly.

I‚Äôve played the original game for many years back in the day and it‚Äôs always been in my top 3 games from my childhood. It was one of the ones I had the most fun in. I coincidentally saw the game ad on instagram (funny to think about it), and I immediately thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs back?!‚Äù (kind of expected since many old games have been moving to mobile). I saw that the gameplay looked totally different and initially it threw me off because my dumb self was stuck with the original image of the game. After a while, I gave in and tried it out to see what it‚Äôs like, because who knows maybe I‚Äôll like it too. I couldn‚Äôt be more right, I‚Äôve been playing for almost a year already. The game keeps interesting since there‚Äôs always a sense of progression due to it taking reasonably long to evolve and having frequently updates. Also would not consider it pay to win (which is awesome), since paying seems more for speeding up growth and cosmetics. Although there are a few things that could be improved (no game is perfect), the staff does receive feedback with open arms it seems. So far, amazing mobile game, looks and feels really unique, and it‚Äôs very enjoyable! Great job! Hello Chaser! We are really pleased with your feedback. Thank you so much for your continuous support for our game since the PC version. We're glad you gave this game a chance so you can continue your wonderful adventures! Feel free to contact our support at grandchase_official@kog.oqupie.com for any concerns, questions and suggestions for our game. We're more than happy to assist you. Long live the Chase! Big player of Elsword and Grand Chase on PC. A lot of people‚Äôs initial reactions to this before its release was filled with lots of doubt, but I am very happy to say that it was misguided, elitist doubt. This game is very fun to play even for people who are not familiar with the story, and very free to play friendly! (At least, upon initially release. 2 weeks in, still find it very enjoyable.) I would not recommend buying 99% of the microtransactions because the ratios of premium currency to real currency are not great. If they were more generous with prices, they might find more sales for currency, though I believe most money is made on skins which is later on going to be in this game. Also, if you don‚Äôt like Gacha, maybe avoid imported games like this, but I would say there‚Äôs a lot of ways to chance your gacha, so P2W isn‚Äôt very dominant imo.From a gameplay and aesthetic perspective, I would say this is great mobile game, especially if you cannot afford to spend 24/7 attention to it. There is no stamina feature, so you can play as much as you want (or can, anyway) or as little, limited only by dungeon limits and the strength of your characters. There‚Äôs lots of ways to earn resources and it‚Äôs very satisfying to get them!My biggest tip for newer players: SAVE YOUR B-RANK HEROES! You can get 3k premium currency (equal to 10 rolls in gacha) if you save all the ones you get from the story and level them up all the way. I started playing the original grand chase back around 3rd/4th grade when ronan was first released and i was hooked on the game ever since. I played the game until the servers eventually closed and that wasnt the best of times. When i saw that this game was basically a sequel to the original game i thought ‚Äúdoesnt hurt to try it out‚Äù. The main thing that hooked me to the original game was all of the special events and armors/characters that you‚Äôd spend days collecting items for, the amazing community back when the servers were almost filled and the gm‚Äôs that would be around to chat with players and play alongside of the players. This game kinda brings me back to the old days especially with the soundtrack and the characters that i used to love playing(ronan,lass,asin,dio). It would‚Äôve been nice if players that originally played grand chase when it was on pc couldve had a chance to kinda get something to display that they have previously played the original game, but thats beside the point. The game definitely is fun and still addicting(probably becauae of nostalgia) but i have ran into problems. The game does really enjoy crashing whenever i play and i dont know if its an issue with my phone but it kinda ruins the experience. Hi Chaser! Welcome back to GrandChase!

The graphics are great and you get a good selection of jets you are able to fly anywhere in the world. I‚Äôm no physicist or a pilot, but you don‚Äôt have to be one to remember Newton‚Äôs 1st Law: ‚ÄúAn object that is in motion will stay in motion unless an external force acts upon it. An example of this is when a jet goes into a stall. It doesn‚Äôt pull a Coyote and Roadrunner stunt and just stop on a dime and fall out of the sky. It still has some forward momentum and glides down as it slowly descends. It also means that upon landing the nose doesn‚Äôt smack down on the tarmac as soon as the back wheels touch down. If you watch a plane coming into land, you will notice that the pilot keeps the nose up as long as possible and then, after 500 feet, they slowly ease the nose down and TOUCH the front wheel to the tarmac. One thing that would help with this is if you had the AOA right on the planes.One other minor thing that needs fixing is the fact that you can‚Äôt see the water on the map setting while in flight.One jet you should add is the F-15 Strike Eagle Alright, hands down this is the best flight sim out there. However, it's gotten really flat since you can't really engage in combat. UPDATE:( well after finding out that air fighter is now a subscription I don't know what to think about rortos anymore) I spent money to buy the pro so I wouldn't have to worry about having to purchase new upgrades when new things came out. I saw that the basic ""air carrier landings"" has gotten a recent update with a new aircraft. Fortunately you need to buy all the aircraft if you want them. Meanwhile the pro version still has not been updated for almost a year now. What a shame. I was really loving rortos but looks like you guys have followed along other corporates... The graphics are phenomenal, the list of aircraft to choose from is superb but the physics of flight is just not right! Granted I am no aerodynamic engineer (YET) but I do happen to know quite a bit about airplanes and how they fly. So I will cut right to the chase. Problem One, the decent/accent rate is off based on the AOA. Now I won't go into any mathematics but an experienced flyer can clearly see that it is off. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE in future updates (sooner rather than latter) correct this problem by, 1 making the stall speeds much lower, 2 allow for aircraft decent even when the nose is pitched up at high degrees, and 3, when landing allow the user to EASE the nose onto the tarmack. Currently the game is programmed to slam the plane into the ground the second it touches down. So please correct that and all that I have mentioned for optimal realism! "

The shortcut buttons are A+B, for 3rd Strike style overhead, and A+C. I have no idea what A+C does. A good shortcut would be C+D which is a game mechanic when your character is in TOP style. Imo the shortcuts are necessary on a phone. The game is a ton of fun if you can use the old school inputs. Definitely buy this. Would be 5 stars if the shortcuts worked correctly. One of the finest fighting games I've ever played. Full of depth, amazing characters and slick colourful animations. Not the best way to experience the game but definitely worth it to have this in a handheld form. I hope they continue the series someday. There has been a long drought in good fighting games. I'm glad to have this to remind me of the good times :) Thanks SNK and DotEmu. BTW the multiplayer didn't work for me. I'm looking forward to playing with people online. Also don't forget about Last Blade 2 and all the other amazing titles in the catalogue. PS for people complaining about the controls there are hotbuttons you can swipe for easier input and I'm actually shocked how well they got the controls. Peace! Pretty good for a touch screen game. I'm all about physical controllers,but this is playable enough for a phone game. It has buttons that make the harder moves easier to pull off if you just can't seem to get the touch controls down. Haven't tried with icade jr. yet, but I was more interested in being able to carry this game in my pocket and play it on the go on my break at work or something. It serves the purpose in my opinion. Grab it while it's 99 cents;)Update: Tried with icade jr. and it works pretty good. I can't figure out how to change the button configuration,but the default has it as A=upper left buttonB=lower left buttonC=upper right button D=lower right button So it works out good for me. Only complaint I have is with the touch controls. I agree with other reviewers that this game needs a c+d button while using touch screen. Besides that it works pretty good.Update 2:I have noticed occasional slowdown, but the game still runs good for the most part on my iPhone 5s. Still recommend if you can grab it at 99 cents. Still a fun casual fighting game to pull out for a quick bit of entertainment:) "

The amount of work and polish on display is simply inconceivable.  Controls are good.  I'd prefer a joystick, but you can't blame the devs for thatExtremely difficult.  This is a game for people who want a serious challenge.It's almost impossible to compare this to any game made or distributed in the US.  This is on the level of something like DoDonPachi, a game too difficult for western audiences, but it's just the thing I want.I still think Steredenn is the best iOS shooter, but I have 100s of hours on that game and I just downloaded this baby tonight, so my opinion might change.This is definitely worth twice the asking price, but only if you want a legit bullet hell experience.  Frankly, it's so beautiful that it's worth the price just for the visuals.  DU3 is a rare treat, approaching perfection.  I normally would never write a review on day one, but with a shooter, you know what you've got pretty quickly.  I've played literally 100s of games like this, and this is a shining example of the genre, not to be missed Great game, beautiful graphics, addicting, and smooth. BUT there are some links that need to be worked out. The graze counter is the most evident. You can graze a cluster of 20 ""bullets"" and only get 4 points in your graze counter. Combine this with the break between phases but not freezing the graze meter, and getting a high number on graze is impossible.Overall really fun game, super difficult but just what I was looking for.

This game is so much fun and exciting and frustratingly hard at times and I absolutely love it. I actually like this game so much that I chose to write a review about it without being asked by anyone. I actually searched for the rate this app link because I wanted to give it 5 stars that badly. Having said that, i must write this disclaimer: I don‚Äôt think this game is for everyone. Some people will not like it, some people might even hate it, but I love it so much that it‚Äôs going on my list of top 5 favorite games. Not just too 5 games on my phone, but from any console. I think the game is genius and a lot of fun and I don‚Äôt want to ever not have it around. Okay, review over. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoy the game! My favorite zen game! Although, I‚Äôm constantly feeling the lack of speed. I would greatly like to see a new kind of ‚Äúflow‚Äù - like ‚ÄúContinuous‚Äù but with an ability to manually set the speed of your session. But not like the ‚ÄúSpeed run‚Äù mode, where, if you make a mistake the speed of the run drops. Instead, that you would have a constant speed, without it dropping on a mistake the speed, which you would set according to your likings. And speed increase could be up to 300%, then maybe the game needs to run on much higher fps.Once again - Great Game! Thanks! "

Challenging but not crazy hard and runs just the right length of time. Fun mashup of breakout and Space Invaders. I wish it kept a high score list and not just the highest score. Would be nice too if it had daily/weekly/all-time online high score lists too, with iPhone and Watch lists separate. But this is fun on Watch. Might even be my favorite Watch game. ...The developer has replied to my inquiry about this, and I am updating the review as such. He is trying to replicate the issue ...This would be my favorite game and would have five stars. Awesome sound effects, graphics, and concept. Gameplay is good too, but as two others have mentioned, there is a flaw in the control. The paddle will sometimes freeze for up to a couple seconds. So far, the developer's suggestion is to make sure your finger stays below the paddle. After trying this for awhile, it does seem to reduce the occurrence of the issue, but it does still happen occasionally, and I'm not yet sure whether it's due to my consciously careful finger placement, or just that it's working better randomly at this particular time.  See a game like ""Break Classic"" by BootAnt for the same control that works flawlessly.That said, I _DO_ still wholeheartedly recommend this game. The flaw isn't so bad that it's not worth the price. It's just a minor annoyance sometimes (and apparently only for some people).Also, could use a volume control... sounds are a bit loud. And after fixing the touch control, eventually adding tilt control (like on Jirbo Break) might be interesting! Still loving this app. Fun to play on the watch while waiting in line or out and about. Quick hit gaming with fun retro feel. They keep on updating app too to make sure it works on OS updates. Thanks!Great retro game for the watch. It's like space invaders & block out combined! Works really well on the Apple watch. Uses new API's from watchOS 3. Nice scrolling with the crown and even uses the watch speaker for the great retro sounds. Love it! Next gen of watch games is here! "

Etc. I mean, I haven't had this much tension( in an exciting way)and fun in a game for a long time. Please go watch some game plays before buying this game, because as you can see, some ppl bought this game knowing nothing about it, which gives them no expectations. For me, always trying to find an arcade old school game that dosent look outdated, this game is perfect for that. Apple, please don't delete more comments(since this game isn't spamming any 5star reviews) I reviewed this game( which I barely do on any paid games I bought)because I had tons of fun playing it, and I want the developer to make more! Know who's really spamming 5star reviews is important, Apple. From a gamer I usually do not write reviews, but I decided it was needed for this game. The graphics are amazing, it's very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The music grabs you and tugs you back into simple 8-bit music, and it fits well with the gameplay, even I, who would turn on music while playing games instead of listening to the soundtracks, kept the sound on for this game. Some people might complain the gameplay is repetitive, but compared to other ""free"" war or matching games, it's pretty tame, and takes it's own spin on things. Some people will whine because they aren't open to games that take a different direction. I highly suggest this game for any looking for a nice time waster, this is with no doubt worth the 2 dollars.

Would have been cooler if you could get these from the alien ships like in the original this game is copied from. When Chillaxian was released maybe two or so years ago I played it all the time and loved it. Like most apps, it made its way to the furthest reaches of my iPhone after a few months. I was so happy to see it featured in the App Store as a throwback favorite. I immediately downloaded it again and it's like returning to an old classic ‚Äî only its brand new and absolutely perfect for mobile. Oh, and the curved missiles are a brilliantly executed touch. They make you feel like you're throwing big left and right hooks at your opponent while solving the chase problem so common to Galaga. I'm guess the best I can say about this game is that the developer just gets it. Ages ago (in the 90s) a free game came with my Macintosh computer: 'Pegleg II': it was simple, fun, and addictive enough to cause all-nighters of gameplay. .. It was The Stuff. But come osX out went Pegleg II and I've been on a hunt for the last decade-plus to find a game at all like Pegleg with zero luck ...until now: enter Chillaxian: Very similar concept / feel and VERY fun to play. With Chillaxian you just maneuver - your ship shoots - this might not Sound intriguing until you get a feel for the controls: they're fantastic and allow the player to become immersed in the wonderfully lo-fi Chillaxian galaxy. AWEsome game and completely worth the asking price. "

In January 1980, a young and ambitious treasure hunter finds an ancient sanctuary hidden in the depths of an impassable jungle.  While exploring the temple, he discovers untold riches and powerful ancient artifacts. However, getting out of the temple with the treasure turns out to be quite a challenge.  The sanctuary is full of intricate deadly traps and its dark labyrinths abound in bloodthirsty beasts hunting for new souls. Multiple skeletons scattered here and there are a sign that the temple had been visited before, but let no one out alive. The protagonist has no other options but to do everything he can to avoid the fate of his predecessors. Our hero is accompanied by a mysterious grumpy ghost and an ancient stingy genie.

Have been playing it for over a month. However, I have reached a point in the last TWO WEEKS where I cannot play the levels because the ads do not allow me to continue. They show up, and I have waited as much as five minutes, but they don‚Äôt ‚Äúend.‚Äù The only options are ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù or close. If I close it, the level doesn‚Äôt begin and I‚Äôm stuck at the level selection screen AGAIN! Even if I hit learn more and come back to the app, the ad doesn‚Äôt let me play the level. I have been stuck for such a long time. This is also the case for the final fantasy ad. Even if I play the entire mini game, when I close the ad the level does not start, and I‚Äôm back at the level selection screen... I want to finish the story but I cannot progress as much as one level. Please change the types of ads you have. add more of the 30 second video ads because those are the ONLY ads that allow me to progress. I will give five stars if someone can tell me how to get past these ridiculous ads or the developers offer ads that will allow me to continue playing. Thank you.Edit: About three days after I wrote the review, more video ads were added. Thank you for your feedback, I am sorry to hear of this issue.

Thanks for your help!Kind regards,GameHouse I will admit, when I read the reviews, I was worried.  I had NEVER seen in the history of Gamehouse seen a game I didn‚Äôt love.  Nay sayers be darned.  This game is free to play!  HELLO?!  Am I the only one who saw that?  Granted, for the obsessive players, this could be a bit of a deterrent; however, then pay for the power ups and not the game.  Amazing story.  My poor Daniel‚ÄîI am rooting for his recovery.  If you have a ‚Äòhistory‚Äô with this game‚Äîno, I‚Äôm not creepy, but I am a writer, and I appreciate stories where I can develop an understanding/RELATIONSHIP of the characters.

I wanted a cheap alternative to Minecraft. But, honestly, don‚Äôt cheap out and buy this one. After my experience with this demo it really doesn‚Äôt appeal to the audience of Minecraft. It doesn‚Äôt have the expectations Minecraft does. I can understand that Microsoft is a big company and can push updates regularly, and come up with many unique things in their game like the Nether, the marketplace with community created maps, behavior packs, music, texture packs and so much more! For a couple extra dollars, you can have an overall better experience. Don‚Äôt cheap out on this game, it just isn‚Äôt really worth it compared to its competitor. I wouldn‚Äôt say this is a direct ripoff, either. I would rather label it as ‚Äúinspiration.‚Äù Now I‚Äôve played most god these games and I love them, but I‚Äôm gonna suggest some more things to enhance the game.Try to add ruined military operations from the USSR and the US, like adding tanks, destroyers (RARE), and (LEGENDARY) an bomber or jet fighter, I know this is kinda modern but it adds a lot of history of what might of happened on a area.(Add submarines if possible too please) And also add more guns, like a AA turret to get rid of NPC fighters, (this is rare and they might take you to a somehow operational base, unless they think ur hostile, (don‚Äôt hold a weapon) and also add MG guns and old WWII rifles and assault rifles, this will enhance how much u can use to defend a area.Last suggestion : add NPC soldiers, boats, and planes. And a radio, also some medical equipment. This will give a challenge if they are allies with you and they could help you out somehow. But be warned, some will be hostile if you hold a weapon. Unless they already met you and know ur safe. And I‚Äôm done with the ideas. But dev if your reading this thank you for creating these games and I hope you take my ideas, I also hope it‚Äôs not too much for the game and too much to ask. So I love this could you add flint & steel and steel armor also add s a shield and iron gold diamond netherite and add enchanted books anvils and a portal that leads to the nether and another that leads to the enter dragon and add seed for it and add it to where it is not very hard add a tutorial when you are new to the game from building a house or a camp site on survival and add a bell and villages and more furniture like a switch that connects to a nearest lamp and add lamps to the game Like the one in the actual Minecraft that‚Äôs not copy right make your own bell that‚Äôs way different from the bell Actual bell that‚Äôs cool and add five nights at freddys and servers and multi player where you click play it has worlds friends servers multiplayer worlds.

When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other.

From the start the app sets you on the right course as you choose what platform you are playing the game on and what language it is set in. From there you are able to explore the app as you see fit. There is a good wealth of content included in the application concerning information of all kind. The only area that I can tell that could use more data is Grand Theft Online.

I've always liked platformers like this. The problem I have with this game is it's is somewhat glitchy. I often run into invisible walls and sometimes I get sunk into the ground. If you are jumping from the edge of a platform, it will not allow you to jump twice,  assuming that the jump was already on its second jump. In the 12th level, I keep getting stuck between the rail and the ground when I am riding in the rail cart... then I die and have to start the whole level over again.  Little things like that can ruin a game. I hope they improve this game, because I really do like it and it is worth a play through even with the glitches. "

Overall, I enjoyed my short time with this game. Sometimes a loss felt out of my control, but at least the Continue system is generous. Some interesting twists in combining combat with pinball, but there‚Äôs a limited amount of content and depth here. Would enjoy new content in the future. As is, a fun way to kill a few hours. Great concept, love the Game Boy Pocket grayscale art style, and there are plenty of different screens/tables to keep me entertained. However, this game is almost impossible to play because the left flipper only works about half the time, and it‚Äôs nothing but infuriating. Also, the pause button and magnifying glass button are in a terrible location on the screen; they‚Äôre right where I want to have my thumbs to use the flippers. And the fact that the magnifying glass icon starts highlighting itself every time you enter a new screen because it wants you to press it and read about the goals in the room is super annoying. Why would I want to stop the action to read the goals? Either make the goals more apparent without instruction (which I actually think they are, so it‚Äôs redundant) or have the goals flash on screen like every other video pinball game on the market.This has the potential to be a really fun game, but between the ONLY action input not working properly, and some questionable design and UI choices, I‚Äôll probably never be able to actually enjoy it.Definitely do not recommend this game in its current state. A fun game... when it works. As other reviewers have said, there is an issue with the flippers not registering being tapped which is really frustrating. Also, there is a magnifying glass that appears in the lower left corner that you can tap on to tell you what tasks you need to perform, but the game doesn‚Äôt pause when you do so you‚Äôll most likely lose your ball. Also frustrating. It‚Äôs a shame cause it‚Äôs a fun concept but until these bugs and issues are fixed, I‚Äôd stay away. "

I played the entire game in a bit over an hour..... but only because I'd played Monument Valley before. I can't begin to understand the 3-dimensional thinking involved to create something like this.Nice game! Obviously inspired by the monument valley games. (I was kind of hoping to see that they‚Äôd been mentioned in the credits somewhere.) The story is okay, but needs some polishing for sure. It would be nice to have something a bit more fleshed out than the relatively cliche ‚Äúcivilization gets rekt by computers‚Äù thing. Although I did appreciate the attempt to make the narrative less abstract, I can‚Äôt help but feel like something important is missing there. The graphics are very nice, the music is soothing, and I got a couple hours of puzzle solving from this game. I can‚Äôt quite give it five stars because, although this game is enjoyable as a stand-alone experience, it really does pale in comparison to the monument valley series. Ok..so when I first saw this, I couldn‚Äôt believe someone had ripped off Monument Valley app... it‚Äôs a simpler version. Having said that, if you loved MV, then you will enjoy getting to do these type of puzzles again! Not too difficult, and overall-its  relaxing and enjoyable. I would love the developers to explain how they were able to develop a version that is SO similar to MV? I think that will satisfy many potential players. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

The only reason I told her not to do it was because it was too complicated for a 4 year old (also little kids can be traumatized by anything). I do believe this is an amazing. The pixel art is fantastic and the gameplay is well made. While playing the game, I have only run into two problems. First, when I first saw the opening cutscene, I noticed it ran on its own so I let it roll on. My phone fell asleep halfway through the cutscene. I‚Äôm unsure if you can control that but it would be nice anyway. The second problem - and the more important one - is when you gain a heart or soul heart right as you take a hit that kills Molli. What will happen is the death animation plays, but it doesn‚Äôt take you out of the game. In fact, you can still move Molli around in her one-sprite form all you want, since the game thinks you‚Äôre dead nothing harms you. The problem is that the game will never truly register an outcome, for it thinks the character is both dead and alive. The only way to escape is to exit to main menu, getting rid of any experience the run gave. I have had this happen to me at least twice and it has frustrated me all the same. If this could be fixed, I would greatly  approve This enticing and challenging game has had me playing it over hours and hours. The story has a quirky and define shape throughout the game. I enjoy the animation and general aesthetic that emanates from the art style and gameplay. The games levels of difficulty inspire me to work harder to get more upgrades and get better weaponry. The extra quests and interaction between characters add to the depth. But one thing kind of bums me out was the expectation that there will be more modes and levels to fuel my love for this but it ended so prematurely and how it was kind of short sparked a kind of sadness that I wanted to try to resolve because this game seems simple but I enjoyed it and I would love there to be more for me and others. I highly recommend this game among a lot of games on my phone. Love this game, my friends saw me playing it on the bus, and now they love this game, too. I'd say my mare gets issue with the game is bugs but  most of them were fixed in this latest update. Although I do have a few suggestions (I don't know where to leave them so I guess i'll just leave them in this review)-buff curses, I often have no reason to pick any of them up, simply because there'll be candies that are literally just better in every way(especially the undead curse, because if you have enough hearts, it puts you in a WORSE position)-add a way to track NPC quests-add some way so you can find out which enemies are which! I often find myself with a quest that requires me to kill a number of some type of enemy, yet I never have an idea which enemy it is. "

Story is kinda generic, but not terrible. The one flaw I‚Äôm seeing so far is that the narrative subtitles tend to go by really fast, even if I‚Äôm not touching the screen. Makes it really hard to experience the story when the dialog subtitles whiz by at the speed of light, especially when there is no voice acting for 75% of the dialog. This game is decent at best in its current form could be way better. So far what I like is the combat I like real time more than turn based. The characters are pretty likable from I played so far I‚Äôm in CH3 in the story. That being said the voicing seems lack luster it started strong voicing almost everything then most of CH2 was barely voiced. There‚Äôs no timers for the recharge on stamina or pvp flags that‚Äôs a bit bothersome. I don‚Äôt quite like the pricing for draws either 750 seems a bit much for only getting 9 gems per stage I know it‚Äôll all add up but content will eventually run dry. PVP is auto based in a straight line just sit back and watch your team win as you get to pick who you face. Gacha seemed fairish? I got a character every 10 pull but they were 3 star I also didn‚Äôt check the rates so that‚Äôs kinda my fault. Gathering mats seems tedious that‚Äôs with most CR promoted games tho. Overall I‚Äôll give this game a chance but I won‚Äôt hold my breathe hopefully things change a little like the timer I mentioned earlier but it‚Äôs been 2 days I‚Äôm the first written review? I don‚Äôt think that holds too well for this game.Edit: There is no refill over time for stamina... so the only way to get more is by leveling up your account (Which feels like it takes for ever.) and buying stamina refills (Which is 25 gems per refill?)... this is a horrible business tactic It‚Äôs 2020 and we‚Äôre taking 20 steps back into poor decisions. The game is not bad. The characters and story are interesting and the graphics are decent. The main thing that I do not like is the combat. The battles require a lot of skill early on and you quickly hit walls. The real time action is nice, but there are many issues: Large enemy attacks are hard to dodge and happen too quickly, especially when there is several enemies and things to watch. Also, the camera follows the leader, meaning that you can lose track of your other characters and have to switch leaders to see what is happening with each character. While this isn‚Äôt too bad, I wish that the camera could be zoomed out. The controls are also not the best and can be unresponsive at times. The result of these issues combined is that a team of 100,000 battle rating can lose against a 60,000 battle rating stage. Overall, the game is fun, but I think it should be a bit easier for users to fight. Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

My internet is slow so it sometimes glitches a bit but I can‚Äôt complain, overall it‚Äôs one of the best online survival games ever. I enjoy playing with friends and creating things and I don‚Äôt mind if they are destroyed because I can always rebuild and that‚Äôs the fun of itüòÑ I just have a few suggestions on different things you could add in the future: flying animals; there are no creatures that fly in the sky, I think it would be fun if there were bats or something that attack you. I love a challenge! Or maybe be able to shoot down birds with a bow when you hunt instead of shooting chickens that sit on the ground. Water creatures; I know adding these things make it more like Minecraft but if you don‚Äôt make them look or act exactly like the Minecraft mobs it wouldn‚Äôt seem like the same game, can we pls have a fishing option to make a rod and go fishing?! What is the point of the water if there isn‚Äôt anything living in it! Anyway I have other ideas but I don‚Äôt want to bother! Great job with this game it beats all! Thx! I absolutely love this game! But the glitches are driving me nuts the lucky blocks are really fun but most of the time it spawns witches and skeletons with full chain armor. Please raise the probability in getting something good. Another thing is that I can‚Äôt seem to change from creative to survival or survival to creative please fix this it‚Äôs bugging a lot. I also think that the spiders in the game should not have potions like invisibility. For some reason I can‚Äôt go through the portal every time I try it doesn‚Äôt take me anywhere. It‚Äôs very strange. I want to be able to craft more items like soul sand or something like that. I also HATE that behind every diamond there is freaking lava! I don‚Äôt want my diamonds to disintegrate. The chances of you actually finding diamonds is very VERY low. I also don‚Äôt understand why there are emeralds in creative but they don‚Äôt exist in survival. Other than that the game is REALLY REALLY REALLY glitchy. I swear my cousin almost lost his diamond cause he couldn‚Äôt move and a freaking zombie was attacking! I wish I could give this five stars but these glitches are making me change my rating by the way i love the new update for enchanting thank you for reading I hope you see this and fix the things the thing I want most is to change from creative to survival and survival to creative. Dear customer!Please, send your cousin our contact(sergey.levchuk@solverlabs.com) to share a detailed description of the issue, OS version so that we can help her fix all problems. Please explore the world more by foot or teleport through portals to find more minerals. We will take your wishes into attention in future updates! Stay tuned! We hope that you will improve your review. Heyyyy! So I started playing this game because originally I wanted minecraft, but I couldn‚Äôt, so I scrolled down and found this game. I thought hmmm okayyy well this will work I guess, and I also thought it would just be a rip-off version of Minecraft, but to this day, I still play it!!! I have been playing for almost 2 years now, and even though this isn‚Äôt Minecraft, it‚Äôs really good! The only thing that I with there was is horses you can actually ride, and you can make saddles, carrots on sticks, be able to maybe actually become friends with, tame, and ride scorpions and also go fishing. Other than that, I will say that you definitely need to play this great amazing game!! You don‚Äôt even need to pay for it, and you can remove ads if you save up enough coins. I am also glad that they don‚Äôt pay or influence people to write good fake reviews. Come and totally play this game!!! "

There aren‚Äôt enough survival games styled like this and I‚Äôd love to see this game become more developed because I really think it‚Äôll become a popular game. It does need some work though. The graphics aren‚Äôt the greatest but graphics don‚Äôt need to be super great for a game like this. You just have to add more in game items and functions. If you need an example game look at Rust it would be the perfect game to get ideas from. Just start with small things like new upgrades for the bases you build, maybe a cave location or something and continue from there as the game gets better and bigger. This game always has a good amount of active people so I know as it gets better it‚Äôll get bigger. I‚Äôm honestly excited to see how much better this game gets in future. It‚Äôs a great game I love the concept of creating servers and joining them it makes the game more fun because it‚Äôs easier to play with friends and meet new people! The things that bother me are that if your hatchet breaks then your basically done for. You can fix this by making the hatchet permanent and you can‚Äôt remove it from your inventory even if you die. You can remove the crafting buttons for the hatchet and the problem is fixed! Another thing is that the ammo and arrows don‚Äôt do anything I spent so long trying to get ammo for my weapons until I found out that they did nothing, it‚Äôs a waste of material and it‚Äôs not the best idea to add. Especially if you use coins to buy them (which I don‚Äôt) and since coins cost money that‚Äôs basically scamming so you might want to get that fixed. And one more thing can you please make it so when you die you only lose some of your inventory. Example: I have a shotgun sticks and a campfire, if I die only take away some of my things like since I have four items maybe take two? And if I have a even amount of items then take half. It‚Äôs simpler and it will make the game more fun!! Thank you and I will read your comment if you respond. This game me and my friends love this survival game so much because there‚Äôs a lot of stuff to do but we have been looking for a survival game for a long time and this came up we tried and fell in love all the problems we had with it was that we would get furnace glitches, laying on the ground, and we just want more stuff cause when you get all the good items you run out of stuff in the game so please developers please work on more updates I don't  expect you to respond fast and do it we are all going through this together and it will stop eventually but here‚Äôs a game to look at to get some ideas this survival game is called rust it‚Äôs on steam so look at it and maybe play it and get some  ideas they have a lot of stuff on that game so please look at it and get some  ideas for update on your game thank you for this game it‚Äôs good I love it. üòç "

From the opening moments of the first chapter, 1979 Revolution is one of the best, most immersive historical narratives I've ever enjoyed. I put it in the same category as VALIANT HEARTS; these games excel as games AND history AND cultural commentary. Player choices lead to surprising outcomes that challenge our moral assumptions and demand a second play through. In short, 1979 Revolution is a work of art, and in my humble opinion, a masterpiece at that. The games industry needs more globally relevant work like this. Cheers to the creators at iNK Stories for bringing this morally challenging, emotionally charged vision of the recent past to life. I've had this game sitting on my phone for months now because I wanted to dedicate my full attention to it. I'm glad I waited. Not only is the game look and feel good, the plot line based on real events is rock solid. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time even though I was controlling the protagonist. I smiled at memories and cried at tough decisions I had made. It's so thorough, I'm extremely excited to see what will happen in playthroughs with different choices. Hands down, the best game I have played on this platform. I love the concept and story. It feels like your in a movie. I love how the game is built around real history and how the history is incorporated into the game. Great graphics. I can tell a lot of time went in to making this game. It should get way more recognition than it has gotten! So glad I came across it and decided to purchase it! Try it you will love it too! "

Problem is, this is not a game that's easy to translate to iOS.  The controls are awkward, but the worst part is the broken ""sprint"" function.  Good luck trying to get it to work, because there's no consistency to when it does.  It works when it wants to.  The glitches aren't major, but are enough to distract you from the game.  Overall, this could be a great port, but the messy controls almost ruin the experience. At first I want you to have my sincere thanks for bringing this old but very important for its genre game on iOS. But still this port needs some serious improvements. Here are some great suggestions what to fix:- Do something about controls. Make them more adequate. I know you are trying to keep the game the way it was back in 1992, but ,since it's not MS-DOS(PC), I don't think people will complain about few new buttons that would replace some ""older"" ones. That especially goes to the combat part, which is very complicated with touch screen. Not to mention the ""sticking"" moment. Also make menu buttons tappable, not controlled by arrow buttons. If that means you'll have to change menus' layout, then do it. Just keep the art style. Again, this is not PC.- Would be nice if you could bring back the details of all 3D objects. Here they have less of them than in PC version.- Fix the music. Some of music tracks play where they are not supposed to. Music in the beginning actually plays when the doors of Derceto close once Edward/Emily go through them.- It also would be great if you could add voices that read texts(character info, letters, books, notes)For now that is all. I sincerely ask you to consider all these moments and do something about them. Thank you for understanding! Playable on the iPad.  The original game had pretty hard controls.  And it's even harder on the iPad mostly because the controller ""button"" has to be pressed by multiple fingers to be effective.  The double tap to run is very hard to do on a touch screen.  Also to turn while running you cannot slide your thumb to the side buttons to turn.  You can use a second finger to press the left or right buttons, and that makes the game at least playable. But I imagine that would be too difficult to do on an iPhone.  If they lengthened the double tap to run just a bit.. And made it so that the controls would let you turn with a single finger, then this port would be excellent. I still had  fun with it. This was probably the first survival horror game ever. And lead to the games like resident evil. "

I'm playing a perpetual night world where getting s full moon is a saving grace. And if you re-enter in the game to get the full moon effect, it doesn't go away after the full moon has past. So if wear pigs are chasing you, they never change back. I'm listing all the negatives here but I've played this game for many hours and enjoying it. Some cons I found:- Cooking and eating is tedious where it takes 5 actions to cook and eat something. And you must have an empty slot. - Hard to attack specific targets. I was attacking some hounds when they were attacking lightning goats. The attack button locked on the goat so both agroed on me. I had to book it out of there. - The build menu is a bit fiddly. Sometimes you can't collapse one section and expand another without exiting first. The game pauses when you open it so it's not a big deal.- Can't really multi task. While I was using the virtual joy stick, I wasn't able to open the map without stopping first. Not a big deal until you are being chaste by a wear pig and trying to find where the beefalo are on the map. The pig killed me because of it. I‚Äôm just going to keep this very brief. I‚Äôm writing this in the hopes that a developer somehow finds it. Although this game is amazing in every sense of the word And exactly my style...the thing that all of the internet and mostly reddit is complaining about is the fact that, if you were to try to play a song or a podcast of any kind while in the app it will stop your music and will not allow you to resume. It seems like a very small problem but to some it‚Äôs a rather big deal. The game is great and interesting, but once you know everything there is to know about the game, seen everything there is to see, and slain every beast possible, it gets boring. That‚Äôs just how all games are and there‚Äôs nothing can change it. But if you can listen to a podcast or entertainment of any kind, then the game once again becomes very useful. It will function as something for the eyes and hands to do while the ears are otherwise occupied. This not to say that the ambience, FX, and in-game music aren‚Äôt enough, it‚Äôs just that it gets repetitive and mind numbing after a while. So on behalf of me and the group of fans who love to play a relaxing game with entertaining audio media I ask that you change it. btw wasn‚Äôt as brief as I thought "

I will say that none of Gluten Free's games work on iPod 4 or lower, but that's as much as I know about compatibility. The noises could be better. The dragon's roar is just... AWFUL, and sounds like its roaring from its arse! As an example, Skyrim dragons have some wicked roars and such, but certainly don't copy off of them! And also, the family's a little glitchy. Like, when they are flying in your home even when they should be walking. Or flying on one of the islands when you are walking. I laugh when a sheep runs off their floating island to escape, just to fall to their death! It would nice if your loot could show up inside your house, like it should the way you have dragons. It would be cool if, when you defeated the ""Dragon King"" (inferior when you're at Lvl 50), you became the Dragon King. Or at least were dubbed as the Dragon King. Other then some other things that others could name, this game is worth the money! I love this game, I can sit around and play this game for hours, days, but there are some problems, When u buy the color white for ur flames, it still won't let u use it, and it says it's still locked, also, I don't think that the castle people, like the Knights, mages, and archers should attack u unless u attack them or the castle first, or roar. The roar is fine except it needs to sound deeper, not as high pitched as it is, and when ur  standing or flying, I don't like how the mate and the baby dragons r flying or standing on top of one another, same thing with the wolf game, also, why is the mate so much smaller than u, its just plan weird, this is an amazing game, but it does need some fixing, so please have an upgrade soon, I also think that there should be more levels, instead of just the one, and when u kill the dragon king, I think you should become the dragon king, the dragons face is shaped weird, but I love it to be honest, this game is worth the money but still, please fix it up üêâüòã‚ù§Ô∏èüòáüê≤ K, so my T-Rex family is level 32 and lower and my dragon family is capped at fifty. And I had the dragon game for less time. I do think there's a level imbalance here, I think exp for the dragons should be harder, treasure more challenging to get/prices higher or maybe make the game free so people can use this speedy ""sim"" to get a tantalizing taste of Gluten's games. Still has the white fire bug, but I don't even think I've had this game a week so I doubt it'd be fixed in that short of time. Though I'll still care for my dragon family (I'm the sort of dingus that gets attached to freakin' pixels), but now there's really no place to go with this so it's short lived, too fast or just empty. Would love to see more done with this. Maybe an achievement system. Kill Dragon King x amount of times, get his coloration for your dragon. Kill basilisk x times, get snake pattern armor. Etc. just something to add to this game. "

How fast you can level up with the right strategy is cool. There are a few problems though. The first one is how when you take your finger off the joystick, your animal stops. I like the idea but please make an option in the settings if you want that or not. The second problem is when a pterodactyl picks something up then drops it then goes on the ground to kill it, you can‚Äôt attack it for about 5 seconds. You just have your head on it forever waiting to hit it. Those are problems and I don‚Äôt like it. Here is a suggestion. Make cactus damage stop after pterodactyl. I know the bigger the pterodactyl, the less damage. But it‚Äôs annoying how it still hurts you. Make it so 1M xp+ means no damage from cacti. This game is awesome, but no game can be flawless. 4/5 until the problems are fixed First of all, the chat should just be removed because I got told by someone to commit suicide because they tried to kill me and I just went on the land and they couldn‚Äôt, second of all, eagles should not be able to drag predators. It‚Äôs clearly not fair because I was a tiger and a boa was chasing me. I had low health and some stupid eagle comes in and drags me into the boa which causes me to die. The worst part is that somehow, the eagle got the kill. ( I could tell because they immediately leveled up to crocodile and they were quite small, as if they just turned into eagle )The second reason why the chat should be removed is because there is cussing and people throw rude insults at me and other players, then kill me which makes me cry and think I‚Äôm hated by everyone. Now, I don‚Äôt think that there should be a giant gem in the lava. Why the lava? It just causes other people to burn and when they try to get out because the gem is gone, what‚Äôs the use because they‚Äôre obviously going to die. And there‚Äôs also glitches and hacks that people use to get lots of XP. Those should 100% be fixed. Next, there should be another animal after the Black Dragon. I really recommend this because I reached 18.2 million XP as a black dragon, but I honestly didn‚Äôt see the point since there isn‚Äôt anything after the black dragon. There is also a few bugs that should be fixed. This is game is really addictive and fun. There are some problems though. I think this game does NOT need curse words .People have said really mean things and curse words even though kids play this game! I've been called some really mean things. People also put bad words into their names. You should REALLY get rid of that! And what are these clan things like GD and N and Quad. I don't understand those. Curse words are really bad. Please restrict people from saying bad words! And, there is a glitch on mobile when the joystick freezes!!! It is super annoying. I got it once right when I got to kraken! I was killed by a pufferfish!!!! Why can't you fix that glitch!! It made me cry... This game has so many terrible glitches! Also please remove dragons and krakens and yetis to NOT be able to kill each other. Also lower the XP to get to black dragon. I've been Black dragon only ONCE. I tried SO HARD! And guess what? I was tail bit to death by a different black dragon! That's so STUPID! Why would they kill me? There's nothing after black dragon! And why are black dragons able to burn each other?! This game makes me so depressed... Why can't you fix ANY of these things! It's so STUPID! If I could give zero stars, I would. Please fix all these things. I would love for these to fixed and would give five stars. But for now, only one star. Fix these things!!!!!! "

It wasn‚Äôt like those games that ruins the first on. But one thing that they should try making better is the graphics, but they will not ruin the game for me. Normally I‚Äôm not the one who would complain about the graphics, but these where a understatement. Sometimes you wouldn‚Äôt even see the person but hear the talking, or the mouth would move but the chin would. And moving around, my goodness, they way that had it set up in the first one was amazing, with the joystick. But this one you have to tap where you want to make, it make it very difficult to play. Also the game just randomly crashes. And I would blame my iPad but my iPad is new and up to date. But otherwise the game is super super good and if have played the first one, you have to play this one!!! While I love the story, there are significant bugs which prevent me from giving this 5 stars. First, characters are frequently in the wrong locations during cutscenes and conversations, a dragonkin figure is not properly displayed, and David‚Ä¶ his jaw movements in episode 1 made him even scarier than he is. Then there‚Äôs the control scheme. I liked the scheme from the first Life is Strange, where one half of the screen controls the player character while the other half controls the camera, but you don‚Äôt have that option here. Tap to walk somewhere. If you miss the tap target to interact with something, you end up starting to walk away from it, which quickly got annoying. And I didn‚Äôt get far into episode 3 before it got crashier than I would have liked. Anyway, story gets 5 stars, but the lack of control scheme options, crashes, and bugs drop the overall rating to 3 stars. I loved the original Life Is Strange. With so many characters and settings, it was hard to get mad over the glitches. (Which there were very FEW of.) But this... This ruins the Life Is Strange feeling. The feeling I get from playing Life Is Strange is wonder. Like telltale games, I constantly wonder what is going to happen next. But with so many errors and mistakes in this game, it makes it hard to ignore them. Like with one section where David‚Äôs lips don‚Äôt move, yet his jaw moves up and down when he is speaking, and his skin glitches into his eyes! And when I‚Äôm in the car with William, It kicks me out of the game when he‚Äôs hit by the semi truck. This is not the Life is Strange I fell in love with, and I honesty regret buying this... I wasted 12 bucks on a game that doesn‚Äôt even work. Like in the title, this game had good potential, but sadly, it didn‚Äôt live up to my standards.

I was one of the few that bought PSII as a standalone app many, many moons ago. To have III & IV make a triumvirate is certainly awesome. But this is exactly what complicates the relationship between players and developers that bundle their works. Maybe we want one game without the others. Maybe we‚Äôre glad to have all this rare stuff in a nice little box. Newbies will love the price, but we who have already invested at least SOMETHING into this (US$2.99, I think it was) now need to invest just a little more. All told, it‚Äôs going to be about $8 for me, and that leaves a sour taste in the mouth, if you get where I am going.  Make the pricing less vague and split ‚Äòem up. Let Apple bundle things for you. They‚Äôre all good games. It‚Äôs a shame the series did not develop further as standalone console RPGs. Still a good buy and worth the pickup. This has been the best download for me during quarantine and great to relive the best of all RPG games... I completed IV and III and currently working on II. For anyone with issues on saving for PSII the trick is to save the game in the data center in the actual video game, and NOT use the top right hand save button that the app gives you... I was using the top right button at first which makes you wait the 30 seconds every time you do so and midway through the game it would freeze and stop working and reboot. I was devastated thinking I couldn‚Äôt continue this complex game without save but I tested and went to a data center in the actual game located in the town (the logo outside the building looks almost like a division sign with dot and lines)... save in the slot there and then once you exit and restart the game you can access it that way by clicking start when PSII comes up. IT WORKS and is better and faster than the app button which is faulty anyway. And when you are further into PSII and have Shir the thief steal the visaphone from the headquarters in Paseo once she is at level 10, this device lets you save ANYWHERE and at any point in the game and yes, it works!! You can thank me later!! Enjoy your playing! This app has brought back so many great memories of the late 80s and early 90s for me. Totally worth it for free but I would‚Äôve paid. It's hard to believe this game came out in 1989! Back then it was the largest cartridge game ever but memory was still a limitation so it came with a 100 page manual with maps, hints, descriptions of weapons, techniques, etc. The iOS port is pretty much an exact replica so I recommend finding that info on the web (unless you like frustration!) One cool addition is the cloud save feature which literally lets you save your game anywhere! I even saved the game during the closing credits! It's a good thing too as the regular 'data save' feature quit working about halfway through.  The most annoying thing was the control buttons blocking large portions of the screen. I didn't find out until my last day playing that you could adjust the opacity! Oh well... Another bug I found: whenever I tried to use the Neisword to return to Lutz, the game froze and I had to exit and restart from my last save. (I am on an iPad with 10.3.3). I just used Hinas to get back so it wasn't a big deal. Five stars to Sega for allowing me to relive a small portion of my youth! One more thing, I paid to remove the ads and there was only one Sega ad that would pop up when you first start the game. Not as annoying as the reviews led me to believe. "

It‚Äôs great fun and a great way to do some physical activity. I even purchased the full version not only to get the full features, but to support an amazing AR app. However, therein came the problem. Ground detection. Every time I play with the largest or sometimes even second largest field, every checkpoint I go through, no matter the mode, raises the spots, and has them float higher and higher, to the point where I can‚Äôt even see them. The same thing happens to the block enemies. I hope this gets fixed soon, because that‚Äôs my favorite mode. It adds a whole new layer of depth past just walking in a shape. This game gives you ways to run around your house while your family laughs. The game offers the wall punch mode we‚Äôre you can use your phone as your fist and puck simulated targets, or you can play the other default mode which lets you run in different ways. There is also a 2 dollar premium edition were you can try to run over as many dots as you can. Also you can run over as many dots as you can while blocks are chasing you. You can ALSO have a far distance mode:The game is very fun and give it a try. If you like it, premium is worth it:) I‚Äôve played this game on my sisters phone, but for some reason, when I try to play it on my phone, it says the camera isn‚Äôt on for it. I‚Äôve tried many ways to fix it, including: restarting my phone, going into settings and restarting the apps, getting on different WiFi‚Äôs and etc. Please Please Please fix this app so I can play on it, or suggest another way to play it.

But the storyline is over too soon. I got a new phone, redownloaded this app, and it's been less than a month and there's no story left (I play whenever there's a lull in the day). And I would've liked more weapons years ago. The minigun and striker are really the only fun and effective weapons to have. On my old phone, I hit level 50 and have been basically raking in money as gameplay. I've almost 6 million dollars and nothing to spend it on except the occasional health boost in the arena or a laser cutter for rare emergencies.Knives would be great, maybe a sword option, I like another commenter's idea about the flamethrower, a sawed-off shotgun, sniper rifle, any of these would work. This game is great, and that can be a problem for the developers because great games need maintenance. We all want an update. I've come to love the minor glitches and integrate 'em as part of the game, so I'm not really concerned about that as much as I am wanting more story and weapons. It's a good game, that's why we want more! Great App! One of the few games like it where one doesn't have to be a big spender to play. Highly recommend it for zombie themed FPS enthusiasts. While overall good gameplay, it's not without its flaws. Would give five star rating if not for one major glitch in the system. Something that could be fixed if one of two things were included in the update: The ability to interrupt the reloading process, or the option to disable said processe's automatic function. In the current version, reloading leaves player unfairly vulnerable to attack: Unable to switch weapons, or use items until the process is complete. Would be more efficient if player had the option to equip alternate weapon or utilize item instead of being forced to wait for current weapon to be reloaded once magazine is depleted. Being able to swap weapons or utilize items during automatic reload process would work as well. The trade-off of having to restart the entire automatic reload process when reequipping the weapon with the spent magazine would it be acceptable, as player would most likely be out of danger by then. Please consider for next update. I really was never into games. So I carefully read all the reviews and they are right very easy to play and a lot of free options to get gold and money for more equipment. I even got a new phone and that was the first thing I downloaded. And if you create an account you can pick up where you left off which is awesome cause I had more then 1000 in money and 300 in gold. Also they have great customer service when it comes to earning gold by downloading another app. I also love that option because most games say they are free and then turn around you get to a certain level and you have to play to continue. They also have many missions option that tell you if it‚Äôs easy or hard and they also give you a hint on which weapons are best. And they also have many equipment options and when it comes to guns they tell you how powerful it will be. I can go on and on I really love this game. "

But then I got up to the room with the security turrets at the lab and what was a puzzle/story/adventure game suddenly requires reflexes that I, someone with a joint disorder, just don‚Äôt have. I tried‚Äî for hours‚Äî to get past that scene, and I watched play throughs, and tried to do what those players did, and I simply physically can‚Äôt. Usually when I encounter a game that‚Äôs going to need fast, calculated motion, I know it in the first few minutes and can nope out. This reminds me a lot of Life Is Strange in that it‚Äôs a game that I was able to play almost to the end and am now stuck because it is asking me to do something that is a physically impossible for me.  If you‚Äôre going to create a game where one scene has a radically different gameplay style than the rest, PLEASE either warn up front or have a way for players like me who can‚Äôt play in that way to skip the outlier scene. It‚Äôs so frustrating to get so invested in a game and then have to just stop without getting to know how it ends because the developers didn‚Äôt think about disability access. While I too spun around awhile coming out of the apartment building I was able to get around the glitches and finish the game. This appears to be a new game. The story was entertaining and I definitely think that minor glitches in no way should depreciate the fact that this is a five star game. You can fix glitches but the story/game itself is top notch. To the devs, I use IPad Pro 1st gen. I was stuck a few times in the air ventilation room too. I was able to either shut down to get out or just happen to hit it right. It almost seemed that the exit was off screen. Had there been a place that allowed me to save it, Along with your auto save feature, then I wouldn‚Äôt have lost minor progress.  During the airborne sequence it seemed that I had no control at all, I kept smashing into things. Maybe I was supposed to but even when there appeared something at the bottom of the screen I didn‚Äôt get it. Perhaps it was just me. The gyroscope is definitely touchy. I learned to slow down to keep it from looping. I wish there was a way to be updated in the game with new chapters (like an update appears that gives you the opportunity to purchase new episodes) as I look forward to purchasing the next one.  I only comment on glitches for your information, habit from beta testing. Thanks for hours and hours of good/fun entertainment. I like this game a lot. However, I am playing on an iPad Air (first gen), and the game crashes at the end of nearly every chapter, forcing me to replay it. The second time through it seems to save progress normally. The crash always seems to happen after the shield symbol ‚Äústutters‚Äù the second time.Gameplay is great. I love the interface, and moving around is intuitive. I enjoy having to choose the answer at certain moments. "

However I saw pretty glowing reviews for it so I gave it a shot. At first, I wasn‚Äôt very impressed. Just walking around the woods staring at blank 360 pictures wasn‚Äôt doing a lot for me. But then I got to chapter 2 and that‚Äôs when the game really started piquing my interest. As I went on the game became very interesting and immersive. Especially wearing noise cancelling headphones. I wish there were more games like this to play on your phone for VR. Great game :) Quite a fantastic game! Tilting your cell phone around and panning for clues to move forward, just brilliant! Have not come a crossed a game quite like it before. The scenes are exceptionally well done. The mansion was awesome, just like those videos of people who search through real abandoned houses. The scenes are creepy and scary, keeps you on your toes waiting for something to happen. And it will, though much of it is psychological scares. It‚Äôs best to play with the lights off in the room your in. Makes it more like your really the one walking around seeing it through your cell phone. Very enjoyable game, would recommend this game for anyone who likes creepy, scary games. The only complaint I have is that the game ended too soon, I definitely wanted more!!! Maybe even finding a way to stop the occurrences and defeat the bad entity. Please create a part 2, I would definitely play it over and over again!!! Wow I‚Äôm amazed at this this was a perfect horror game it didn‚Äôt cross   the boundary‚Äôs which I liked, it pushed them no doubt but to a point where it was still fun. It also had a great story and it is so different the fact that you only can see in black and white for the main part and to the caricature of the game. Now hopefully the next game they make will be even better, and if I could meet the people who made this game, no!!, this other dimension. I would ask them if they could bring to life a true encounter that I experienced. "

He blew his whistle and said ‚Äúfreeze!‚Äù And then the game froze. I love the original Gold Rush. I installed this version on my iPad 3 and iPhone 6. It's really meant for larger screens. The controls are intuitive however your finger completely covers the control options and you need to blindly know what you're trying to do. I failed 20+ times in a row trying to drag my key to the proper spot on the gate. Text is tiny and almost unreadable. On the iPad 3 it was really laggy. Trying to drag items from inventory often result in dragging down the notification bar. I turned off the sound as the voice acting was horrendous. Flat characters that almost sound robotic. I can get past the voices but this really needs to be optimized for smaller screens. All that said, I'm still happy to have it. Gold Rush is always fun to play.Edit: taking away another star. The controls are awful. I keep wishing I was just playing the original. This release just isn't fun to play. Stay away at all cost.  Great graphics, great port; unfortunately, the game is impossible to play on iPhone.  Every time you go to use an item, the IOS pull down screen appears and the item becomes impossible to use.  There is no way you‚Äôre going to get anywhere in this game until they figure out another place to put the item menu.  It‚Äôs unfathomable to me that this bug made it through testing and still appears in the finished product.

‚ÄéPrimordia,"What happened to the humans? In a desolate, ruined world inhabited only by robots, the taciturn android Horatio searches for answers. Where did he come from? Where have all the humans gone? And what, if any, was his role in it? Torn from his peaceful existence in the crashed airship, the UNIIC, Horatio and his sarcastic floating friend Crispin are forced to travel to Metropolis, City of Glass and Light, to retrieve their stolen power core. What they discover there changes their understanding of the world and their place in it, for better or worse.     Full voice acting, featuring Logan Cunningham (the voice of Bastion) as Horatio. -- Reviews -- Adventure Gamers - ""Beautiful, surrealistic retro graphics; likeable characters and a deceptively sprawling plot."" 4/5 Eurogamer - ""Primordia is delightful, smart and packed with personality."" 7/10 Rock Paper Shotgun - ""A cast of thoroughly insane-in-the-short-circuited-membrane side characters keeps the ride nice and lively as well, complimenting the oppressively dreary setting with a strong mix of mystery driven drama, Old West frontier charm, and dark humor.""

Add to this no less than two disparate Messianic visions and your basic dystopic bargain, and you‚Äôve got a lot to reflect on by game‚Äôs end. The game mechanics are well planned too. While it is always possible to get to a good ending and a bad ending, choices made along throughout the game will determine whether you can get the best ending and the worst ending.  and puzzles drive most of the action, This game is amazing! The music ,art style , and voice acting mesh perfectly together to envelop you in the world if primordia. The somber tone and story elements reminded me a touch of blade runner. I defiantly recommend downloading it. My one critisim is that the controls are not immediately available they appear when you hover over a certain part of the screen you don't get a menu until you find your data pouch ,but I suppose that was intentional to give focus to the landscape of the scene. Overall great game 5 minutes into the game, and I already knew that I was in love. Crispin, your helper, is perfectly witty, and Horatio NullBuilt Version V, was intelligent and a deep character. Right away I was in love with the art, with the curiosity, and I could not bring myself to put the game down. It brought out so much raw emotion in me, and I fell in love over and over again. It was so worth buying, that words can't even begin to explain. The only issue is that it's impossible to get one achievement, but compared the wonder and joy I felt, that's nothing. "

It combines old fashioned turn based combat with new ""On the go"" technology that you can play anywhere! The story is flawless and I found myself falling in love with Cynthia. The character depth is amazing and I really felt their emotions.  I would pay anything for a sequel! Overall fun app. Haven't beat it yet working my way through to the overlords keep now.  Will say the touch controls could use better auto tracking but the on the fly controller switching in tight spots makes up for any tap to move issues.  Overall sound and story wins over this minor gameplay issue.  I will say a few things, the double confirm for sales is a bit stale and there is a scroll glitch in the special points shop but its nothing major as you will use shops maybe at most 8 times for weapons and armor and just max stack healing items once or twice.  The game has great difficulty in the beginning up towards mid game then with a few skills and the right orbs its easy to pull off massive damage at a huge risk in damage intake. Pretty balanced overall especially since getting closer to the overlord results in boss battles that need careful planning since super skills damage is no longer as effective with double damage setups.  Keep up the great publishing. "

That‚Äôs all the problems that I can think of as of right now, so please if you can fix this problems it would be great. I‚Äôve just started playing this game and it is amazing, the graphics and the amount of detail is just wow! It‚Äôs very competitive and you can really fully costume enjoy your character, the best part of this game is that not all the content is downloaded at once, I like how you have to download stuff because it make the game more smooth and it allows you to play online on hotspot! There‚Äôs a lot I like about this game and at this point I‚Äôm not having any issues with it but I keep seeing some reviews that are not so great. Keep up the good work! I would also like it if you added more game modes that would introduce the player to a whole other gameplay/game style like mini games such as Capture the Flag or 1v1 solo duel, game modes like that would really be enjoyable to the community, I would also like to point out your rewards because they‚Äôre awesome! Lucky royale and daily rewards are probably the best for beginners because it atleast gives good rewards to those who are not that good at the game, unlike fortnite that makes you Pay for their currencies, free fire has several different currencies that get you something u want and you don‚Äôt have to pay a single penny to earn, u can just earn the currencies by completing the game and just basically playing the game, I love this game and I would really hope there would be more updates to improve the game style because this game finally makes it fair to everyone with its currencies and gameplay! Edit: As mentioned below Ive lost interest. Its the same thing every game! Go on a kill streak, Game gets serious lag spike i die instantly, and then i level up and get gold but theres nothing to spend it on. Oh yeah and ever since i logged onto FB not only has connection been bad but i haven't been able to select load outs anymore.  This game is great but the worst of this game is the greed. :/ I know fashion has nothing to do with the game but everything costs diamond barely anything costs gold so once you play it just gets old cuz your not gaining anything from it and you cant get diamond unless you pay real money. So already you've rendered gold useless. Rather than making all the clothes and stuff cost diamonds make most stuff cost a lot of gold so people can be motivated to keep playing and all the rare and unique clothes and stuff can cost diamonds which you can get by competing in events and stuff or completing challenges/quests. Do that and I give 5 star. "

Better games to purchase. I'm so disappointed I purchased it. The inventory items are hard to place & sometimes almost impossible. It's hard to navigate using the map. The hint button is of no use as it won't circle or point to the area needing help. I can only hear it. The music is a little irritating, as well. But, maybe because I stay stuck in one place so long trying to place items where they should go. I can't say anything good because I'm so frustrated with it. Not worth your risk to even try!! Update!! Problems do not improve. I keep going back & I'm stuck. Hint button doesn't work so it's so frustrating. Wasted money! Wish there was a way to get credit for it. Please don't purchase!!

One year prior, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light. Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. And though the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of a great collapse. Although skeptical at first, this band of unlikely adventurers soon finds this chance encounter to be only the beginning of an adventure set to  not only change their lives, but their fates, as well. - Groundbreaking Visual Quality! Using the latest in visual expression capabilities for smartphones, the world of Asdivine has been rendered with stunning detail. From meandering clouds to lapping waves, sparkling magic to slithering creatures, and even dynamic skill effects, Asdivine Hearts breaks new ground in 2D turn-based RPGs! - Limitless Play and Loads of Content! By taking puzzle piece-like jewels and setting them in a box known as a ""rubix,"" players are able to customize characters in ways like never before! From having lighting-fast reflexes to berserker status, it is all possible with the power of a rubix! Moreover, with plenty of subquests and rare items to go around, there is never a reason to find yourself without something to do! And with a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to collect information for, there is always something to do for even the most casual and hardcore gamers. So how far can you level and how many millions of damage can you dish out? All these challenges await you and more! *This game features some in-app-purchase content. While in-app-purchase content requires additional fees, it is not necessary for finishing the game. *The actual price might differ depending on the region.",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple32/v4/92/50/b9/9250b975-0e1f-6621-aa17-591bb400201a/mzm.mjmajthz.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.7 ‚Ä¢ 58 Ratings,$7.99,,"October 26, 2015","Asdivine Hearts is one of the few Kemco games I've played and replayed. Exe-Create is easily Kemco's stand out development team (not to take anything away from their other development teams - they all bring their own thing to the table, which is incredibly impressive at this point in the retroRPG market), pretty much consistantly making enjoyable titles, but this one stands out as one of their best, self-released or published by another company...Definitely recommended I really enjoy this game. The music is catchy, battles are addictive. Story is sorta generic but funny. Only negative is the translation. Not a good job at all. Very awkward sentences and some that make no sense. Still, I'm able to follow the story and character personality still comes through. If you are looking for a classic style Jrpg then look no farther! "

My only complaint is that it is pretty short, and the storyline and characters are bland. It‚Äôs still a far better alternative than Bethesda‚Äôs latest mobile effort and can provide a scratch for those who get that itch. This is the second time I‚Äôve played through this game as well as purchased it.  As far as I‚Äôm concerned it‚Äôs the best out there on the mobile platform before when it was out and still now.  I‚Äôd love to see more games like it!!  Graphics are also awesome on my IPad Pro 12.9‚Äù 2018 device.  Please add controller/ game pad support.  One thing particular I don‚Äôt care for is when in first person camera view the shield or my character‚Äôs head covers the left bottom corner of the screen interfering with my nice view, please fix this.  I‚Äôd prefer nothing showing on the person.  I was thrilled to see this game back on and updated.  Keep up the awesome work!!!! This game can be confusing sometimes Like it doesn‚Äôt give you specific instructions on missions and where you should go instead you get to see a map which doesn‚Äôt help you at all and new locations will appear when you come close to them. Also this energy depletion runs out you can‚Äôt attack anymore which is annoying. "

Explore the cities and countryside of a vividly realized fictional version of the southwestern United States. You can tackle story-driven quests, gorge on fast food, outrun the police, or obey every traffic light‚Äîit‚Äôs up to you. This enormous game deftly displays Rockstar‚Äôs unique mastery of open-world design, and it never fails to entertain. Its a fantastic game, just like always. The controls are simple, but the storyline is complex, and great gameplay. Obviously, the graphics are top notch, but it makes up for it with storyline and gameplay. I love reading idiots who give it 1 star. No sound? probably because your device is horrendous. Bad controls? Check the settings. It honestly sounds like these people havent played a game in there life.Honestly, I cant complement this game enough. There are some missions that are hard, im looking at you, Wrong side of the tracks, but honestly, they are still fun. The side missions and things that you can do in San Andreas is epic. From getting haircuts, shopping for clothes, even being a paramedic! You can eat food and get fat, or work out and become strong. Or do both and become... Something. This game is one of the best, especially for mobile. I love this game, very fun, but there are a few glitches. The first one is on the robbery mission, sometimes when you get close to something CJ gets stuck on something and you can‚Äôt move which wakes up the person inside and then you get a 3 star wanted level. Another one is that the wrecking ball does not exist it is just a floating metal ball. Whenever I try to put a car in a garage it says you cannot store anymore vehicles in this garage even though my garage is completely empty and if I try to push my car in it will delete it. Another glitch I have experienced is that when I die during a gang war it gives the territory to me or it just removes it which I‚Äôm pretty sure is not supposed to happen. The last glitch happens on a date sometimes when you finish doing what she tells you to do instead of telling you to take her home, it doesn‚Äôt do that and when you do take her home you can‚Äôt drop her off, so you end up stuck with her and I have to restart the game. Also please put an option to disable tilt controls because I have to try to keep my iPad perfectly flat because if I don‚Äôt the car will pull to the other direction and it‚Äôs annoying. "

I downloaded the chapter 5 story and played through until the part where I‚Äôm trying to save Waller from joker in his little, ‚ÄúFun-House‚Äù and he sent his men after me as a distraction and it gave me two options that I could preform to take him down, neither of them would work, and then the guy would just shoot me down. I reset the game, powered off my phone completely, uninstalled the episode and played through it again, and it STILL won‚Äôt work. And now I‚Äôm trying to figure out what‚Äôs wrong, and could use some advice or maybe there‚Äôs a problem with the system?!I hope you guys can keep up the good work with Batman telltale, and please let me know what I should do or if there‚Äôs some kind of problem going on, thanks It‚Äôs the best Batman mobile experience your gonna get the whole story line is really great I even bought the season pack it was so good but I ran into a problem. I played episode 1-4 and it came to a point it said to purchase episode 5 and I swear I‚Äôm not lying I went to the store and it said the season pack was purchased. It made me really mad I reset the app moved it somewhere and it still made me purchase the season pack. So I wasted money trying to get episode 2-5 but I didn‚Äôt get same stitch. Made me really furious so I go check with my dad to make sure he bought me the season pack and he did it was a waist of $15. But it is a good game and all but come on man I wish I had episode 5 same stitch :( If you are making multi-platform games, then you should be targeting the screen sizes known to be used on those platforms. Sure Telltale‚Äôs first games were ports never intended for 4:3 screens, but at this point there is no excuse.Just to reiterate after the developer response. This game was created to only fit 16:9 screens despite Telltale knowing full well that it would be released on a plethora of platforms including mobile. Mobile phone manufacturers are not only pushing out a bunch of high end 18:9 screens but also have plenty of devices that use 4:3 screens. Not targeting these highly popular screen sizes shows a lack of polish to the game, and a lazy dev team that use an outdated and unwieldy engine. Why in the world should anyone pay the high price asked for this games when it doesn‚Äôt fit properly on their screen? Please stop releasing lazy ports and start developing properly for the whole range of devices you plan to sell your wares on.

But I actually really enjoyed this game! Both Survivalcraft games were really neat. But why does the full version cost $3.99? I understand this was a demo to lead players into the game, but what if someone really enjoyed the demo, and wanted to see more? Well, they couldn‚Äôt, cause the full game is $3.99! Still though, it‚Äôs probably worth your money.Also, there are some aspects I think you could add into the game:- So far, the only supernatural monster is a werewolf. And while that‚Äôs pretty cool, I think the game could some more monsters, like skeletons or vampires, or something along that line.- Why are those sailors leaving you on the island for good? I didn‚Äôt quite understand that part. Honestly, I think it would be cool if there were more of a story behind that. (Like, maybe you committed a crime and then the sailors had to exile you on a far-off island)- Maybe you could add villages dotted around the island, so that there are others that you can trade with and interact with.These are a few of my ideas; but overall the game is fun. Keep it up Candy Rufus! Ok, so please read this whole thing before you download. This is only a demo version. The real Survivalcraft is loads better. However, the full version is $3.99.   Yes, this only lets you play for one day, but look at the title people. This is so people can get a taste of the game before paying $4 for it. Candy Rufus Games is doing you a favor. Giving you a free sample, just a taste, to see if you like it before spending money. And people complain that it's only one day. Yeah, the demo is not as fun. I agree. But the fun version costs money! I'm sick and tired of people calling Survivalcraft a ripoff of Minecraft. Survivalcraft has much much more stuff, and is more realistic, you can freeze to death or get sick or run out of energy. Minecraft is for building. Survivalcraft is for SURVIVING. The full version of this game is so much fun! hey since I played survival craft back in the old days, I really hated it because I hate minecraft rip-offs. but when I started playing this for free in ios, [I used tutuapp to download but it has limited days so ya] I also watched your vids. but then I realized, man, this is the greatest game! but one day, I had to verify the app alot. so when I verified it, it eon't really verify. so please, if you're reading this, I just hope you made a free and full version of survival craft 2. everytime it won't verify, I had to delete and install, and delete, and install and.. forever and ever till' 2019. so if you see this, please please make survival craft 3 free!!! because alot of people wanted to see alot! only some of us raged because we waste money sometimes.. just please do it!

It would easily be a 5-star game if it didn‚Äôt have the technical problems; it really is wonderful in almost every way. Now to the only downside: because the game is a bit old, the controls can be very challenging. Here are a few tips for how to have the highest success rate possible for the controls:- When dragging an item from inventory, wait for the name of the object you‚Äôre dragging towards to appear before releasing- If the character doesn‚Äôt comment on your attempt in some way then the drag did not work ‚Äî try again- Sometimes you just get a ‚Äúbad drag.‚Äù It‚Äôs usually easier to try again than to keep dragging the object around for too long looking for the item name‚Äôs pop-up- Finally: don‚Äôt be too ashamed to use the tips. Some scenes seem a bit buggier and harder to explore than others. I still had fun while occasionally using tips to help me along so I didn‚Äôt keep trying to drag something that wasn‚Äôt going to work anyhow. Somehow this was particularly true for me in the very last scene of the game. Yeah, the controls are buggy, but you get used to them. If anything, I found the first chapter the most difficult and it got much easier from there. I finished the game despite the tough controls and it was very much worth it. :) Excellent game definitely one of my favorites I‚Äôve played on IOS. There is an issue they‚Äôre aware of within saving the game, they are aware of the issue and I hope trying to fix it. The is a function under tools called wishingwell2.0 you I put a command which is: startchapter#   and will start you at the beginning of the chapter. I had the above problem and emailed there support team, it took them about a day and a half to get back to me according to my email it came in pretty late/early in the morning because I believe they‚Äôre from Germany, at least I know this game was like #1 Germany, game is completely in English though. I really look forward to completing this game it‚Äôs super awesome and really addictive. The players aren‚Äôt 2 dimensional except for the visual part, and at least I really grew to care about them as characters in an awesome game! I can‚Äôt wait to play again and go on to buy the next game The Inner Worlds 2. The Inner World is an incredibly creative and original game. The gameplay is (mostly) intuitive, and the puzzles are just the right amount of challenging. But the writing is where it really shines. The storyline is engaging; the writing is witty, funny, tender, and never dull. There‚Äôs a ton of dialogue, making the NPCs endlessly entertaining. Every character is fleshed out, and you‚Äôll find the most interesting people in the most unexpected places.I would easily have given this 5 stars, except for one major issue: the hint system doesn‚Äôt work at all. I can see how it‚Äôs supposed to work, but it just... doesn‚Äôt. You click on things and nothing happens.

I've read every single choice of games book on the App Store, (except for that one about being an iron atom. I mean, what?) and this is most definitely the best one I've had the pleasure of ""playing"" coming in atop my former favorites, tin star and the heroes rise trilogy. This book delivered. I felt for the characters. I wanted to be there to comfort hatch, or lay a friendly hand on the ronin's shoulder when he was feeling overwhelmed. I enjoyed the dichotomy between the first book, which focused more on violence and swordplay, and this one, more attuned to the intellectual pursuits available in hyuga. Also, the last supper, Mona Lisa, and roof of the cistine chapel inclusions were much appreciated. I truly cannot wait until the third installment. I liked the emphasis on the character interactions, the depth one can see play out without needing the action to carry the plot along. I can respect that. The feel for established characters was there, the conflict and tension rising from the start and middle were great... Then it just took a turn for the strange that outright derailed it. One minute it is clear cut, next minute it's referencing something akin to inception in absurd ways that I felt hurt the story. I didn't enjoy the second half of the story due to how it went from character building, to questioning the characters roles in the story altogether, to a completely different story entirely that only referenced what was the original story. I loved the first Samurai of Hyuuga book, and I've replayed it many times. This book just felt like it was dragging its feet halfway through, tripped, and crawled towards the end with parallels to fantasy island as its crutch. Maybe I grew too fond to the flow of the previous books plot, but this felt hollow by the finish. I‚Äôve never cared to write a review before but... the tone and writing is as good as the first. However it feels as if we are restricted to the choices we‚Äôve made based on our stats. Now each choice isn‚Äôt clear in which your atunement is raised or lowered. It kind of bugged me as I wanted to diversify my character from book one, it was a bit frustrating having want to open up to my motley crew but feeling as if i wasnt supposed to. As character development is something every story should have.Now i dont really agree with other criticisms when we move onto the island. I feel like it‚Äôs a welcome addition, there are supposed to be supernatural elements that tug and mislead your path as the oni of greed tried to do in the first. I think if you really liked the first book definitely consider reading this one. I was only annoyed with the atunement stats, and that I had to take to google for a particular segment (one involving a japanese board game). This book is all about the aftermath after a storm with an exciting beginning and another storm brewing towards the end. Im hoping book 3 holds up considering the positive reviews. Definite props to the author. "

At first I was skeptical about downloading the app because there are so many interactive stories out there now and I‚Äôve downloaded almost all of them, so I can honestly say that this app has by far been my utmost favorite! Other apps make you wait a certain amount of time until you have more ‚Äútickets‚Äù to read, so when I saw they have a star tree that lets you gather more quickly and that they give you access to one story per day, to read for up to 4 days for free, I almost had a heart attack! I hate waiting in anticipation to gather up enough tickets (or in this apps case, Stars) in order to continue the story line, so this app has been like a dream for me! As long as I get access to one story a day and then use my stars for another I‚Äôm all set! Of course everyone loves animations, but I am content with the little breathing animations they give the characters that make them breath off the page. Anything more than that and I feel like I‚Äôd rather just watch an anime at that point. Anyway, sorry for the long review but I just couldn‚Äôt hold back how happy I was about the quality of this app and I needed to share! Wish the app makers would consider their readers value more seriously!!! The choices that cost gems for one are extremely high costing and not to mention within one single chapter the amount of times they want you to make that costly choice is ridiculous then on top of it clothing and hair that‚Äôs very high priced ...30 gems??? That‚Äôs straight ridiculous. The free choice of clothing is always something stupid like baggy sweats or overalls or baggy dirty clothing but yet in the story they will claim it‚Äôs a dress it‚Äôs stupid if the story says a dress then make the clothing fit the description and that stuff should be free seeing how it‚Äôs wrote about! The visual should match the description or else what‚Äôs the dang point?? We want attractive characters and to see what the story is saying so it makes sense!! Not to mention we barely get any videos an with it one single gem when everything is always like 17-30 gems!!! To even purchase gems you would need more than $100 to be able to choose the choices you want per chapter! Now that‚Äôs ridiculous and highway robbery these people only seem to care about taking money from people I swear then they don‚Äôt have many decent ways for you to earn things they also need to speed up the stars tree cause that‚Äôs also ridiculous! If you want a better app check out chapters they give way more free gems and multiple per video and have many other ways to earn gems and have better free stuff The other day I wrote a great long review on this app/game. I gave the reasons I loved the app and then rated it on different scales ect so I won‚Äôt go into detail on that again. However, I wasn‚Äôt sure where I could write this small complaint so here I am again. There is a slot machine game within the app and when you play the slots you pay 10 diamonds each time in hopes of winning large amounts of diamonds or various others wins. As for me I played this many times and have spent tons and tons of diamonds trying to win characters, diamonds ect. Anyway 3 times now I‚Äôve played the slots and won 100 diamonds each. I was unber excited however my winnings never showed or came to me in my diamond bank. This is very disappointing due to the fact I love the game and I love the slot machine concept. Though I‚Äôm sure you can imagine how frustrating this is to spend real money on diamonds, play the game win and not get your winnings. That‚Äôs 300 diamonds Worth that I‚Äôve lost out on. Among the many dollars I‚Äôve spent on this game buying diamonds to play with. Not to mention the hours of playing and getting daily wins ect.This will not stop me from playing the game however it will stop me from playing the slots game and spending unnecessary money on the app. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è "

I will give it a very much deserved 5 stars!I have been playing this game for several weeks now and so far it is awesome!The game has an option built in that if you die, you start from the previous day but the negative effects are gone and if you die 3 times, you can request one of 3 help crates, Food, resources or weapons. This game is by far one of the better games you can find in the App Store. I would like to encourage the developers to make more games like this one. I really like this game compared to others I played because your not thrusted into difficulty so quick. Areas that are easier allow you to build resources but its up to you who you use them to help further you in the game to more difficult challenges. The only drawbacks in the games is the controls which seem cumbersome, theres some in-game bugs. And the English text dialogue could use some work. We are glad you like our game.

This happens a lot. The word does not match what the player is looking for. Ive lived all over the world and im pretty sure casket never means toolbox. But the i spy aspect is tricky enough to be difficult and keep you playing. So if a non english speaker made the word list- maybe get someone to help you redo it. Its beyond annoying. I have to use up my hints just to figure out what the heck a word refers to!! A tap? A shoe? What? What is a tap? Oh. A spigot. Aha. Tap. Or a tray? Looked like a medallion/shield/ anything but a tray. Just saying. Redo the wording and 5 stars. Everything else. Great. This is another fun HO game from Crisp. I‚Äôll be sad when I‚Äôve played all their HO games. At first, I thought this was going to be an easy game and was ready to pass but as you go through levels it becomes quite challenging. 5 stars are for this game and if I could rate the ad content it would be  1. I don‚Äôt mind ads yet what I do mind is redundant ads. While playing, the same ad played over and over. This gets very annoying. Additionally, you can‚Äôt X out the ad you have to watch the entire ad and it‚Äôs not the usual short ads that Crisp uses. This would make a more pleasurable game if the developers switched up the ad content. Don‚Äôt bypass playing based on my ad dislike as this is a great HO game. I really like this game a lot. However it seems really really are stupid (i‚Äôm sorry I just couldn‚Äôt think of a diplomatic word to replace stupid). In between every game there is an advertisement for Homescapes. I‚Äôve probably seen that 30 second video Hundreds of times. Never, ever a new video, always the same thing. Now guys if I haven‚Äôt downloaded that game yet, chances are about 0% that I‚Äôm going to. I do download new games from these advertisements from time to time. That is how I ended it with your game. But this particular redundant of replaying it over and over and over is just annoying. Don‚Äôt you have anything else that would be of interest to people? At any rate, I hope to see a change. Really sorry to hear that :( If fact it's '3rd party' advertising and we have a very little control over what they show. Our game is really free - you could play all the scenes without any additional purchases and the advertising is our monetization. Though we are going to make our best to exclude such repeating ads.  As an option for $0.99 you could remove all and any ads forever. Thank you for the feedback! "

It got worse the longer you played the game. I‚Äôm currently on an iPad Air 2 running the latest iOS as of writing this review. There‚Äôs also a few texture bugs where sometimes things would turn into weird gray squares, but they're nothing game breaking. Gun controls could be better as well, but they‚Äôre enjoyable for the most part. The game gets a bit repetitive the more you play it too. But besides all that, it‚Äôs a solid and fun game. Interesting story and characters, nice soundtrack (although there‚Äôs only 4-5 songs per station), decent graphics for a mobile game, fun gameplay, and plenty of things to do besides missions. Be warned, though. The game has definitely showed it‚Äôs age. Overall a solid purchase and I‚Äôm happy. I just finished the main story and got everything I wanted to do done. Go ahead and buy it! I think it‚Äôs worth it. So I have been playing the game for 3 hours on and off and I noticed a couple of things you can't do. You can't do drive-by shooting and you can't aim wherever you want when shooting people. It was kind of a let down even though those are minor flaws. I'd love to see a update in the future where these two things might be addressed. Other than that, the game is amazing. Oh and it'd be neat if there was a way to enter codes to access all weapons, armor and to be able to drive the tank. Update: if you could make this game full screen and fix the bugs that are making it freeze up that would be great. I noticed GTA Vice City got an update and it looks way better in full screen for iPhone XS Max There once was an awesome review I spent probably 30 mins typing. Then I hit cancel instead of send. *palm to the forehead* ...almost drops phone and swipes on screen nearly deleting this.. #epicfail         This game is a classic piece of moving art. If you don't like it, Don't play it. If you only game on your phone and this is your first time, don't download; You're not worthy. Pros: Enhanced graphics. from original PS2 and PC versions. (Lighting slightly off on mobile version)     Smooth frame rate.            I originally played this on my iPod 4th gen with Retina display 32 gb and was greatly impressed by how smooth the game ran. (Of course, once support of devices with iOS 6.0 stopped, the game became choppier) it runs like a charm on my iPhone SE as of now.     Thrilling Storyline. I'm sure you've played this before, if you haven't. Don't download it, remember??? You're not worthy!! (Haha)    Easy Controls.Sure it may be slightly complex at times.

Your fingers are covering up most of the screen...be thankful we live in a time that you can play, what was once a home console video game, on your cell phone!!

The leveling is hard enough to get you an amazing feel of challenge but at the same time not give you a sense of frustration. This game is what most other games fail to accomplish: a perfect balance. The hidden weapons and trinkets are hard enough to take you some time to find them but not placed in an impossible place. I only ever had to look up at ONE hidden trinket. I chose a balanced set for my skills. Meaning that I wasn‚Äôt putting ALL or most of my skill points on attack or health. Even with that I still was progressing normally and with a healthy amount of difficulty. All of the bosses had fair attacks and phases to the point that if you died it was more of bad planning on your part than bad/faulty programming. The best part of this game though, is that it never forces you to continue on the main storyline. You always have the option to spend hours leveling up or looking for hidden stuff as you try to 100% the game. All of that makes for one hell of a game for traveling or waiting for a class to start, as you will be spending hours piecing together the lore, or just leveling up until you are one-hit killing bosses. Definitely a must have game on any phone! I hate writing reviews but I‚Äôm so impressed with this release that I feel it‚Äôs my duty as an avid gamer to do so.....sooooo here it goes-if the castlevania/Metroid genre ( admittedly more the first than the latter) had a baby with a fine tuned rpg,then ud have this game.  Everything-literally,graphics,gameplay,story,overall execution,etc are done near flawlessly, 5 star all the way, if u,like myself have wished for a castlevania release on IOS,well then like myself ur gonna have to keep on waiting......BUT if ur down with the next best and in some respects better thing then GET THIS GAME....u will not regret itPost edit:had the game for a few days now and all I can say over and over and over is WOW just simply WOW....I from the bottoms of my heart wish u guys win some kind of game of the year award....it would take me multiples of multiples of paragraphs to do this game justice......This game is 100% worth double the asking price.....and this last bit is real talk-just to the devs: PLEASE keep making games,please,Grimvalor is an example of everything IOS gaming can and should b,u kno what I‚Äôm talking about and from one fan of tru gaming to a a group of who I can only assume is made up of the same-congrats-this game will go down as one of the best on this platform First let me start by saying that the 2D and 2.5D Castlevania games are my favorite games and have been for over 25 years!  With that being said, this is not a Castlevania game, but it in the same style of a Castlevania game, closest I‚Äôve seen yet on IOS.  The graphics are great, the sound experience and music fits the game really well, and the controls, once you get used to them, actually work rather well.  It took me a little to master (or try to master) the controls, especially some of the special moves, but lots of practice and I actually like the control system.  Of course, I‚Äôd rather play with a controller and always will prefer a controller.  The gameplay is fun, challenging yet not too difficult as in the early Castlevania games, the save points are strategically placed, and I really enjoyed the story!  One of the best action platformers with RPG elements that I‚Äôve played on IOS and I‚Äôve been playing IOS games for over 8 years now.  I look forward to this company‚Äôs next game, and would ask for some possible DLC such as new levels/areas and perhaps stronger weapons.  Excellent game for the money, highly recommend!

I‚Äôve played many point and click adventure games and I must say this is in my top 5! The graphics are great, the storyline is interesting and easy to follow. I liked that most steps to be taken were logical and I only got really stuck a couple times, however, there is a help guide in the game that will give you just enough to get past the section you may be stuck without ruining anything else. I‚Äôve already downloaded the 2nd installment and can‚Äôt wait to start playing! I had been enjoying this game very much (love the mystery plot line and the graphics), although not as much as as the Syberia series, which is why I bought this game‚Äîbecause it was somewhat similar to it‚Äîbut I got stuck early on, because an obvious glitch.  At some point, you need water to combine with plaster in a bowl if you want to advance in the game, but the item is nowhere to be found in any of the screens. I can‚Äôt proceed and I don‚Äôt want to go back to the beginning of the game to start over again in the hope that the glitch has been solved with the newest update. It‚Äôs very frustrating. I hope the developer solves this problem. Otherwise, I cannot recommend this game. I absolutely love everything about this game. From the storyline, to the graphics and all the different scenes...by the way, there‚Äôs a lot of them....all the puzzles and things you need to do to move on, combine and build and even the voices. Truly, this game rocks, I was never bored and have played again and again. It‚Äôs pretty long, which I absolutely love and takes quite awhile to finish n most definitely a brain teaser...worth every penny plus more! Highly recommend. "

The reason I can‚Äôt give it a 5 star is that I‚Äôm on level 17 and I‚Äôm trying to expand my buildings and EVERYTHING needs lumber. Well to make lumber, you need saw blades. The only problem is that you can only get saw blades by completing special orders on the order board or occasionally you will get them as a gift. The annoying thing about the order board is that you complete an order and get the saw blade and it doesn‚Äôt replace it with another order that you can complete to get more saw blades. You have to complete multiple other orders before you even have a chance to get more saw blades and since you‚Äôve gotten to a higher level, the orders take a long time to complete. It really slows down the game! I wish there were a faster way to get saw blades. It would make the game a 5 star instead of 4 star in my mind! Game is really cool but the lag time is horrible. Many times when energy sources mature you don‚Äôt get your energy and same goes for the animals and factories. I won‚Äôt be spending anymore money until these issues are fixed. I don‚Äôt mind dropping some cash to play the game but if I don‚Äôt get my supplements it‚Äôs a waste of money. When messaging the help center they basically said they are to far away and working on it. They didn‚Äôt even give me anything back that I spent or reimburse me for the lost items I never got to collect. Horrible customer service, if you want your customers to spend money be sure you can deliver.UPDATE-looks like the developers found the problem, I was re-notified after a few weeks of the complaint that they see the issue and told me to stop playing for now. I did not respond. After 5 min they said they fixed the problem and issued me a credit for some energy. Very COOL of them and I‚Äôm happy with the response! Like I said before I don‚Äôt mind dropping money on an app game, back in the day I would spend $50-$70 on a new console game that had an ending. These new app games have continued play time so dropping a few buck to play is like a fart in the wind when the game plays correctly and customer service understands when things go wrong! On the plus side, it is easier to play then Klondike. It‚Äôs easier to get things to renew energy. But on the minus side it is much harder to get resources. Selling things on the order board to the captain, who comes up about 10% of the orders, gives you additional supplies such as saws, hammers, and trowels. These are necessary to finish factories and make items in those factories. The problem is we don‚Äôt get enough of those items and if you don‚Äôt get those items you can‚Äôt make the factories to make items to progress forward. Even when you do make the factories, many items that are made in the factories require these three items. There is a way out of it though: using real money to buy rubies so you can purchase these items. I‚Äôm not talking about just a few items I‚Äôm talking about dozens and dozens, so we‚Äôre talking about lots and lots of money. I don‚Äôt mind spending some money on a game, especially when it‚Äôs fun like this, but this is not realistic. The developers need to fix this. If they do I will give this game five stars. "

And it definitely took more than an hour, but still shorter than I‚Äôd like.I wish there was a little less hand-holding, the notes throughout the game gave you answers to every puzzle/lock. Well done game, good creepy atmosphere, but as mentioned, too short. About an hour play timeüôÅ I have been dreaming about a pack like this. Just for $15 you get endless entertainment. I am a fan of adventure games and tried all of them out there and I can say that these 5 games in the bundle are just awesome I bought this game even when it did not come with hints. I painstakingly played it all the way towards the end without complaining or going online for walkthrough, only to be stuck in the final puzzle (in the chapel) that seems impossible to complete; it was like the rubics cube concept. I bought this game to while away my time and to have fun in the process, not to wipe away my patience and be aggravated in the end. I do not recommend this game to anyone. "
‚ÄéDark Fear,"*** WARNING: This game contains frightening scenes which some players may find disturbing! *** *** MEDIA REVIEWS: Toucharcade - 90% / Gamezebo - 90% / Appgamer - 100% *** NOTE: If the game ""hangs"" at the blacksmith it's usually due to low-resource issues on your device. Try shutting down all background apps and freeing up some space before restarting your device. This should help fix the issue.  For the best experience we recommend you play Dark Fear on an iPad with a decent pair of headphones. DESCRIPTION You wake up in pitch blackness. You have no idea who you are, where you are or how you got here - it's up to you to figure it out!  For horror game fans seeking out that ultimate fix, 'Dark Fear' delivers an immersive, frightening experience wrapped in a cinematic soundtrack and a dark, twisted storyline written by an ex-film industry professional. The game can only described as blend between RPG and adventure with a 2D graphical style similar to the classic PC games from the 1980s (think Myst meets Kings Quest). Its simplistic approach allows even the most casual gamers to gently unfold and enjoy its many complex layers of game mechanics. Explore a diverse landscape filled with forests, mountains, lakes and deserts. Make allies in the local village, upgrade your weapon and armor, go hunting/fishing and fight your way to the truth by slaying your foes, solving puzzles and helping people with their problems.

I rarely give 5 star reviews, this one definitely deserves it. I think maybe people are put off by the old-style pixelated graphics, but that is a big mistake. Especially if you are looking for a good adventure game that is also quite scary! I was surprised that a pixelated-style graphics game could be scary at all, but it certainly delivers. If the graphics were more realistic, it would've probably been too scary for me. It was just right. And I can't think of a thing to criticize about it, just like another great game, The Room. This game was fun, definitely worth the price, and I hope it gets more attention so this developer will hopefully make more super-enjoyable games. :) This game is incredible. I read the reviews and wondered why they were praising this relatively unknown game so much. Figured it was worth a try and I was not disappointed! The soundtrack is gorgeous, there are legitimate jump scares and creepy characters/landscapes. The puzzles are relatively easy but the storyline keeps you interested and engaged. I can not recommend this game more highly if you love adventure games. Where has this game been hiding, and WHY isn't it among Apple's best of the best?!? Despite the retro graphics, the game has exceptional gameplay, story, and soundtrack, and is even creepier than a lot of higher end games out there. Well worth the money you'd otherwise spend on a cheeseburger, and way more satisfying!Would love to see a sequel. "

I liked this game so much, i still remember how it visually looked, and it was so gorgeous! It was so amazing, so pretty! This game is no closer to it. For example the very start of it. Like what the heck, this is a forest theme, why you gotta put an anime girl beside? I am saying that the visuals of this game got SO SO SO SO much worse. But, while you play, it looks exactly like the one that was in the past, and reminds me of the good memories i had from this game in the past.I am just a little dissapointed that the visuals of the game changed so much, that was pretty much the reason me and my mum downloaded it. Very similar to Zumba‚Äôs Revenge which I was excited for, but this is disappointing.There is no way to change the color of the ball you‚Äôre about to shoot to the next color. The aiming ‚Äúbonus‚Äù is useless since it just shoots the ball wherever you tap the screen. Also, the unnecessary anime girl standing by the sign after every level has absolutely nothing to do with the game. An ad after every single level with no option to remove them is also undesirable. There‚Äôs no way to save your progress, though it‚Äôs unnecessary because you‚Äôre basically playing the same 5 or so levels over and over and over.

I spent a good 10 minutes trying to exit the kickstand bar at the beginning of the game, old mine road (more specifically, the highway) just simply will go black sometimes or not have a character sprite. The cutscenes are very easy to accidentally skip, you might have to restart the game to be able to exit an area and sometimes that doesn‚Äôt even work, currently, I am incapable of moving forward from the minefield because the exit button does not work.It‚Äôs still the game it was in 1995 and with the remastered version, the art is well updated, but I don‚Äôt recommend playing it on iOS, get it on your PC or Ps4, it‚Äôs not worth the frustration here.To sum up, don‚Äôt buy it on your phone/tablet until the developers have fixed it.It‚Äôs a shame I have to leave 3 stars on a good game. I'm writing this review from someone who grew up in this era but never played FT before. And was extremely apprehensive to purchase due to the negative Old Mine Rd bug. Didn't want to buy and get stuck but figured during the app sale to take a flyer. Glad I did...I'm using a mini iPad 4. Since I never played before I finally got to the Mine Rd spot. I spent many do overs and probably played that area for an hour and not once did I experience any problems. Nor did I have any issues controlling the bike at all. I never crashed it during that hr. I just didn't know how to beat the different bikers with what type of weapon. The controls at the destruction derby are whacked... that is until you figure it out. It took a long time but instead of trying to control the left and right side of the screen, just touch your car, keep your finger on the screen and drag your car as if you're tracing a path!  Spoiler alert- then you can jump on the orange car easily and push it onto and off the second ramp.  You don't even need to be precise for the cutscenes to happen. I've been using a walk through up to that point to see if I could do it but alas sorta had to cheat. Been a good experience so far. I'm about 85% done. I think Grim Fandgo is the best, followed by Day of Tentacle then Full Throttle. But that's my opinion. Don't let the bug comments stop you at least for a mini iPad 4. I loved Full Throttle when I first played it in 1995 and still consider it to be my favorite adventure game. Many of the best LucasArts games from that era have been remade for iOS and I've been pleased by all of them, especially Monkey Island 2 and Grim Fandango. But this might be the best! The new, redrawn artwork is HD but somehow looks exactly like the original low resolution graphics in that nothing was materially changed, just smoothed and filled out. The audio is far better now (I never realized how low fidelity it was!) and the bonus features are super fun for ""old"" fans like me. Only complaint is that it's too easy to accidentally skip cutscenes. Maybe this should have an ""Are you sure?"" nag prompt before proceeding with the skip.*** Update ***I happily got through the game to the point where I enter the Old Mine Road on an iPhone 8 and it crashes every time I‚Äôm approaching Father Torque. I can‚Äôt continue the game. It reminds me of the game crashes I had on my 486 computer in 1995 at this very same part of the game, which I was able to solve with a driver update or something.

Just a few things I‚Äôd love to see: 1. Can you please move the boosters from the lower part of the screen? As a right-handed person, I keep pushing them on accident as I‚Äôm trying to move my character around the screen. My husband (a lefty) had the same problem when they were on the left part of the screen. Very, very frustrating! Move them some where in the upper half of the screen, please! (I‚Äôm begging you!üôèüèª) 2. Maybe there could be a special level available once in a while to help gamers collect the iron and red gems needed to upgrade the stronghold?3. I love trying to achieve the various characters! If you‚Äôre ever looking for new characters ideas, might I suggest you turn to mythology and the plethora of gods there. You could use some thing from each of their personalities as their special gift (e.g. lighting for Zeus, a war hammer for Thor, sunburst for Apollo, etc.) A new update came out today in the game removing the keys to open the chests, y‚Äôall gave us credit for the keys that we had and not the chests. I had over 40 normal chests and at least 2 Epic chests that I‚Äôve been trying to open, since removing the keys I just lost out on A LOT of iron, character tokens, and lots of other things. I am very upset that you guys cheated us out of the credit of those chests. It took lots of hours of game play to achieve those chests and just like that you removed them from my inventory. If I don‚Äôt get credit for those chests, I will delete this game. I have shared this game with a number of friends including my Fianc√© and they are all upset with this update as well. If this matter is not fixed or dealt with, we will all stop playing this game. It frustrates me because this was my favorite game but every time you do a new update I get cheated in a different way all the time. SoMerging needs to be done about this. Now anytime I try to watch an ad to open the video boxes the game freezes and the only way to fix it you have to leave the game, resulting in the loss of a life, many of the ads do this at the beginning at the game resulting in the loss of an additional life lost. This game seems to have more cheats and problems then the game is even worth playing. This game is no longer worth my time or effort if it‚Äôs always going to result in unhappy players! I spent a metric BUTTLOAD of time playing this game back when it was in Ye Olden Days‚Äîyou only had 3 lives, you regained one every 30 minutes, and your only objective was to find gems. You didn‚Äôt have to go to a goblin to cash in on your gems; if you died, they were still yours. Everything was perfect like that‚ÄîI enjoyed the simplicity, so I worked my way up to level 176. I completed the tasks for rebuilding the village to the max and just kept the extra stars I had in hopes that one day there‚Äôd be more tasks to spend them on. My pickaxe had nearly THREE HUNDRED hits. I even unlocked ALL of the little characters. I was having a blast‚Äîand then I took a break to spend time with my family after my brother went off to college and we had a series of hiccups in the family. Things died down and so, I finally came back...only to find all of my self-described accomplishments blown to BITS. Stars lost! Pickaxe at 30 hits! No characters! I have to talk to a goblin every two minutes or I lose everything! And all I got in compensation was a bunch of gold coins that I don‚Äôt even know the purpose of. I understand the revamp and I‚Äôm happy YOU like it,  but I‚Äôm just here to tell you that at LEAST one person absolutely hates it. I played this app for so long and all I got out of it was the developers spitting in my mouth. My disappointment is immeasurable. "

I redownloaded it recently not realizing it was the same game and this time around I really enjoy it. I‚Äôm not very far into it yet but the only thing I‚Äôm not really fond of is the way of gaining stars. I don‚Äôt mind the way of playing the folder multiple times gives you a star each time and it‚Äôs not dependent on how many moves remain. But what I don‚Äôt enjoy too much is the actual like connect the dots game on how you gain stars. I don‚Äôt know if maybe there are different ones the further into the game you get but I fear if it‚Äôs just the little color matching game the entire way through I‚Äôll get bored quickly. And I enjoy the storyline too much to just give up. But I really hope there‚Äôs more types of mini games to gain stars later on. Do you enjoy watching thrillers or crime investigations? Do you enjoy reading about investigations? What about that feeling of suspense that puts you on the edge of your seat?Then this game just might be for you! I can‚Äôt express it enough how much I enjoy this game! It‚Äôs so realistic, and captures the reader‚Äôs attention as if you are actually having these conversations. I feel like I am actually a part of the storyline, at times I forget that these aren‚Äôt real people or real conversations. I wish there was an option to change your gender and name. I feel like if I could change it to my gender and my name, it would feel more realistic. Aside from that, I really enjoy this game and I just started playing today. I get so into these conversations and once I run out of stars, I want to continue getting more stars so I can continue playing. I still cannot believe how realistic it is. From the texting, the photos, videos, documents you send, and the phone calls! It‚Äôs currently my favorite mobile phone game! I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in games where you can make choices, and see how the story ends up. I have three children and hardly ever get some time to myself. Playing this game is a nice way for me to relax and decompress at the end of the day. I waited a long time to write a review and I usually don‚Äôt review games. This game has an amazing concept. Love the story line- I don‚Äôt even mind the mini games yet- however they are very hard. I have been stuck on level 23 for a while and still need another star to progress. A few suggestions - have daily deals on coins half off or small packs like unlimited lives for 2 hours plus 50 gold and a few boosts for 5 bucks etc. it would make all the difference. I also obviously haven‚Äôt beaten the game yet but i did see from someone else that after you complete this story, there is no more. I am very sad about that. If developers chose to add another story- please restart the levels as they get so hard it would be impossible to continue. I also wouldn‚Äôt mind the mini games being a bit more game related. Like maybe connect the colored squares to find clues in a crime scene picture, or just show us a picture and have us solve the crime based off of it etc. I really love the concept of this game but really would like a little more.

Is it a commentary on the fragile nature of trust and human connection? A scathing critique of our blind adherence to authority? Or is it just really weird? Regardless, INSIDE is an incredible journey with increasingly bizarre encounters that mix action with clever puzzle designs. The game isn‚Äôt meant to be entirely understood. It‚Äôs meant to be experienced.  I started playing this game a while back, and it‚Äôs been a very interesting experience. This is about as indie as a game can get, which means dark themes, creepy stories, mostly grey backgrounds with red accents and ominous music. Overall, I would say that this is a fun, challenging puzzle game with great atmosphere, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes indie games.But there‚Äôs a catch. The controls are absolutely infuriating at times, completely ruining the experience. I went on a half-year long hiatus from this game, because the controls were so terrible, and they were preventing me from solving a seemingly simple puzzle. When your character is just walking around, they‚Äôre fine, but when he needs to run, that‚Äôs when the flaws really start to show. It is sometimes physically impossible to make him run fast enough without taking your finger off the screen and stopping entirely, which usually results in him getting caught, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the water levels. This is a fantastic game, but don‚Äôt buy it on the App Store. Get it on Steam, or wherever else they sell it where you don‚Äôt need to use a touch screen to move. Yes, it is a lot more expensive on those platforms, but the reason all of these computer/console games are so cheap on mobile is because it makes for an overall worse experience with these ultimately inferior control systems. So yes, you should get this game. Just don‚Äôt do it here. I‚Äôm in my forties and have been gaming since gaming began. I‚Äôm not a fan of platformers for the most part but this game is like nothing I‚Äôve ever played before.Visually, it‚Äôs a spectacle to behold. Amazing environments and animations. The attention to detail is among the highest I‚Äôve ever seen. The deaths are truly disturbing and gut wrenching (like the sound of your body hitting the ground after a long fall). You‚Äôll want to avoid death just because of the brutality of it. Yet, every way your character dies, you‚Äôll want to experience at least once since it‚Äôs so well done. The story is dark and crazy (almost like a Black Mirror episode) and the audio is perfect. Also, the controls, contrary to what some reviews say, are spot on and buttery smooth. This game is never leaving my phone since it‚Äôs with experiencing over and over. Kudos to the devs for such an amazing work of art.P.s. I‚Äôve noticed nearly all poor reviews are from idiots who have phones that aren‚Äôt compatible. Children, you can‚Äôt rate a game one star because your hardware can‚Äôt handle it! Use your brains! Other morons criticize the pay model, which is perfect! You download it for free and get to play the first chapter. If you like it, you can purchase the full premium game (which is a steal, by the way). If you don‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt have to spend a penny to figure it out. I wish all games were like this. "

I had to play on the developers time when they wanted me to; now I can play on my time when I feel like it.The game has a lot of the little issues from the original like the feeling that the true enemy of the game is its auto targeting system that I often wish there was a way to let me quickly override in game. Otherwise its got the same great twin stick action and short missions with challenging objectives.This version does have some features removed present in the IAP version such as multiplayer which I remember was a really enjoyable game mode for me. I can't really fathom why that with be removed in this version but it really is a bummer not to have it.Theres a lot of potential in future updates to add things like co-op, multiplayer, a rogue like Risk of Rain style game mode or a boss rush mode. Even custom community made missions would be a great way to add endless content and value to players. I'm glad the developers went this route with the monetization and I really enjoyed how much I've played so far and I am looking forward to finishing and 3 staring every mission, ideally with a friend in co-op, but even the single player is a lot of fun. Gameplay is great. Now that it‚Äôs not free to play the money system seems to be broken though. You end up with so much extra gold with nothing to spend it on. Also every star challenge involves the same handful of guns for some reason. The game is enjoyable for the first few hours, but gets repetitive later on. I was excited when I began playing - tons of weapons, gear, and abilities to unlock - but as I progressed, the game‚Äôs shortcomings began to present themselves. You‚Äôll unlock everything around level 40 and then you‚Äôll be trapped in a cycle of monotony for the latter half of the game. Upgrades don‚Äôt feel rewarding, levels are copied and pasted with only minor tweaks, and the shooting mechanics are lackluster. Your gun aims itself, stripping the player of any sense of agency. Also the in game currency is handed out like candy, rendering it almost useless because you never have to decide what to spend it on. Want that upgrade? Buy it. Want this upgrade? But it. There‚Äôs no need to manage your resources sense they flow like water. Again, let me say, I enjoyed this game for a few hours, but by the end it felt quite empty, unrewarding, and tedious. Three stars for a solid two hours of content and no in app purchases, but nothing ground breaking here. "

The story is also wholly worth it... it's a bit unconventional by most otome game standards, but rather unique and engaging. Honestly, I was a bit iffy on the art (sometimes the characters come off looking a bit derpy to me) at first but the storyline sealed the deal for me and after a while, the art didn't bother me as much as it did when I was playing the Lite version. However, this isn't your typical fluff so if you're looking for a lot of lovey-dovey type actions and such, you probably won't get much out of it.The length of this game is pretty average at seven chapters (plus the epilogues), given that the story continues with the other characters. I won't bother to go into the storyline, but I liked the approach to the story and the options you're given throughout. The options given were actually much more challenging for me than most other otome games so I really liked that aspect. If you choose the best answers you'll receive an epilogue after every chapter you achieve an ""S"" rank, which is vital if you're looking for the romance in all this! I am looking forward for the other character routes and to see how the plot progresses. :) Okay, I'll be honest; after I played through the game once, I set it down and forgot about it for three months.Today, I found it again in the very back of all my iPhone's pages of apps. I remembered how the game had appealed to me the first time, so I clicked it and started playing from the very beginning, the prologue.Oh boy. Sucked into the storyline immediately, I read and read until I was finished. I enjoyed the fairly hard choices to make each stage-- they were much harder than most otome game's choices. Akio was utterly adorable, and may I mention that his voice acting was perfect? His adult version was sexy and his child version was adorable. The voices were great.I will admit I was a bit taken back by the artwork sometimes. There were many occasions where the characters just looked plain weird. Still, the characters and plotline are well worth it. I found myself less bothered by the art by the fifth chapter than I could have imagined.Excellent story. Can't wait for the new ones. I was really disappointed with this visual novel. In my opinion, the story was somewhat flat and predictable, though it had its funny moments. For example, the carrot incident, which is immediately cut off by the game over. Speaking of which, the game gives you little to no freedom and forces you to take on the role of a character you know nothing about and guess what they're into. Sure, these choices are made fairly obvious by adhering to some humble hero standard, but doesn't that just make it less exciting?  And if you make the wrong choice, you are sent to the beginning of the stage (which makes sense since you are in a game, but is still annoying as crap). Also, the art was actually painful to look at. There were few instances where I saw any of the characters as attractive, and it was really only the princess.I had my doubts about this VN to begin with, but seeing all the praise it was receiving as well as  it being one of the few visual novels in the app store, I decided to buy it. After playing the VNs ""Scar of the Doll"" and ""Moe Cure Net"" for both a dollar each, I may have had high expectations from more expensive novels. ""Kira*Kira"" and ""Tears 9, 10"" were able to satisfy, but this just didn't seem well worth the price to me. Sorry.3/5 Would not recommend.(I tried to format this review for easy reading.) "

Instead of having to flip through countless books trying to find something specific, like a spell or racial feat from something less common, most of that is here and accessible within a few seconds. PSA: if you buy this, download discord and hop into their channel. You can speak directly to the developers and they‚Äôre very responsive. ALSO PSA: this app, while fantastic and easily the best out there in my opinion that I‚Äôve seen, is still in its youth. Be patient with the developers and let them update their content. All in all, I‚Äôm beyond happy with the Prism apps and look forward to using them to adventure away into the sunset for many years to come. Hi. I have downloaded this program onto two different devices. For the most part it works fine, but on my iPad you can‚Äôt scroll down on the ability cards. All the other cards work just fine though. On my iPhone, I was also having trouble with the ability cards. This time is wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt scroll down, it was that when I try to search for specific items, just just blocks out the search bar all together. It makes it so I can‚Äôt search. Those where my only problems with the app besides it not having all the creatures, but then again, who will? Over all, it‚Äôs a great app and is definitely worth getting if you are a dm. Hey Nathon! Thanks for the review! I think we talked a bit over email about this issue. So we are currently reworking cards/compendium functionality in the player app which we will soon (hopefully this week) be moving over to the dm app. We are getting rid of the problematic search bar and adding better formatted spell cards for viewing in landscape/portrait. Thanks again! I‚Äôve been on the look out for a decent DM tool to use during my games. I have found a few apps that are ok at a few things. But none of which have had a solid foundation for the future. The PrismScrollDM app has that solid foundation to build upon. The UI is clean and useful. The performance is outstanding, and further more the developer/developers are responsive and always willing to answer your questions. If I could wish for anything, it would be that PrismScrollDM would take some ideas of out the app Encounter+I feel like the Prism team could make a much better, more refined version of that app. They certainly have the fan base. Hello Joshua and thank you for the review! The faith that you have in our products to grow reinforces our own belief for what we want to see PrismScroll become. I had actually talked with the developer(s) of Encounter+ a bit about there tv functionality. I think their product is awesome and has some pretty great functionality. I definitely think you are right in that there are things we could learn and apply to the PrismScroll way of doing things. Stay tuned! "

PRESS: ----- Allaboutsymbian.com review: ""A good adventure game which can be recommended to anyone interested in the genre. There's no simple-minded action here, the puzzles do demand that you think about them so you can solve them. But if you're into adventure games then that's exactly what you want to hear.""  ----- Softonic.com review: ""On the whole, it is a captivating game that perfectly recreates the old graphical adventure genre to help transport you back to the 80s."" ----- Handango.com ""CrazySoft team strikes back with this excellent game that offers an intriguing adventure, intelligent gameplay, clever puzzles and good lasting appeal. Highly recommended!"" USER INTERFACE:  The point and click interface is as easy as that: You point and click somewhere on the game and you have two options: 'Examine' (Click the eye) or 'Operate' (Click the hand). 'Examine' looks at the spot you clicked and 'Operate' tries to do something with this spot. Sometimes there are multiple choices that you can do or say. E.g.: 'Take the bottle' and 'Leave the bottle there'.In this case you will see this choice box before the text.Just click the choice you wish once to select it and once more to activate it. Its as simple as that!  The game is really open. You can go almost wherever you want. If you want to get out of a place and visit another one just click on this icon. It means that there is an exit. The character icon shows where you are standing on the place. You can climb ladders, sit on chairs etc. You can 'Use Items from the inventory' to that icon as if you want to 'Operate' something on you. E.g.: If you have a trousers in the inventory and you want to wear it. You must click the trousers and then this icon.",https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple118/v4/f1/8a/83/f18a8366-aef2-79f6-737b-2822f040968c/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-2.png/1200x630wa.png,Text Adventure Game,5.0 ‚Ä¢ 2 Ratings,$3.99,,"October 10, 2018","The game is really, really good, for a .99$ game. There are simple, although sometimes pretty strange and out of place solutions, the dialogs made me chuckle and it took me three one hour bus trips to beat it - if you're bored, get it! Title says it all, after you spend (at most) 30min playing this game chances are you've beaten it which means it is impossible to replay since you know all of the answers. It's just like a point and click, except for this you've got to pay $1, though small in amount is it really worth half an hour? In my opinion j don't believe this game is worth it, I've played some pretty intense point and clicks and this game couldn't make my top 15. So save your money for a game you could play over and over again. "
‚ÄéDISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror,"DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is a 2D psychological horror adventure game. DISTRAINT was originally developed for PC and released on Steam 2015. In DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror you step into the shoes of an ambitious young man named Price. In order to forge a partnership from a famous company, Price seizes a property of an elderly woman. In that very moment he finds out the price of his humanity. This is his story and the tale of his regrets... __________________________________ FEATURES DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is a horror story. It is dark and grim but also has its share of dark humor.  The story progresses quickly which allows for several settings and scenarios. Your journey will last around two hours!  The gameplay is simple but effective: You move left and right and solve puzzles to progress through the story.  * Side scrolling 2D with unique, hand drawn graphics  * Atmospheric music and sound design  * Minimalist interface so your focus never wavers from the experience  * Delve into a unique story full of intriguing twists * Refined controls - Super easy to play on mobile devices __________________________________ SO MANY GAMES OUT THERE, WHY SHOULD I PLAY DISTRAINT? Right, so you're thinking if you would enjoy this little horror story? What makes DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror different than other horror games out there? That's a good question, I'd love to tell you more about the game and its atmosphere! This is not your typical modern horror game, jump scares and loud noises? Nope! Other horror games might rely solely on those but not DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror. DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is a psychological horror game which means the horror comes from its oppressing atmosphere and story. DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is pretty subtle on its horror, it's suitable for both hardcore horror fans and people that haven't played too many horror games in the past. There are quite a few DISTRAINT (PC) reviews out there, check them out if you're still unsure whatever to buy this game. __________________________________ DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE IOS AND PC VERSIONS In order to make the iOS port as playable as possible I needed to make some small changes to the game. In PC version you have a lantern, but porting this over to iOS brought too many problems. I decided to leave the lantern out from the iOS version and instead expand the environmental lighting. While doing so I also added more color which makes the iOS port more pretty to look at. To have as smooth experience as possible I capped the iOS version to 30 frames per second. However, DISTRAINT has a very little motion so this is barely even noticeable.",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/3a/00/91/3a009172-109d-7785-135d-9b7cf131e36d/pr_source.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.2 ‚Ä¢ 37 Ratings,$0.99,,"April 19, 2017","I enjoyed this game for a number of reasons: original and logical puzzles,  interesting and believable storyline, a couple good puns, and a layer of creepiness over everything that happens. It took me 4-5 hours to play through and I had to look up two solutions online, but I loved the overall feel and experience. I disagree with the reviewer that said this game was a claim about ""capitalism"" and ""eminent domain"" and whatever; the game has a message but it's more about how your mental state reacts when you live your life in conflict with your personal moral values. I definitely recommend giving this game a shot! This has some horror elements, but overall I would say it is far more haunting. After awhile the story starts to drag down your soul. The music is fantastic, the characters were well done, and the puzzles were the right amount of tricky (for me - but I'm kinda lazy, I'm just in it for the story). There were slight grammar errors once you got further into the game, but the spelling was fine, as you said. If you want someone to touch up your sentences really quick so it's easier for people to stay in character, let me know. I won't charge, this was a lovely game and I'm willing to help. I'm am up to the 'flash lantern/color change thing' that blocks certain doorways with Mushrooms, and I admit I'm frustrated. But I love the soundtrack, the strange mix of horror and creepy atmosphere, but also mystery and drama, with a decent storyline.   I'm not sure of the original language but this translation to English seems good, there are no distracting grammar issues.  Looking forward to finishing it if I have the patience to get through this part. Great price, and love the retro graphics. Not TOO pixelated like many games do now.ThanksUpdate:Aaaaand ... wow that was bleak and sad.   But, it was very unique: not totally horror, because it's based on a regular humdrum human life. I thought the blend of normality and creepy surreal feelings was done really well. But, yes, it's depressing, but obviously that's the point. I thought the use of colors to switch things were interesting but got really annoying in the hotel. Definitely different! Thanks "

We should be allowed to repeat a event i worked so hard for the first event horse and once I got it I was going for the next one but sense I didn‚Äôt have the time to do it I couldn‚Äôt get the horse that will be very helpful to be able to repeat events.For those of you that are wondering how to chat you HAVE to be 13+ when you join in the game then select your 13 or older to chat  it‚Äôs possibly better so we don‚Äôt have very young children chatting with people who are possibly WAYYYY over there age (like around 22 yr olds) and we shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with young kids chatting we don‚Äôt know what there thinking when there talking IF you signed up as below 13 yrs of age and are now 13 you may need to contact the developers to change it I love this game. It is easy to understand and it is for free. But what I don‚Äôt like about is all of the glitching. The game will start a race In the middle of a course and eat you coins as soon as you touch the next jump. Or it will bring you home and not have your bat filled like it did before. Please fix this, then I will give you a better rating. Thank you for your time to make this game, just fix a few things! Thank you! Second off, how do you talk to other horses? I read someone‚Äôs review and it says that they can talk to other horses in the game. I don‚Äôt understand why some of the quests are so hard at level 19. Own 5 horses when it says you only have 2 and I know I have 5 horses 6 actually sometimes this game is confusing and I don‚Äôt understand some of the things it tells you to do when you HAVE done it.  I would also like to know which level you can talk to other horses. I would like to know this because I HATE ITWHEN OTHER HORSES FOLLOW YOU AROUND- EVERYWHERE YOU GO!  ü§¨ ü§¨ü§¨ !!!! It is super annoying and I just want to tell them please stop following me around.

And I have a lot of games. For starters it‚Äôs really easy to get free mode. And I love free mode because you could do what ever you want on it. And the levels are also really fun to. Mostly because you have a specific objective and you get to look around this whole entire city and bump into things and knock things over and look for what you need. Overall Dino simulator is by far one of most fun games out there and you will be missing out if you don‚Äôt get it. The game is fun when you‚Äôre not being interrupted by a stupid ad right IN THE MIDDLE OF GAME PLAY! I can understand having ads AFTER a round. That would make sense, but WHILE you‚Äôre playing the game? That‚Äôs just stupid and annoying! Plus, there are too many! The interruptions mess you up and the game starts playing again before the ad close button pops up, so you lose valuable time and/or you continue to take damage from the enemy. The dinosaur is a little hard to maneuver but I can deal with that. It‚Äôs just an added challenge. However, it would be nice to be able to choose what side you want the controller on, especially if you‚Äôre right handed.Oh, and at one point, when you first start playing the game, it tries to extort a 5 star review out of you before it will let you play one of the modes. Come on... you want a five star review? Come by it honestly and fix the above issues. That‚Äôs when I‚Äôll give it a 5 star review. In the meantime, I don‚Äôt think it will be worth it to keep on my phone because the interruptions from the ads ruin the fun. It‚Äôs too bad because I was really enjoying the game. üòï I love this game so much,but the ads dont stop i just saw an ad about kick yhe buddy,but then the same kick the buddy ad comes up a few seconds later,ITS ANNOYING and i cant remove the ads so can you atleast have the option to skip?other than that i love this game and i have to rate five stars to get free mode and the t rex is not a t rex!!!!its a creatasaurs(sorry if I spelled that wrong)and can u have the option to eat the steak to heal and this game is really cheap and THE ADS MAKE ME DIE "

I greatly enjoyed the mechanic of having control of two characters and potentially having two different personalities between the two. Plus I feel this game gives me an experience that isn‚Äôt all that touched on too well. The ability to be the villain! I‚Äôve played the academy for upcoming super villains and I enjoyed it my first time through. But ultimately it felt lacking in motivation. I entered the school because my mother was a villain? Here my character suffered a traumatic experience that caused serious mental and physical injuries. Also your choice of what villain you will be is a fine touch as well. And with how the ending appeared for me, I‚Äôm looking forward to a potential sequel. I can‚Äôt remember a time I read a story this quickly. It‚Äôs such an interesting world they‚Äôve created and the characters are all so interesting. In the beginning it felt a little more like you could steer the story yourself but as things progressed I felt more like the character‚Äôs bitterness kind of overwhelmed your ability to choose. So my choices looked out of place with the story. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the answers I chose earlier on, I don‚Äôt know, but playing a full on villain while not getting the full picture about what happened to make your character want to destroy their former friends/allies broke some of my immersion. If I‚Äôm gonna be that vengeful to some seemingly decent folks, I kind of want more of a complete picture. Maybe I‚Äôd have learned more about the incident from their past with different choices. Also RO wise, for a player choosing to date guys but not wanting to have a romantic relationship with Ortega, the interactions got a little frustrating.  Kind of felt like he was the only real option and he was constantly thrown at you. Regardless of the things I didn‚Äôt love, I really adore Fallen Hero and will replay it. Also excited for the next book!! The good: You‚Äôre playing a character who is struggling emotionally.  I would say that she had a mild personality disorder (inability to trust other people) which was exacerbated by PTSD.  Your choices and the writing manage to force you to stay within the constraints of your mental illness, while still allowing you some leeway about how to react in particular situations.  Because of the skillful writing, you can feel some of her emotions, like you would in a good novel.  More generally, the author really does know how to write well.  Setting the scene and dialogue/banter are novel-quality, which is not the case in many CoG/Hosted Games.The bad: A lot of information crucial to your character is revealed piecemeal throughout the story.  I think some of it still hasn‚Äôt been revealed.  This includes her history (events that made her the way she is), her goals, and the practical plans to accomplish them.  Since your character would know all of these things, it left me feeling unable to fully absorb myself in her.  I could feel her emotions like she was a whole person, but when I tried to think like her, she was a cardboard cutout. "

But all the iOS Microid games I've played have been seriously truncated. This is no exception. Entire puzzles are missing, or have simply become a cut-out scene. The resulting game play feels far too easy. It probably won't disappoint if you didn't play it on PC, but if you did, prepare to feel short-changed. That said, and despite it being too short, it's still an okay adventure game. And I'd much rather these classic games were adapted than not, so three stars here. Please, do the very first Atlantis next, and don't skip anything! So apparently this version of the game skips about 95% of the content from the PC version. Missed dialogues, interactions and more. The game makes no sense to me and this is the only version I have played (googled a guide from gameboomers to see if I missed some stuff. Turns out I missed the whole story :/) Unlike a previous reviewer I like the graphics, though not the Near-East type world they create at the beginning of the game. Fortunately that world is left behind soon. Judging this game by comparing it to most games out there, I'm giving it five stars.  I love this type of straightforward, gimmickless  adventure game, and the occasional humor was nice.  But I got spoiled by some of the other Microids games out there, such as the two Dracula games and Amerzone, and this one seemed a bit more choppy and less consistent, probably because it contained more worlds.  I may also have a bias toward dark, Dracula-type themes. But I'll gladly replay this game before I play another silly hidden objects game.SPOILERSIf you're still wandering in the hills, look for a cave. If you have no stick to make a fire, it's because you haven't found the right stick yet. If the two sages don't answer your questions, it's because you haven't approached them in the right order.

It is not the most original concept but it is handled well and there are quite a few elements that turn now mundane story tropes into something refreshing and almost new. Most importantly it was a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed reading through every line and page and I especially appreciated the length, allowing you to get drawn into the story and characters without feeling like it drags on. There are some errors in coding but nothing that won‚Äôt get sorted out within a few days. And perhaps even more so this was the first time since probably choice of robots that I did not feel like I had to restart on the first playthrough. The game is very good about working within your choices as long as you present consistency of character. It will still punish you on mistakes but even those are done so well that you feel like it‚Äôs just indeed another branch or path as opposed to a mistake. I loved the main character and playing as her and felt like my play style very well reflected in the writing. I don‚Äôt review things, but in my fever induced mania perhaps I‚Äôm turning over a new leaf. I‚Äôve played lots of excellent Choice Of games, my favorites being the Heroes series, so you can probably see a trend here. But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever been as drawn into a world like I have with Superlatives. Weather Control is one of my favorite powers so that helps, and I genuinely enjoy leading a team where other games have only given you the facade of doing so, that I‚Äôve played anyway. I like the characters, I‚Äôm genuinely interested to see what each one thinks and says, who they are as people and heroes. Now I‚Äôm not that far in, maybe chapter 5 or so, but everything is so consistent thus far that I‚Äôd be surprised if it took a nose dive. I‚Äôll certainly review again once I‚Äôve finished but I look forward to playing the rest with great aplomb. This game was awesome. I wish I could have gotten a little deeper into my romance with Hugh, but otherwise I have no complaints. I used to read choose your own adventure books as a kid. This is the first adult kind of version of that which I‚Äôve really enjoyed. :) "

The only issue is how do I drop back down from a ledge? Other than that, thank you for bringing this back into my life... I guess, who‚Äôll I‚Äôm asking questions, how can I legit buy this game and not have to watch ads or get diamonds or anything? Also, most reviews here are from kids that cant be pleased. Please ignore them and their issues. I appreciate the classic game was brought to IOS, but the game has many problems. First is the graphical quality. The graphics look like they were rushed. It looks like they just typed in some stuff and left it like that. Second, I know this is a mobile game, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that we need gems to move on in the game. They could have something like credits, since it is an arcade game. Next would have to be the controls. They‚Äôre to hard to use, and seems like they‚Äôre in the wrong places. It‚Äôd be better to use a joystick like control on the left so that you can move and jump instead of pressing seperate buttons to do it. And the bubble button should be bigger too. Last would have to be the fact that the promotional things for this game tease multiplayer, something that isn‚Äôt actually shown in the game. Although it is hard to add multiplayer to a mobile game, there are ways it can be added gracefully. I feel like, the bad ending when you only play single player should have been added, because the whole original game was about teamwork. Other than that, the game plays mostly the same from the original.

The coco thing is not what I expected it to be I wait 7 hours for those to come and the option to get them should be when u have 0+ and the holding space of coco should be more than 5 coco so please make the storage of coco bigger and better. I thought u could talk to the tiny child nope u don't and we should be able to customize the child's eyes and clothes, please put that in and work on the game customization and other things but the bugs being fixed bruh it's fine no bugs!! I was searching my App Store and found this game it looked adorable and said you could interact with the little boy I thought this would be the best game ever the best I've ever played but no it's not this isn't even a game all you do is wait 50 minutes for chocolate bars? and tap around the screen with flowers or other stuff like that it's honestly really boring and I just would like if you could interact with the boy it's an adorable concept a great style to it but it says you can interact with the boy and you just can't this literally would be the best game ever if you can just interact with him fully like there's a little bubble above his head that says he's hungry/sleepy/ect. Or just be able to play games with the boy or be able to talk into the phone and he answers back through something like that it's adorable I will admit that but the layout is just flat out boring. And can I even named him? I can't choose what clothes to put on him or what color hair eyes he should have or even our storyline I can't do anything but tap the screen feed him chocolate what kind of pastime is this it's horrible just some mini games or. Any games you could possibly play with the boy or choose the clothes or stuff like that there's just no interaction is says in the description that you can but obviously you can't. I'm thinking about deleting the game so fix it up quick before nobody wants to get it anymore try your best -Safire PLZ!!!! Well it‚Äôs good and cute but.. u have to use REAL LIFE MONEY to GET DIAPERS? Just whyyyy. And for some reason the Watch button, which is for getting chocolate bars for the baby demon, it won‚Äôt work for me, I keep pressing it but it won‚Äôt show me an ad to get some chocolate, and we have to wait for like, idk but 53 minutes!? Why can‚Äôt it be ten minutes? Also the baby demon is cute but it‚Äôs so small, it‚Äôs the size of a toy tbh, but for me I feel like it takes a while to make the baby demon grow up, and I also have some ideas for the game! One, we should be able to name the baby, bc we don‚Äôt what to call it but a baby demon. And we should decorate the house, it‚Äôs so plain, just saying tho. And can we get coins to just buy diapers with the coins? Anyway the game is good but there are a lot of problems and good ideas that should be added to the game, the game is kinda like idle games, and their is nothing else to do basically, just accept my ideas, and I hope some of the updates will add some ideas Like naming the baby, and I‚Äôm sorry that this is so long, their are so many problems and I hate it, also my mom is kinda poor right now, so there should be a sale to get the diapers, like one penny, but I guess u won‚Äôt cuz u guys want to suffer, if u do that, now I‚Äôm going, bye bye! üòí "

I too often cannot see the obvious staring me straight in the eye, and thus over complicate the search.  I love having hints that nudge you along in the journey without revealing the answer.  This games‚Äô hint system, which required you to watch a video that I would not have minded doing so, simply would not function.  To move forward in this game I found myself referring to a few walkthroughs.  And I am glad I did, because the game is fun, wonderfully drawn, comical and had lots of hidden Easter eggs to reward a players effort.  4 stars because the hint system would not function; otherwise 5.  I enjoyed this a lot. Loved the graphics, story, and unique puzzles. The only suggestion would be to make it more obvious to move on to the next level. I would‚Äôve never known to start over with a new game to finish playing if I wouldn‚Äôt have looked online for help. Why not just make it part of the journey? I‚Äôm afraid some people would totally miss out on all the extra fun tidbits. I liked how it shows your achievements so you know if you‚Äôve completed all the puzzles. I will be playing part2!

Eipix is known for innovative, engaging, high quality adventures that give the gamer their money's worth. Unfortunately this was not the case this time, for as this mystery lacked the pizazz, suspense and intrigue that one usually associates with any game developed by this brilliant company. Annoying for this reviewer that at various times throughout play of game, one would encounter lack of sound accompaniment to written screen character verbalizations, in addition to not always being able to use map when so desired (Map would suddenly disappear from screen for some unknown reason, only to later reappear for usage). Finally, play time not as long as usual expected from Eipix productions.Thank you for your continued support & following. Happy New Year!~Kamen Rider The HOS and the mini games were so different than most others...and fun.  Worth the $, decent playing time. My only complaint is, and it's not really a complaint, is once you found the globes...they didn't Do anything. Didn't add to the story, didn't give extra background to the story or characters no reward to finding them all. Don't quite get the point but nothing worth losing a star over. Good game! "

Beautiful graphics and sound (although I prefer the TurboGrafx-16 music over any other version, sad that it was not available as a music option) and lots of fun to play again.If I could change one thing, it would be to add a FIXED gamepad on the screen.  They do have the option for a ""fixed pad"" but it can be anywhere on the screen.  Too much freedom in that has led me to trouble many times, and I know I'm not the only one who had this comment.Otherwise, brilliant game and I hope they bring some of the other Ys games to iOS!  Well done.  üòä Love all things Ys, except this (chronicles) port‚Äîwhich I now despise. On a platform with d-pads and buttons chronicles is epic, the mobile ports however (what with having to drag your finger around and/or mash spots in the corners) is unplayable garbage for anyone with hands larger than an eight year old thanks to how easy it is for said actions to obscure ones field of view‚Äîwhich typically results in repeated death during boss fights (to the point of rage).My review: this/these port(s) should be buried in the desert next to NES ET.

The story is intriguing, the music is pleasant and changes along with the story, the graphics are nice and the pictures at the end of each chapter and beautiful.

I look forward to a continuation of the story and will be sure to buy. This app provides a pleasant and creative approach to a zen tangram with pretty art ‚Äî a solid 3 1/2 star effort (rounded up to four stars because of its creativity).  However, it really needs better translation into English because the present poor quality is jarring and distracting.  This is an experienced developer and I can‚Äôt understand why it would be so lacking in this respect.  Oh, there is one other improvement that would very much improve the gameplay ‚Äî as another reviewer pointed out, the contrast/opacity of the puzzles is too faint so why not make this user-adjustable??

However, this game has solid gameplay but a poor story. You will tire of the dialogue quickly, especially when Leo says, ""Leo's the name, RPG's my game."" In a way you can try to see how campy the dialogue is, in a sort of so bad it's good way. Darkgate just has you tap on tiers to change to stronger jobs and manually set individual abilities, so it is a bit confusing at first (with no tutorial). Fortunately it becomes simple to use once you get used to activating passive abilities and skills. You can also speed up battles and you basically break up auto battle with commands/abilities rather than input turns, so the fighting is nice. Fortunately, the game is an improvement on Grinsia because it has better menus and you can quickly enter/exit towns and dungeons. I do like how Darkgate lets you change the difficulty at any time in case there are spikes or you need a level 1 character to level up quickly. In short, play it while it is on sale if you need to laugh at something or are in an rpg drought. Another Hit-Point game that I just absolutely LOVE. It's probably the most complex of the Kemco RPGs, mainly because of the job system. You'll have to constantly change jobs depending on where you're going and what type of enemies you'll be facing, and it can be quite daunting at first. But once you get into it, it really shines. "

Create. Conquer.,4.6 ‚Ä¢ 95.4K Ratings,Free,#60 in Adventure,"September 1, 2020","I am so glad this game popped up in ads online a few weeks ago. I have always been a huge fan of the computer and Xbox Elder Scrolls series. I thought since it was mobile that it may be a disappointment, BUT I absolutely love it. Amazing graphics for mobile, a nice storyline, it‚Äôs just like the other versions. I just defeated the Lich king or whatever and saved my city. I hope something new comes up in the storyline soon as now I only have small side mission quests to do from the board, which is completely repetitive. Perhaps when I fill up more empty slots in my city, more quests will pop up. We will see. People who complain about this being a p2p game are very impatient and/or unknowledgable. I am level 36 and for the most part getting there was f2p and without difficulty. I got some revival scrolls in the beginning levels, but that was with gems given to me in the game for free. Eventually I thought I might need a lot of gems or something later on and bought a cheat at a great deal with gems and revival scrolls that was 100 usd for only 20 usd. And guess what? I still haven‚Äôt even used those gems yet because it has so far been unnecessary. And only a handful of those scrolls which also one don‚Äôt really need although convenient. This is practically pretty much a f2p game. Those who complain it isn‚Äôt are probably (hopefully) kids who are impatient or don‚Äôt study all the parts to the game to see how to accomplish without paying. I've played this for awhile now. I also read all the reviews where people are saying is boring or hard around level 9. Here's the deal, this game is awesome if played correctly I'm currently level 24, with my town about level 7 ( just a bit under ), I don't know if people are not building their towns up, but that actually expands the game, brings in new missions, upgrading shops gives better options to craft or buy with in game currency. Early on when things are easy upgrade your inventory slots and chest capacity with the free premium gems they give you ( I get a lot free fighting in the dungeons) I have over 700 now, never bought anything. Time your chest timers around your work day, open gold while you sleep, never run into waiting issues. As far as combat and  complaining about dying, here's a tip get the healing dodge and upgrade it, choose your talents and perks wisely, craft health absorbing armor and jewelry, with the right loadout, and proper potion planning, no quest is too difficult, the challenging ones are harder because they're supposed to be, you'll have a wonderful feeling of accomplishment when they drop a free legendary chest on you.I'm level 24, all eleven gear, rings and necklace, usually have 15-20 various chests to cycle through, over 700 premium gems saved up from free drops, haven't spent a dime of real life currency.Play smart play often, this is an unbelievable free offering from the elder scrolls franchise!!!! I played for a month before writing this review because I understand it is still a beta release, Blades, in my opinion is by far the best game on a cellphone and trust me that I should be a critic I have played and deleted thousands of games. With all that being said Blades has amazing graphics that I would expect on a console, the gameplay is amazingly polished especially because you can tell they are improving it daily, when I first started Blades would shut down or freeze every so often (once a day) and now I cannot remember the last time that has happened. The pace of the game seems perfect to me as some days I don‚Äôt have as much time I will open the treasure chests and construct new buildings in my city and on the days I want to grind for gold, material or weapons etc etc... Blades surely lets me decide my own pace. I believe Bethesda is by far the best game developing company ever to make games so this is not a impartial  review, I already knew I would love this game as I have from everything they have ever released. So far the only thing I would like added to Blades is the ability to change between first person and third person as so many of Bethesda games have done in the past, it is amazing that this game is free because I dropped many other games off of my phone, Blades is all I need. Thank you Bethesda and also a thanks goes out to whoever read this book I just wrote. "

I thought it would be more challenging & engaging like the other IOS games so I didn‚Äôt hesitate to buy it. I noticed it says ages 4 & up, well now I know why, it definitely feels more like a kids game to me. I wish I had waited before purchasing this one to make sure it was like the games I love to play, Botanica is still my favorite, I love how you can interact with every object whereas in this game you kinda poke & have 2 or 3 choices, & that feel like a challenge to me I guess. üòî I am usually not a mean person towards reviews, but I just HAVE to point this out.When I first got this game, I had high hopes. But seeing every little speck and corner of this game made my brain automatically Think: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing something completely wrong. Am I?‚Äù But it was too late. My finger had already pressed the download button. And I just KNEW I was about to go on a terrible ride. No character in this game I cared about. They all felt like a wasted level idea. Music just sounds like some random sounds all mashed together to fit the  situation. Story is probably the worst of this review. A little orange monster named Chuchel trying to get a cherry that is always out of his reach? That sounds as simple as Mario trying to rescue Princess Peach! Sorry for all my negativity, but of all the games Animata Design has made, PLEASE skip this one! PLEASE!!!!!!! I was expecting a more challenging and compelling game, I really enjoyed all the other Amanita design games, the only games I have purchased from the store and World of Goo. I liked Chuchel but more for kids, it is a funny game, some scenes are really hilarious, but It took me 15 days to finish, and not because it was hard, it was because I didn‚Äôt even remember it was there. Not like Samorost, Machinarium or Botanicula, for those I couldn‚Äôt stop until the end. And the music was not that good either. The characters are cute for what I said, kids. I was disappointed when I realized that it was just that, a funny game. If you have children under 7 they will love this game.

‚ÄéPink Princess House Craft Game,"Once upon a time, a little princess decided to build a lovely pink mansion. She wanted it to look like a doll house because she adores toys and dolls. But the point is that most of these toys and dolls, she seized from children! This naughty princess also took all your toys which you now need to find and retrieve.  Depending on which character you choose to play, you will have a different set of toys to find in the Pink Princess House. If you select to play as a boy, you will then have to search for cars. And if you take on a girl‚Äôs role, you will have to find a pony and all dolls (rest assured there are really many of them to keep you busy and entertained)!  Get ready to play through an amazing doll house explore adventure! But bear in mind ‚Äì the capricious pink princess and her friends are not willing to give their toys and dolls just for a thank you!  To outwit the girls, you will have to move around the pink mansion very quickly, and there are a lot of secret places to hide. The pink princess hates to play hide-and-seek ‚Äì make her angry by hiding properly, say, under a bed, a table or in a wardrobe!  The Pink Princess House is awesomely huge, which makes it a perfect place to play hide-and-seek. This mansion features several floors, a large garden with a beautiful fountain, multiple rooms with posh furniture, and delicious pink blocks walls ‚Äì a true embodiment of a pink princess dream!  Explore every corner in the princess doll house because your toys can be anywhere! Make sure you visit a store, too. There you will buy all necessary stuff to play tricks on the pink princess and her friends. In the store, you can find a plethora of useful things including a cute puppy that can bring a pony or a car to you, a potion of invisibility, the princess‚Äôs pet cat, and lots of other valuable and interesting items.  Once you have discovered your every toy and doll, your next objective will be to find the button, opening the exit door, and escape from the pink house. We highly recommend using the mansion‚Äôs map to easily navigate in this location.  On first sight, you may think it is a game for girls, but it is absolutely not! You can opt to play this game in the boy mode and search for cars, play hide-and-seek with girls, drink a speed potion, and run around the pink blocks estate like a lightning! When you get to a terrace, you will see for yourself that this mansion is a perfect doll house!  It is essentially a craft game, in the world of which, everything is block-shaped, and there are no round forms! If you are a fan of craft games, then you definitely should try the Pink Princess House game, which is made of hundreds of pink blocks!  Before you try to escape from the pink princess dream house, make sure you have explored every spot here because if you fail to find all missing toys, the exit button will not get activated. The house map will help you understand which room you have not visited yet. A pony, dolls, and cars are very small so that you should be very attentive while exploring the rooms. If you have difficulties finding the toys, just call up the puppy ‚Äì he is always ready to help you.  Pink princess house is a game for girls and boys alike!

Besides that, this game offers an excellent range of game play at a very steady pace. It gives you reachable goals, a free boost up to lvl 1000, provides fun and difficult challenges, and I have paid $0 in total. You don‚Äôt NEED to buy the ‚ÄòStarter Pack‚Äô to progress. You just need to play. I‚Äôve been playing for a few weeks, logging on for my daily gems that the devs GIVE you, leveling things up, and repeating. It‚Äôs not mindless, because it still gives you daily quests to complete. It is a fun, easy game to pick up that you definitely do NOT have to pay to advance. However, I‚Äôm not saying you SHOULDN‚ÄôT pay, if you want to help out the devs with all of their hard work, you definitely CAN pay.All in all, great game, I‚Äôm on level 2500 and steadily rising every day. Wish I had more bottles, but it‚Äôs a minor hiccup in an all-around great game! I‚Äôve spent a few days playing this and I have to say I‚Äôm quite surprised. One of the better incremental games out there. I‚Äôd go so far as to say it has the potential of something like Tap Titans 2 if it‚Äôs done right. ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù currency is easy to get, yes there are ads but what game doesn‚Äôt have them. This one doesn‚Äôt really throw them in your face tho. And you don‚Äôt really miss out on much if you don‚Äôt watch them all. I‚Äôd personally like to see something of a guild/clan setup at some point, it‚Äôs one of the features I‚Äôd say is missing. Otherwise, and excellent idle or semi-idle game to play in my book. I‚Äôve played this game for a little over a week now, and I can safely review this game. It‚Äôs fun, has all the idle elements that you‚Äôd like to see. Upgrade system, different currencies, raids. But it‚Äôs greediness gets in it‚Äôs own way. What do I mean? Well do you want a new weapon? On that‚Äôs preferable Unique or Legendary? Well there‚Äôs only ONE way to acquire this. Either a single roll with 500 gems, (which is paid currency, and a fair amount of it. Roughly $5) that has a 7% of receiving decent items. Don‚Äôt want to roll? Well there‚Äôs another way to get the weapons! Buy them! For $10-$99!! That‚Äôs nonsense. I can‚Äôt play the game at a certain point because the upgrades that help progress to the next level, all require $. That‚Äôs just one atrocity among many in this game. Truthfully, I have no idea why this game has more than 3 stars. This is truly a mediocre game, with a shameful cash grab system. All in all, I say **** this developer. Make a game playable before adding the most shameless cash grab I‚Äôve seen. Shame shame. "

And then the app updates this afternoon to be ‚Äúproperly outfitted for the latest iPhone models‚Äù. Talk about timing. Guess I‚Äôll have to play through it once more!Was a lot of fun.

I may even end up ordering a book for my wife‚Äôs kindergarten class. Burly Men at Sea is a cut above most of the cobbled-together apps and games you will find in the App Store. It's full of delightful surprises, secret opportunities, careful details and gorgeous art work. If you're wanting to be immersed in ancient Nordic mythology with as a burly, bearded sailor, this is the adventure for you.

Judging by the previous version's low scores this must have been greatly improved for v2.I played it on an iPad; it would not go well on a smaller screen. I didn't have any issues with the game.

Genshin Impact has shown me that I waited long enough, the game asked me to write a review but I just couldn‚Äôt stop playing at the time. I have a few suggestions but the game doesn‚Äôt need major changes the updates are spontaneous but that is to come of a new game so it‚Äôs not a complaint, if you‚Äôre looking for a game that you can like and that has beautiful graphics along with fighting mechanics then this is your game. With the dungeons and monsters and many different places to visit it‚Äôs even fun just running around looking at the world, although one suggestion I have is that instead of just food to heal your party members why not add craftable health potions and such so my character doesn‚Äôt feel sick when eating so much üòÇ. The purity and smooth play of the game is phenomenal though, I‚Äôve already suggested it to a dozen people and I think this game has greater potential, on the other hand I was opening this was a open world multiplayer aswell, but the story says otherwise. If you need to relax and relieve stress this is the game, but if you want to play with friends and find people to meet you better have them added or you‚Äôll be alone like I am! All in all having a better friends system would be awesome but the game itself is phenomenal! Paimon is so Kawaii!!!!! So. The only problem I have with this game is the overwhelming lag that this game brings to the phone. If you guys could really fix this, I‚Äôd be very happy, cause I was Interested to see all of the amazing animations that you guys could bring to such a magnificent game as this one. Plus, it should be brought to my attention that you should get the material for wishes easier. I have been trying my hardest, but I always seem to get nothing, although I just do quests and stuff that don‚Äôt have them. (I understand that this is a very early version of the game, and your improving it.) Also, VERY. good job on the character models for this game. Honestly, this is the first ever good RPG game, making the fact that all the others were not very good, since it limits you to a lobby, not experiencing the world, and just fighting. I would also like to add, something That would improve this game a lot is if you guys had different Customizations. Like Clothes, Wing Gliders (there are 3 available so, I guess I have a wrong point there) And much more! It would seem to me so fun if there was a whole variety to this game. Also, Amazing game on the characters. I really like all of them, and I favor this game a lot. As being one of your big fans, please take these ideas into suggestion and improve the game early on! I would love to see this game being one of the most played games in the world ! ! I hope the best of luck to you guys! People are calling this game ‚Äúanime Legend of Zelda,‚Äù which is pretty much true. It is so fantastic and honestly I‚Äôm so in love with it. The storyline, combat, graphics, everything is great! The fact that you can switch characters to fight certain elements is something that I really like, especially with the really amazing voice acting that comes with it. I haven‚Äôt been this invested in a game in a while and I‚Äôm ready to play it through and through. I haven‚Äôt found any glitches yet so far so that‚Äôs Great!     One thing I will say, though, is that I really am excited for this to come out on Xbox and the Nintendo Switch. I kind of hope it could come out on Mac but Mac has been kind of complicated recently and various games have been becoming incompatible with it due to new updates. I also would love it if mounts were a thing. Even if horses can‚Äôt be programmed into the game, at least a hoverboard or something that goes equally as fast as the running speed. This game, I understand, just got released so there‚Äôs still obviously more things to do, so I can‚Äôt wait to see what more there is to come! I love everything about this game, I forgot to say how glorious the music is, too, and I‚Äôm just honestly amazed. Anyways, weeb/geek rant over. I‚Äôm just too happy with this game.

Without a map, I'm lost! The rest is pretty typical. I keep thinking with each scene change I'll find a map, but no luck so far. Don't know how far I'll go with it. I've been a huge fan of BFG for a VERY long time now, but as of late, they are a totally different company, and one I really don't like. First, they don't give you the first chapter free anymore (if they had, I would have seen that I had already downloaded and paid for this game, but they re-advertised it and I thought it was a new game, and since the first chapter wasn't FREE, I was forced to buy it before finding out I've already played it). Second, game prices jumped from two dollars a game to seven dollars a game over night?!? Perhaps this company is going for all new customers and couldn't care less about the old ones, because, as an old customer, I'm getting fed up with these antics. So I play the game and then it gets stuck. I cannot do anything. So I say ok lets restart it and start again form the beginning. (After playing it for two in a half days)! Then I get farther and everytime the guy hands me the orb the whole game shuts down completely! Wth!!  Ugh!!! "

I find this game hard to play because of technical things. Some of these thing where probably never an issue on pc. Switching it to be an app must be a daunting task. I‚Äôm sure developers did their best, but some things are better with a mouse and keyboard. There are two glitches in this game. The first one is that when you put bottles in the recycling machine, the bottles will float on the screen (not in your inventory) for the rest of the game. The second glitch is that an error alert will pop up and exit you out of the game and you'll have to start the entire game over. The second glitch, however, is avoidable by purposely making the first glitch happen early on in the game. This is perfectly fine because you can always get coins from Mr. Baldini by bringing him produce. As a result, I loved this game as a kid and still do! And as long as you get that first glitch to happen early on in the game, you're golden. "
‚Äé60 Parsecs!,"Atomic Space Age was a blast! Until it became the Post-Apocalyptic Space Age. Your space station is about to explode and you only have 60 seconds before things get messy. What (or who) will you grab before you make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle and begin your journey into THE GREAT UNKNOWN? This is 60 Parsecs!, a dark comedy sci-fi adventure set in the Atomic Space Age - complete with all the Cold War paranoia, chrome-plated wall accents and cockroaches with space helmets. Lead a crew of woefully unprepared astronauts, equipped with whatever junk - sorry - ""supplies"" you can grab before blasting off, on a journey across the cosmos that's best described as misguided. Make the best of it, while dealing with soup shortages and other horrors of outer space. Will you have what it takes to find a new home and survive? Bon voyage! SCAVENGE & EVACUATE With only 60 seconds before nukes reduce the space station to floating particles in the vacuum of space, frantically grab whatever supplies and crew you can before getting out of there. You never know when that sock puppet will come in handy. SURVIVE & DECIDE Space funerals are inconvenient, so try to avoid dying where possible. Use your limited supplies and (hopefully not limited) wits to make difficult choices and ensure your survival, even though the odds are definitely stacked against you. EXPLORE & CRAFT Duct tape fixes all problems, but how do you fix (or at least craft) duct tape? Chart expeditions to find resources, craft survival essentials and explore strange new worlds in a procedural, very-much-permadeath adventure. LEAD & PROTECT As captain, it's your duty to keep the crew happy - they're less likely to kill you that way. Manage relationships as you watch them grow closer and hopefully not throw each other out the airlock.",https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/43/2e/9e/432e9ed3-884e-5187-3d95-6f593934ae14/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-9-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.5 ‚Ä¢ 58 Ratings,$3.99,#58 in Adventure,"September 4, 2020","I‚Äôve played both 60 Seconds & 60 Parsecs, and I‚Äôd have to say that 60 Parsecs is the superior title.1. The CharactersIn 60 Seconds, the family doesn‚Äôt have much personality. They have names and appearances, but nothing unique about them! In 60 Parsecs, each crew member as a special personality and different strengths and weaknesses, as well as more defining physical features. 2. The Story60 Seconds has you stay in a shelter due to a nuclear bomb to wait until you are rescued. 60 Parsecs has you launch into space inside a shuttle as Earth is bombed into destruction, and you must find somewhere to live. 60 Parsecs clearly wins in this category. 3. The Gameplay60 Parsecs updates the original formula with a crafting system, additional areas to travel, more characters and more! 60 Seconds main things to do are go on expeditions, make a choice, and ration. 60 Parsecs expands on the initial design and increases its quality.In conclusion, 60 Parsecs is a considerable step up from 60 Seconds (a game I enjoyed). I think this game is great and anyone who liked 60 Seconds with love 60 Parsecs. It‚Äôs really good as most of the other reviews have said but there‚Äôs is this one part I think is a bug. On the stormy planet, if the old alien alien guy comes to ask for power no matter what you say, yes or no it will always say you had to decline. I hope this gets fixed so I can get an ending at that point! Game was really good except that it didn‚Äôt record any progress in the Records Section, I built lots of stuff but the records were all Zeros‚Äôs and showed none of the progress I had made, I was able to save a video to my photo album but when I clicked to save my adventure to Facebook after finishing, the game crashed and when I loaded it to try again it wouldn‚Äôt let me because the game save was gone and would only let me start a new game.I hope you fix this because when you make progress in a game it should show up in the game.This game could use a patch or two to fix those issues.And maybe a way to store more than one game save.

I feel like most pr teams don‚Äôt read these. These guys either actually read the reviews or realized on their own that there was an issue, and fixed it fairly quickly so either way I‚Äôm a fan. Five stars.I love this game and have all three stars on all levels (minus the ones in Halloween Spooner Street, but including the completion of Grayson Morebees Camp Slashenchop ones) and all I have to say is that the glitches with each update are too frustrating for progress. I beat all of the Halloween event levels, but don‚Äôt know where to go to craft my items to obtain my rewards seeing as they have disappeared from Stewie‚Äôs backpack once the event started. To make it worst I am #1 on the event leader boards, so I‚Äôd like to reap what I‚Äôve sewn! You are able to craft them once you have gotten all three items and the pop up at the bottom of the screen shows what you have collected, however if you miss that second and a half window, there‚Äôs no where to go to claim your prize. I‚Äôm a loyal player and still come back to replay levels and complete quests while I wait for new levels to be added within the next update (contrary to popular opinion I understand this takes time). On top of all this, there are only ten days left in the event so please fix this before it is over! Please? Hi there, we are sorry that you have this issue. We would like to take an opportunity to address this issue. Please contact us so we can discuss this in greater detail.**From your game go to the Settings Menu and select the Support Button.We look forward to speaking with you. Only giving 5 stars so this can be seen. Left a review a few days ago, but looks like it didn't go through or got removed. So, again, this game is a lot of fun and occupies a lot of time, but it‚Äôs SO money hungry! The levels come close to nearly impossible (especially Jeromes/The Chicken‚Äôs levels) Like, how are you supposed to collect Stewies cups when your only getting Brian‚Äôs bones and Lois‚Äôs drinks the whole time and the freezer literally drops 2 of Stewie‚Äôs cups every 10 mins! I was stuck on that without any boosters left for 4 days straight! I hate when you do the challenges, that are already next to impossible without 50 boosts to help you, and once you finally beat it, you realize that if you lose the next round, you have to go back to level one and spend days tryna beat it AGAIN! It‚Äôd be nice if you could grab some coins in this game pretty frequently without having to buy a bundle pack for $6-$12 or more! Once your lives are gone, realize you have no boosts, no coins, not enough gems...You can‚Äôt help but put the game down and forget about it for weeks at a time! I swear these levels are rigged to take soooo long so that you‚Äôll finally lose patience and buy a bundle pack! It‚Äôs not worth it! Fun game, but the fun doesn‚Äôt last long at all!! I love this game! My only complaint is that the three challenges often have star requirements or a requirement to complete a task within a new level - that's great, but what about those of us who have no new levels to complete and who have collected all available stars? There should be an option to ask for a new challenge once we have completed all challenges that could be completed. Until new levels are added, those challenges are the only reasons to play levels I've already completed, so if I can't get new challenges until the old ones expire, then there's nothing for me to do.I was also curious about the picture of the level with the Greased-Up Deaf Guy - where is this in the game? Why is there a picture of a level that doesn't exist? Is it going to be released soon? I like new types of levels - they're fun! Hi there, we are sorry that you have this issue.

This gets frustrating at times, especially when I am trying to get one more game in.  I would have to click multiple times on something for it to work.  I know it‚Äôs not my WiFi, because my computer works, I know it‚Äôs not storage because other apps that take up more storage works.  Please fix this.  Thank you.I am currently using an iPhone 7 with an IOS as 11.3.1I‚Äôve been looking at the reviews more and I have come up with some ideas to keep the game fun even when you have it all.  Add multiplayer and each player has 5 points, they will use these points to buy boosts or to just upgrade their stuff.  Then, they will start until they both lose.  And with the money they just earned they could either buy more boosts or buy a new weapon if they have enough.  Next comes round two and that will be the last round, whoever lasts the longest wins.Another idea: Make it to where you can compete against your friends and you can keep all your own stuff, but they will just keep going until they both lose.I hope these ideas will be put to the game because I would really like to help the creators of this game.  Thanks for at least reviewing. üëç The game works great, I had it when I was younger and it was always fun, so I got it again to keep playing. However, I can‚Äôt buy anything in the store, which makes the game a bit boring since I can‚Äôt upgrade anything. I just downloaded the game and I‚Äôm running it on iOS 12.0 on an iPhone. Please fix!! So the actual game works fine. You press and hold it and when you let go, it smashes the people and objects. But when you get the shop screen and try to buy something, it‚Äôs like the buttons don‚Äôt work. You have to press it a couple of times for it to come up and then it goes away when you press too many times. It‚Äôs very irritating and the game would be fine with this simple fix. Thanks. "

Only complaint I can find is the graphics make some things hard to see, but that actually adds to the challenge. Multiple endings, plus amazingly enough developer offers soft reset with anything less than the ‚Äútrue‚Äù ending which is SO awesome, I rarely replay games just for a two second different ending, but this game lets you reset to right before you ended, so endings, and included extra puzzles, are totally worth playing! The game is overall very well done. The puzzles are challenging and make you think. While some will be obvious others will really challenge you. The game strikes a good balance as well with the hint system. Need a hint? Watch an ad. Still not enough? Ask for the answer. This system seemed extremely fair given the game is free. If I‚Äôm not paying for the game this is an excellent way to handle creating value for the developer. One complaint is although the graphics are good they try and obfuscate things by blending them into the background too much. I‚Äôm a veteran escape game player, and am bored with the same old cookie cutter games that don‚Äôt require thinking - just finding stuff and putting it in other stuff. This one makes you think outside the box and really problem solve. It‚Äôs tricky and I had to use the hints more than I‚Äôd like to admit, but I appreciate the progressive hints that don‚Äôt just give you the answer right away. Sometimes it was for stuff that I should have been able to figure out on my own, and others that just plain had me stumped. I‚Äôm looking forward to more from this developer! üëçüèª "

I‚Äôve been following your stuff for a while now and have downloaded all your games. This one in particular is quite possibly one of the best puzzle games I‚Äôve played so far. Not only does it change art styles constantly, but the music changes as well (both the art and music are beautiful as well). My favorite part, though, has to be the very unorthodox methods of solving puzzles. You have the normal variation of touch gestures, but you also have to move the phone around, shake it, use the volume buttons and the charging cable, etc. I love how it tells a story, too. The narrative is great. This is quite honestly one of my all time favorite mobile games and I am looking forward to future games. More art than game, immersive, and just great. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it other than a mysterious collage of everyday things blended into a puzzle game / story. It‚Äôs hard to understand at first but you get what you have to do clearly by the end. It‚Äôs pretty easy to do which is nice, this game‚Äôs focus isn‚Äôt on difficulty. Oh and the constantly changing music brings the whole thing to life and changes the atmosphere of each section. Reminds me a little of Vignettes in that way.I may be misinterpreting it but it seems like the story is about creativity and possibly imagination. And actually that‚Äôs kinda what the entire game is about.I can‚Äôt really describe the charm and intrigue to this game with words, so play it for yourself! I absolutely adored this game. I have never played anything like it before! Beautiful design, inventive puzzles, excellent soundtrack.... This game has everything you need to get lost in another world that is magical and moving.

The left and right button are too close to each other for, at least, me. At some points I would click one but since they are so close to each other, the system/game thinks I'm trying to press both and so Frisk won't move. And with that happening, I keep dying on the spikes and bones. This is still a great game but it would be nice to have the left and right buttons a little more away from each other...  :/ Undertale in my opinion is one of the best indie games out there because how the story holds up the characters are pretty good the locations have beautiful scenery to it end it still holds up to this day even if the fandom is crap I think it‚Äôs kind of a clever idea of making Undertale in the style of super Mario Bros but there are a couple of levels which I couldn‚Äôt get through Level 13 in the ruins has to be the worst of them because there are literally spikes you have to avoid and it‚Äôs tricky as hell I couldn‚Äôt even jump over them with Papyrus shooting those blue bones overall it‚Äôs a fine one but sometime later it might need some improvement on the hard levels "

The game is kind of like if overwatch and fortnite had a baby that was much more interesting to play. So what is the number 1 thing all fps players love? Cosmetics, something this game will offer for free in daily login  challenges and the season pass itself (even if you don‚Äôt pay). But what if you want to buy the season pass and your parents say no? Just save up, the free season pass will also offer the in game currency as a reward along with the login thing (which comes in generous amounts, but it would still take some time to save up for). I think as long as they reward people who level up their pass with decent rewards everyone is happy. I like the different game modes especially ranked, even though the randoms on my team give me a headache- it‚Äôs still fun and challenging. I await for the new features the devs add! I hope we gain a chat system or clans or even the ability to make friends and form teams, because in a team based game working together is necessary, along with having teammates you can depend on! So I hopped on this game thinking it was going to be another fun 5v5 fast paced arcade game to pass time and have fun. The first couple of games I noticed how off the controls and sensitivity are and how the fire modes have horrible aim on all sensitivity‚Äôs (no it‚Äôs not me, I played plenty of first person shooters and never have the issue with aiming.) when shooting it accelerates horribly and slowly even on the highest setting and goes faster at the worst times, it‚Äôs unbalanced. The game is also rigged, TDM goes up to 20 kills however the game ends in the end and you can notice that the other team doesn‚Äôt even have over 10 kills, meanwhile your team has 20 deaths because of bugs in the game that auto drain health (no I am not being shot by anyone because the other team is dead and respawning by this time, I run around many corners in hopes to get away but the bug just zaps my health.)  also the characters are HIGHLY unbalanced. The tank has high health which you have to unload two clips into him, but his weapon does so much damage that your only choice is to unload a clip, run and heal and hope that he‚Äôs a bot and hasn‚Äôt changed positions. Overall I don‚Äôt recommend this game in its current state and hopefully it improves somehow. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a one star is because it‚Äôs not a bad game, it just needs improvements. It‚Äôs like any other 5v5 fps, it just has too many bugs to Mark it as ‚Äúfun.‚Äù First off I love the game it‚Äôs really good I see nothing wrong with the game I literally play this game everyday nice work. Now things that should be added to this game to make it better and more fun 1. Y‚Äôall should add crouching, jumping, and either slide or jetpack. This should be added so that in battle is easier to take cover and to get to a safe spot. 2. Having the ability to change characters in game. I wish that this was a thing because if your in battle and you wanna use a different character you can‚Äôt So please add that. 3. Add more modes. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong tdm and domination (zone capture) there fun but you should add different modes and events. 4. Friends list and multiplayer private rooms. Now this made me a little sad that y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt add these but please do cause there are many times when I wanna play my friends and can‚Äôt do it. 5. Gun camos. This is nothing major just a little something to spice the game up. Yea that‚Äôs about it all y‚Äôall need to do is add those things in and it will be goodüëç. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

‚ÄéSomme Trench,"You're a fresh British infantryman at the Battle of the Somme, one of the longest, bloodiest battles of World War One. Can you survive a clash that kills almost twenty thousand of your countrymen on the first morning alone? ""Somme Trench"" is an interactive historical novel by Andrew J. Schaefer, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based‚Äîwithout graphics or sound effects‚Äîand fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Your best bet might be as an airplane gunner, or a trench fighter, or even as a stretcher bearer. Firing squads, brothels and homeward-bound steamships are all in your possible future.  Or you might give in to your inner demons and wind up chatting with ghosts and skeletons as though they're your friends. Whatever path you choose, you'll be immersed in a richly detailed, interactive historical novel that has almost as many twists and turns as there were soldiers at the Somme. ‚Ä¢ Immerse yourself in the world of the Western Front ‚Ä¢ Choose paths as diverse as infantryman, stretcher bearer or aircraft machine gunner ‚Ä¢ Learn about some of the most important events of world history ‚Ä¢ Challenge your mind ‚Ä¢ Enjoy a richly-detailed interactive novel with countless storylines ‚Ä¢ Solve mysteries embedded within the game",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/43/b0/87/43b08784-e891-3e54-3691-f757853e5529/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-0-4.png/1200x630wa.png,,5.0 ‚Ä¢ 23 Ratings,$2.99,,"June 28, 2018","I downloaded this game for the first time over a year ago. I've played through dozens of ways and still find different paths. This is a great game I've never experienced anything like this. You can laugh and smile at somethings and at others be heartbroken. I still remember my first play through. I love this game and no matter what I've always comeback to it at some point. It was very well made. Just to point out how much I like it this is the only game I'll ever write a review on. I can't stress how amazing it is without spoiling it. Anyways. Just. Get it it's. Amazing to say the least. No just the fighting and all that just. Get it. You won't be disappointed in the least. The one problem I have with this game is that I've been playing it for the past 7 hours straight. I've played through many times. I've died probably 10 times (mostly within the first 10 mins of fighting). It's a great game which actually has a lot of replay value. It's really interesting to see how each job you can have ties together and how a couple different choices can so greatly affect who lives and dies. Must have game right here! This is the first interactive fiction game that I played on mobile and almost certainly remains the best.It captures the tone of the war excellently and allows the player to take decisions that make for very different playthroughs.If you enjoy this, Divided We Fall, about the Spanish Civil War, makes for a strong follow-up.

Much more an old style turn based jrpg. However there are a lot of flaws.  Many bosses and monsters really create a frustrating experience making the game not fun overall.  Many bosses and monsters just spam negative effects or area of effect spells, and you spend most of your time reviving, healing and curing with any surviving characters.  You will blow through many dungeons just to find a boss obliterate you in 3 turns.   Even if you level up or change/ level up classes your hp are still very low and negative status effects hit at a very high rate. Often one charm spell charms my entire party.   Many boss battles I just got lucky, and I can't seem to get lucky on the last boss who often spams 4 area effect spells killing your entire party in one turn, even with the best eq and maxed skills/spells. There also isn't a skip button for conversations, since you will be fighting some bosses 10+ times hoping to get lucky and win, hearing the same conversation every time is tedious.Overall I like the genie concept, and style of game (although I will say you will be frustrated with how many levels have spike/lava floors! Seems the level designers love damage floors) however the balance of the bosses and how spells and effects hit makes the game very frustrating and not enjoyable. Touch Controls + Small Screen + Spikes = Does not work well together. This game is alright on iPad display but is kind of a nuisance on the iPhone. Game plot and gameplay is good like the others. I know these are old games being translated but if any more are being released I think the plot of ""empire"" needs to discontinue for a bit. There is too many currently revolving around the ""empire"". "

The fact that if an enemy is close to dying they can pause and they become invincible. That needs to change now! It's so annoying because so many wusses pause so they can starve you out and win. I would consider myself a pro and the fact that noobs can beat me by doing this is infuriating. Other than that it's a great game and I recommend it.

He‚Äôs figured out how to make a game where waging war on rotating cubes is, for all its intricacies, amazingly easy to get into. As bosses, teleporters, and other new wrinkles appear, the levels just get that much more fascinating‚Äîand incredibly fun to play. I love both the game itself and the visuals, which are in the neighborhood of Monument Valley‚Äôs minimalism without feeling like a wannabe.  It grows progressively more puzzling as unexpected twists in gameplay mechanics limit or altogether cancel out earlier, easier ways to kill the opponents.  This game makes me wrack my brain and look for patterns and think several moves ahead.  Still not all the way through it.  And when (if) I get to the end, a do-over awaits because the game judges and awards you if you can complete a given level in fewer moves and also tells you the fewest number of possible moves for each level.Oh and there‚Äôs a brain-bogglingly cool AR mode, in which you walk around the game instead of turning the game on the screen when your guy has been rotated to the opposite side.  Just bonkers.  I love it.  I‚Äôd give it 6 stars if I could.Also, there is a sequel called Euclidian Skies.  Just bought it today.  I hope it measures up to the very high standard the developers have set for themselves here.  Judging by the preponderance of 5 star reviews, I suspect it does. I actually enjoyed the game enough to give it a 5 plus. A little quirky using an iPhone, so my little guy didn‚Äôt always end up where I wanted.  I did navigate the game without one hint, walk-through or like, some parts were easy some not so. On the not so I would usually give it a rest, then tried again another day with better results.  One problem was being locked into one perspective on moves possible when you need to approach the puzzle a little differently.  Good example of that is the aligned bridge level.  If you‚Äôre good at 3-D space I‚Äôd give the game a try.  I have an iPhone seven and had no problems with it although it did eat through my battery life a little quicker than normal "

‚ÄéEncounter Challenge Calc,"Determining what constitutes an appropriate challenge for your party of heroes can be a real chore.  This app handles all the math for you, including modifiers for creature count and number of characters, so you can spend more time planning your adventure. First, describe the character levels that comprise your party.  The app can handle any reasonable number of characters, at levels up to 20.  You could, for example, specify that your party is made up of three level-4 characters, one level-5 character, and one level-6 character.  Once your party is defined, the app will tell you the XP thresholds appropriate for challenges of easy, medium, hard, and deadly difficulties. Those thresholds become the basis for a couple of other features: Creature Count per CR, and Custom Encounter Difficulty. Creature Count per CR is essentially a quick-reference chart which shows you the maximum number of creatures of each Challenge Rating that you can throw at the party to generate encounters of various difficulty.  For example, suppose you want the 5-member party described above to have a Hard encounter with some Challenge 2 creatures, such as ogres.  The chart will tell you that you'll need to use 4 of those creatures. Custom Encounter Difficulty is a calculator that allows you to define an encounter that consists of multiple, mixed CR creatures, and then tells you the difficulty of that encounter.  To illustrate, consider again our 5-member example party.  Using the Custom Encounter Difficulty calculator, you can create an encounter consisting of one CR1, two CR2, and one CR3 creatures, and it will tell you that this constitutes a hard encounter worth 3,600 XP.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/03/c3/a0/03c3a0c3-c1e0-4a77-e54a-97b2ecc9733f/pr_source.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.0 ‚Ä¢ 2 Ratings,$0.99,,"August 1, 2015","Not bad, much easier than doing it manually.

Core to Stellar Horizon is that its virtual galaxy, including the stars and planets, are all created through random procedural generation using deterministic algorithms. A single seed number is used to create these features via mathematical computation thus eliminating the need to create each of these features by hand. This enables the game to have a massively open nature: it is estimated that with the 32-bit seed number, Stellar Horizon virtual galaxy will include over 4 billion planets. Any player will be able to visit a specific planet once they know its galactic coordinates, given their spacecraft has the capability to do so, and find the same features as any other player, as these coordinates serve as the seed for the planet's topography and environment.",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/de/2f/ac/de2fac4a-6a8d-7d39-bfe5-11b021f24729/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-6-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png,explore the infinite space,3.8 ‚Ä¢ 49 Ratings,$2.99,,"March 26, 2020","*Updated review below*I'm having quite a bit of fun playing this. It's a solid space exploration/sandbox game. It has solid yet basic exploration, combat and trading gameplay. I am looking forward to seeing where this can go. I am surprisingly impressed with the implementation of the planetary landing and exploration. The gameplay is basic but surprisingly engaging. My only major criticisms are the difficulty of selecting stars (the star map doesn't help) and a lack of content, but the latter is understandable given the life of this project. Thanks!Update: Ive jumped back into this game since I first reviewed this game a year ago, and the author has added a bunch of features. Planets now have flaura/fauna and explorable bunkers. Ships feature power management now. There are some graphical tweaks as well. This game is still fun and I forward to even more features to expand exploration, trading and fights! I really wish more games in the app store had the feeling of exploration that this one does.  My dream features would be:-Smooth/real-time exploration of planet surfaces -Selectable planets in navigation map -More things to interact with in space (minable asteroids, discoverable things in solar systems, etc) This is the only game on an iPhone that can match other games like elite dangerous so well. Most other games are over the top shoot em ups, but this game is so much more. With a whole economy and guild system it gets really in depth. Depending on the player this can be a good or bad thing. It will be a lot harder to learn and master but when you do, it can give so much content in return. It feels like every day I find something new that I had no idea was in the game such as wormholes, dinosaurs/life, monoliths, and so much more so when u find them it feels like you are progressing. Overall this is a great game that is tough around the edges but if u can get over the graphical quality, controls, and the depth and complexity of the game and want a game to relax to and play any way you want, this is the best to get.This game is great if you are an avid player of games like elite dangerous and no mans sky. This is the game I‚Äôve been looking for! I purchased and started playing (on IPad mostly) just a few days ago and I‚Äôm really enjoying this game. It‚Äôs more in the lines of space exploration, which is what I‚Äôve been looking for. It‚Äôs also nice to play a game that you don‚Äôt get targeted all the time and get a chance just to enjoy exploring. This game has many bells, whistles, and choices and I found it relatively easy to play. I‚Äôm not the greatest at battling attackers when it happens but the nice thing is the developer doesn‚Äôt make you start all over from scratch. Also nice to pay one price and play! Nicely done and looking forward to continuing play and future updates. "

I managed to (somehow) get about 700 trophies on this game, but it would be a lot easier if the other players you fight weren't all bots. The only way you can play with teammates that aren‚Äôt bots is if you manage to gather friends, but even then you‚Äôre always fighting against bots that usually don‚Äôt do anything.  Obviously taking a lot of inspiration from Supercell‚Äôs Brawl Stars, an app that I can gladly say is my favorite mobile game, Super Cats could have some great potential if it decided to separate itself from blatantly trying to be like other apps or famous characters, and try to implement a unique idea into their game. My favorite game is brawl stars so if a game copy it they should make it better and not horible. And it copys all the characteristics of the brawlers in brawl stars and 2 or 3 days happened to me that when I left the game and then enter again all my progress is not there. And to if you want to have the idea of an other game do not do all the same you need to do it better and have your own ideas and not copy all of the game. But I said this to MOBA games they need to improve in this because it copy almost all of brawl stars. And sorry if this get you mad but is the true so improve in this game because people will begin to annoy you with the very bad comments. So DO NOT COPY BRAWL STARS WELL YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF BRAWL STARS TO DO A GAME BUT DO NOT COPY ALL THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BRAWL STARS please and am not saying at all that this game is ALL bad. And do not get mad with me please Like brawl stars but a bit different. I love the battle royale and would play it any day of the week over brawl stars showdown but thats about it all the only thing different about the characters in this game compared to brawl stars is the designs they function the exact same and also one map? Seriously? I‚Äôd rather have the map rotation in brawl stars. But I think I like it more than other brawl stars fans "

Still, I got through the first pass  and hoped that would be it, looking forward to getting back to the frame game. But you have to keep playing it at various stages. While you can skip some of the sequences, there are others involving timed movement which are just impossible. I gave up at the ""swimming past rocks"" sequence. I tried repeatedly, asked my partner (who is a skilled RPG player and has great reflexes), and we both gave up after about 30 minutes. Maybe it's because it's a port to iOS but these fast-reflex challenges seem literally unplayable on iPad. Please consider allowing players to skip GWIG completely! Or make the challenges non-time-dependent. GWIG can be a fine concept, but if not executed well, it shuts the whole gameplay down, and I've had to simply give up. Main part of the game is fun, the fantasy mini game would've been fun if the controls were easier to handle. I was stuck at the part where you need to swim through the moat, and because the controls aren't very responsive, I kept bumping into the rocks. Should've used the d-pad from one of the previous escape sequences or been given the option to skip the part entirely. I just gave up and uninstalled the game, since it seems I'm not able to finish it without completing the mini game. Would've been fun to play otherwise, I'm sure. Very difficult to solve some of these scenes, and I'm a pretty seasoned adventure gamer. It would be nice if there were : 1) hints 2)instructions for ALL mini games (including 'snake' - horrible game that didn't make sense)3) less dialogue Not a fan of the 8bit game in game, plus it was too hard to figure out at times- glad there were some skips on that. I also found myself googling the walk through most of the game. If it wasn't for that I would've given up.     Storyline is good, twist good,but I agree with a previous review that keeping track of characters was confusing, not to mention I didn't development an emotional attachment to them- probably bc during the dialogue there is only a still pic of them while dialogue is typed out;  so when the twist came, I was like, Oh.....K....? (but there was another little twist at the very end {the girl} which I liked)All that said, I still gave it 4 stars bc graphics were great, liked the story, the effort and teamwork to make these games is something to applaud, and I would like to see more games in the future üòäThank you dev's!!üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº "

I‚Äôve read complaints here that it was too short but I played almost two days, ot sure how many more there were to go, but at the amusement park the last item to find was outside the realm of the picture.  I would wait for the clue to recharge and each time it went further and further into the darkness.  I gave it a high rating because I‚Äôve been playing these hops about a month now and of all the developers this was the cheapest and didn‚Äôt start looping or breaking about half an hour in and there‚Äôs no way to get your money back.  Some I really like you cannot buy, everything is in-game purchase and can end up costing a lot more than a few bucks to play if you want to continue for awhile which I sgurely would do.  That‚Äôs the problem, it‚Äôs either free with ads, simple pay a couple bucks to rid ads, very interesting but everything costs, or like this one good price got a couple days entertainment. When I played the game it was fun and interesting. Some small issues like some objects were impossible to find because they blended into the background too much, even adjusting the brightness didn't help. Finished the whole game in 2 hours. For the price, it should have been 3 or 4 times the length as others in this genre are, so its very hard to justify the price with so many other games out there for this price at an appropriate length.  Unicorrn castle would be a more worthy buy. The cost for this game was way overpriced!  I finished in less than 52 minutes.  It was, at the most, $1.99 worth of fun.  Hardly challenging except for trying to figure out some of their translations into English and trying to see into the dimly lit scenes (even with my brightness to the max). "

(never thought i would say that lol) Thanks so much for your nice review, we're glad you like it! We'll adjust the tips in the next update but in the meantime: keep your streak going by collecting all the eggs in order, avoid the obstacles, play reasonably quickly and you'll get 3 stars! It doesn't matter how you draw the picture- you can draw it however you like, but keeping the streak going is really important! We'll simplify this a little and make it clear- thanks for the suggestion :) This is such a well designed game and attention to detail unparalleled. You collect eggs but it is so much much more than that. You have to avoid obstacles as well along the way and after all is done, you‚Äôve actually drawn a picture... clever concept. This game is fun and beautiful to play, the controls are fluid and exact. This truly is a fantastic game overall. I love this game! I‚Äôve been searching for months for something new to play but every other game out seems like the same gimmick. Finally one that isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmatch three in a row‚Äù puzzle!! I love the creativity behind this game. It‚Äôs quick and addictive; easy to play while sitting on the couch watching tv. You play by collecting eggs with a vehicle, while avoiding obstacles, and end up drawing a picture with your path. One thing I haven‚Äôt figured out is how to improve my score in each level. It seems like each level is basically pass/fail, but I‚Äôm unsure about the variables which contribute to the score. Also you can purchase different vehicles  with golden eggs, but it is unclear the benefits of each one. For example one might be faster, or take less damage from obstacles, or is more fuel efficient.

While I enjoy both of the concepts and definitely the art and story telling of both games, I find it a little challenging to think about playing the games without purchases. While they both didn‚Äôt require to have money spent on them, I bought gems and such for DangerousFellows and Maxed the energy levels on MayDay Memories. I love both of the games and their different mechanics, but I think it would have been increasingly difficult for me to play the game without spending money. As it‚Äôs known, you can watch adds for energy refills and purchase them with gems, but I believe that the energy costs later in the stories are expensive and it would take a normal player that hasn‚Äôt spent money on the game at least 2-3 days to complete one episode. Other than that, I love the story in both of these games, and am very impressed with the story of Mayday Memories. I wished that there could have been a ‚Äúhappier‚Äù ending in the normal route, but aside from that, I think this game is great! So good work to the LucyDream group for creating such a great game and story!!!! Hello, this is Lucydream.Thank you for your review! We listen to and consider all your feedback when creating future games and content. Try going for one of the special endings, as one of them might be more to your liking! ;) I really lime the game. I like the protagonist and I really anticipate her having her own name since there's usually a little cognitive dissonance for me with these type games. (For example, if I'm playing as myself then it's a little weird if the choices I'm given don't line up with my actual reactions but since this a different character I'm all for it!) I really like the characters and pretty much everything about it. However I don't like how the game makes you spend more energy the deeper you go into the story. A lot of the extra stuff takes some time to get to if you're like me and can't or don't want to pay for much. Aside from the small stuff I fully recommend the game!Edit: OK, the fact that I have to spend more energy the more chapters I read is really getting on my nerves! What is the point to it?! All it does is slow the reader down and drafts everything out. Ten energy points was fine, fifteen was OK (I wasn't happy about it but I could live), but now the chapters take up around 30 energy points and that means there isn't enough left it do much in the actual story! SERIOUSLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE CHAPTERS SO PRICY MAKE THE ENERGY FILL UP HIGHER THE FARTHER YOU GO, FIND WEBSITES WHICH GIVE YOU ENERGY POINTS AND DON'T GIVE UNGODLY NUMBERS OF QUESTIONS JUST TO GET EVEN A CHANCE AT GETTING ENERGY, OR JUST MAKE ALL THE CHAPTERS THE SAME PRICE!!! I have not encountered such great galgame for a while. Although I still do not think the main storyline is an A(In my heart it is a B+), but man, the romance development writing tho!!! I have not encountered such a good writing in galgame in years! No sexy selling elements,  no cg selling, just pure logical, heartwarming conversations. They are truly great and natural, which is so rare in galgame. So natural and still here and there, something will make u sense the flirtation which is so kind and flirty at the same time. The writers are very good at developing relationship and reveal characters. I truly appreciate this story and the effort putting into writing it.(PS: thank u for the existence of Hansol. He is perfect in every way. Thank you for creating him. The humor, wow. Pls make sure the ppl working to make him and others read this comment and know that the effort was appreciated and I don‚Äôt usually speak so high of a romance game characters) "

If you make a certain choice that ends in you battling the Maekir unit, and decide to ""take down"" Jotun and arrest them all, the story hiccups to the option where you kill Jotun after some writing that makes no sense both order and option wise. Would really appreciate a fix, thank youEdit: soon after writing this, after having killed Jotun unwillingly, I chose the option to troubleshoot Anima and the writing makes it sound as if she killed Jotun instead, probably something that happens if you make different choices? Anyways, just another problem, thanks. With the quality of latest hosted games I didn't have much hope for this one but it surprised me. It was well written and the story was pretty good.

D. D. It's a lot of fun being that you progress so quickly and always level up so you feel good at the game even when you're new and when the game does get tough you just Prestige then your power more powerful than before. There is A lot of content for such a simple game even if you live a busy life style your character continues to play even when you're not actively playing.  I recommend you try it out.  I guarantee you will love it. I've played for over a year and still continue to move up and put up a good contest in tournaments. Plus it's free and the in game purchases don't make you that strong so they're not necessary. So may the BEST man win not the RICHEST. I really want to love this game, and do love many aspects of it, but even after numerous communications to the developers (with only limited and extraordinarily slow response in return) I remain immensely frustrated by the effect of hacker/cheaters in tournaments, and especially the extremely obvious ones in the Heroes Tournaments!Better rule enforcement is needed to prevent individuals from exceeding the limits of normal gameplay to rise to the top of the tournament roster with end-game levels within the first hour or two of the tournament, and clearly with several times the scores of the best normal players below them. I have screenshots from numerous tournaments that clearly demonstrate that this is happening, and continue to forward them to the developers, but without any apparent concern on their part to update Tap Titans against the hacks, now that Tap Titans 2 is out. It is totally unfair to all the players who are trying to play the original game fairly!Unfair play aside, this game has many worthy attributes, and would otherwise be worthy of a top rating. Developers, please fix the hacker problem, for as long as this shameful situation continues, it stands as a black mark against your prowess as programmers, and lowers our interest in any of Game Hives's other offerings! It's a pretty good time waster. It's fun pushing the limit to see how far you can get before you prestige. Each time you prestige, you get X amount of relics. The amount of relics you earn is based off of your characters level, your group level, and the stage in the game you reach. You use the relics to buy artifacts which give you a variety of bonuses such as additional damage, or more dropped gold while playing. It's a pretty fun game, but can get boring. When it gets boring for me, I just let my characters grind for me offline, and when I open the game again, level them up, advance to a stage proportionate to my team's strength, and close the game. So either way you want to play, I think it's fun. I did buy the lowest possible amount of diamonds to get rid of the ads, so it makes the game a little more bearable. One final bit, I would not recommend spending diamonds on anything except buying things for your character, and there's no need to actually spend cash for diamonds. You get plenty of free ones in game through drops, events, ads, and weekly login awards. "

It also has the bonus scare factor. No glitches, runs smoothly with easy menu options. I enjoyed looking for the bonus paintings and such.  The puzzles given were also well done offering variety and a decent challengeThe Bad: My problem is more with the everyday object finding (all the little things you need to get to open a door, a journal or a cupboard).  It was a constant back and forth motion that got so tedious.  For example, you would need a flower shaped object for a drawer. In the next room, you find it and then return to the drawer to open it. That drawer had another object for a drawer somewhere else. You go there and that one had a piece for the original room.  Basically you went in circles. I would find a leaf for example, forget where it went and have to use the Hint button to remember.  Then again I would use it only to find an object needed for the room I was just in.  Also the Finding Object areas were not very challenging.  In fact they were too easy (they were in plain sight and never hidden very well).In the end, I didn't hate the game but it was definitely not a favorite. Greetings, Gamers: üëÑA big sweeping bow and curtsy to the fine devs @ Elephant. What an excellent job they've done with this game: haunting atmospherics, good storyline, great graphics and music and scariness to boot!I actually got the heebie-jeebies hearing the moaning cries for help and knocking coming from nowhere...and everywhere!Puzzles were interesting and varied as were the HOS. Collectibles were fun to keep an eye out for (when I wasn't looking over my shoulder!)Glitch-free, this game had incredible fluidity unlike anything else I've experienced here lately. Transport map was smooth and efficient. A wonderful wink of the eye and nice touch: the orphan photos are actually baby pics of the game devs as tykes. It was fun reading their English/Anglo names then flipping them over to read their names in their native language and job title. Quite clever!The secret room is a nice bonus. Going back in now to beat my original time.Want some spooky fun, thrills and chills? Give this game a go and enjoy an early Halloween treat. I see there's another one in the works, can't wait!Way to go, mighty Pachyderm!üëçüèºüëèüèΩüòéUntil next time, fellow gamersMay the haunted stars light your way‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üåò‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üï∏‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üòµ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üíã‚ú®‚ú®‚ú® "

When I played the game, it was upside down and couldn't fix it. The menu screen and the bullets, life, dialogue, and the level were just fine and right side up, plz fix. Purchased the headset that the game came with. I was very excited to play and once I set everything up, I was disappointed. The controls are bad, the remote itself feels as if it will fall apart when pressing buttons, AND the actions in the game are delayed by at least 3-4 seconds. Can‚Äôt say I was very pleased with this experience... This game lags a lot. The remote fails to connect most of the time. The earbuds ALSO don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm returning the entire thing tomorrow. I am happy I saved the receipt for this... For those who posted that they cannot get above level 4 it is because this is only  an entry game to let you see how it looks like. If you buy the $1.99 app you can go much further and better zombies with greater strength. Enjoy but you should try the paid app. "

It is a standard left to right action game with similarities / flavors of older titles such as Ghost House for the Sega Master System or Phantom Fighter for the NES. It involves moving from 1 starting location to the exit (Usually a door) to complete SED level. At which point you proceed to the next level. Action is carried out by shooting your enemies with a hand gun.Graphics:Since this is a port of an older J2me title it has that 16bit visual feel all over it. (one of the reasons I was sucked in to buy it) The graphics do the job of giving you that Splaterhouse or Ghost House feel but only lightly and do not make use of any parallax or multilayer scrolling that is usually found in almost all true older 16bit games of this type during the late 80's and early 90's. Frames of Animation are decent for what there is and horribly lacking for what there isn't. Your walking animations and gun firing animations are cute enough but there is absolutely NO jumping animation! Your character just begins to hover up and to the right or left, and then land. What...??? Even your enemies display a decent amount of frames when provoked or die, so why the lazy programming. (we will get to that later).Sound:I was actually surprised in this department! There seems to be 2 short eerie tunes that switch each level and last about 10 to 15 seconds in length before repeating. Not bad if you consider that this is an older J2me port. Most didn't have any music let alone sound effects unless it was from a major company like Gameloft or EA. Even the sound effects shocked me considering the source material. They had well sampled gun fire and death sound for the enemies and weapons.Control:This is where it all begins to fall apart and show how much effort (or lack there of) was put into this Iphone port. In the move from the J2me format where only 1 button press could be recognized at a time to the Iphone, nothing was changed! You still can only use one action button or movement button at a time. We are still in 2009 right? We didn't all take a step to the left and go through the time warp again did we? This to me along with the lack of animation and cut and paste jumping that reeks of early cell phone games in NO way justifies the $1.99 they are asking.Conclusion:I was sucked in by the decent 16bit ish looking art and theme. DO NOT GET SUCKED IN AS WELL BY THIS TRAP! This is a very BARE bones direct port of a really old J2me cell phone game that takes absolutely no advantage of the Iphone's capabilities! That coupled with a $1.99 asking price is pure madness in this APP market. If there was a .50 app selection I would still not recommend it. Another example of a company suckering the good people on the APP store out of their hard earned money! Contrary to what has been written, I like it. I LOVE the spooky music!!! It's cool adds a really nice touch!! It's playable. It's a platform game, I'm biased to platform games, there's not enough here in the app store, and the graphics could be better, but it's pretty fun. "

Great art, great characters, love that you can occasionally choose what answers the characters give. My biggest issue is that bathroom and shower brakes.  They barely give energy as is....why make it harder to keep them. It‚Äôs almost pointless to have them. Also, we should be able to use whatever amount of energy we have left to go towards tress, rocks, etc, to help knock down the cost. So if a tree is 114 but your top limit is 72, you should be able to use all 72 toward that tree so you can go back later maybe finish knocking it out. It seems like it‚Äôs awful difficult to accumulate the amount needed. Granted I‚Äôm currently only level 13, so maybe once you get a little higher it‚Äôll be slightly easier???? Also the current holiday love island and bird island seem almost impossible to get through unless you‚Äôre paying for gems to get dynamite. I had to stop wasting my energy on those cause I‚Äôm not really getting anywhere. I understand you need to make money too but it shouldn‚Äôt be impossible. Throw an occasional ad for energy or something to help. Thank you very much for your review concerning our game. We are always collecting user feedback and emails that we can apply with updates. We've forwarded your feedback to our developers. Thank you for taking out the time to send us your suggestions! Update: After almost completing the treasure island and making and finding the time pieces my fountain still won‚Äôt update! Pease help. When I started this game it was so exciting and fun. I stayed up till 5 in the morning unable to put it down and it quickly became my favorite game. I deleted most of my other games and just played this one. Today I am very frustrated with it. Usually when a new island opens you will get a lot of items that give energy and play for a long time. Since the start of the new treasure island yesterday I haven‚Äôt been able to move anywhere. As soon as I get energy it‚Äôs gone with one item and I have to wait several hours just to spend less than 2 minutes of play. I‚Äôm so upset. I‚Äôm an older disabled person and this is my escape. I finished the last treasure island way ahead of time. I found all the time pieces and cleaned the island. Still my fountain never updated! This new mission looks like I‚Äôll never get it finished and finding the pieces are almost impossible do to the lack of energy. Even the videos you can watch to earn rubies has become limited. After two videos it says I have to wait 8 hrs before I can open those trunks or collect rubies on the shore. Why did it change?  I hope you can fix this. I really wanted to give you 5 stars but I‚Äôm just so aggravated! Thank you. I was having a great time with this game until the Christmas event. First it came in early and completely broken and I was wondering if it was even fixable but really the game just needed to update. It updated and got fixed and my event progress got reset as expected. Then i played through the event a second time and got quite far into star island before it got reset...again. Apparently there were more bugs that needed to be fixed so progress needed to be reset and thankfully the time got reset too. But the second play through i bought the smallest gem pack and collected some gems that i specifically used to buy energy so I could get stuff done quickly and progress in the Christmas event. Now i received 300 gems for my progress getting reset and was told that I would get my gems i spent also in the event time refunded back to me so id be officially at square one with compensation for having to do it again. But i never received my extra gems. I went to support and they repeated you got your gems in every way possible without actually helping me with the situation. I paid money but they really didn‚Äôt care about giving me compensation for that money that i paid which turned me off of the game almost immediately after. I really liked the game but I dont want to play it anymore because if I encounter a problem that only affects me directly I know I wont get the needed support. "

So when I found this game, I thought it would be fun to try out, especially since it had been made accessible with VoiceOver. Three days later and I've been totally sucked in! I have no idea how to use the soulwells. Can I choose what is made from them, or do they just randomly create whatever I may need at any given time? Nevertheless, I have been enjoying myself and this sure beats worrying about the dreaded COVID-19. If there was a way to support the game (I already bought the Gold version right after downloading this even before knowing anything about what it offered), I would do so. Perhaps there could be a tip jar to support this project and its continued expansion. I'm glad I am not compelled to keep spending money, but I would like to throw in some clams from time to time to express my gratitude, both for making this accessible and for keeping me hooked with all the different monsters. Absurd underlings has been my favorite so far. Thank you again for an idle adventure that has kept me coming back for more. It‚Äôs super addicting and fun to play! I have some suggestions though for new features. 1)Allow players to buy upgrades to speed up building new buildings. There‚Äôs instructors to speed up training your army but not anything to speed up constructing buildings. 2)Allow for an option to place shamans on two aspects of soul wells, or be able to choose how many shamans on each, such as 3 on fruiting and 4 on growing for example. 3)An option to direct attacks on certain character types or on strength. Kinda like bloons tower defense, let us pick where our damage wants to go on an opposing army such as on the strongest troops first or on a specific class like healers. If these features were added to the game, it would be 100% my favorite game this year, and without them it still is a fantastic game! I almost never write reviews, but this game definitely deserves. There are a few minor bugs and thing here and there, but all in all it is very fun. I noticed when the Kobold‚Äôs come in to the story, they say they will levy 30% of food, but they actually take much less. Also, it would be cleaner if without the decimal points in the 1/10‚Äôs place. I‚Äôm a long time incrementalist, and this hails strongly to ‚ÄúA Dark Room‚Äù with a few key changes. Also a note to the developer, please decrease the number of resources requires to build later stage houses, at a certain point they become very difficult to obtain. "

First of all, I would have given this game 5 stars without a second thought if not for an awful bug at the end of chapter 3. I cannot proceed past chapter 3 into chapter 4, whenever I press the continue button and try to, the game crashes. I have also tried clicking the chapters button and accessing it from there. The same thing happens, the entire game crashes. I really want to finish this game because it is so well made, unique, and compelling. So, I urge the developers etc. to please fix this bug as soon as possible. As well as another one I encountered in chapter 3. So, in chapter 3 Boris is supposed to open the door to Alice Angel. However, he got stuck and wouldn‚Äôt move at an open door a few feet away from the one he was supposed to fix. By using the elevator and going to random floors and coming back, I was able to fix it. But it was still very annoying so please fix that too. Otherwise, the game is great and would 10/10 recommend. Ok so first great game I beat all five chapters in like 2 hours I have been hoping that bendy would come to iPhone I have been watching markiplier and jacksepticeye play it Ever sense it was released back in 2017 and been a fan of it ever since also I loved that you put in your little meatly cameos and that jacksepticeye and DAgames had cameos to! But now on to the bug so when I played the game again I was in chapter three and I got the tommy gun and listened to Henry‚Äôs secret audio log and and I got to the end the elevator wouldn‚Äôt move and now I have to restart my game so if you can fix that that would be great well in the words of Wally franks I‚Äôm out of here! Ok so I know I mentioned the elevator a couple months ago and this is kinda a stupid question but I was wondering if you could make a setting in chapters 1 2 and 3 Ware we could switch it to the old chapters back to the remastered chapters I know you guys are working bendy and the dark revival but if you guys could do that that would be awesome sorry to bug you also are you guys making bendy and the dark revival for the switch play station Xbox and phone like this one? Sorry got excited when the trailer came out I love Bendy. Having been a fan since chapter 1 first came out, I was delighted to see a mobile version now that the game has been completed. However, there seems to be a bug in chapter 3. I‚Äôve tried to play it multiple times, but because the level is so big, I don‚Äôt have the time to complete it in one sitting. This is no problem in chapters 1 and 2, since I can save and exit the level/game. However, this doesn‚Äôt work in chapter 3. I exit the game fine, but when I try to play it from where I left off, I end up stuck in the elevator with none of the buttons working and the doors closed. When I look at the objective, it says to take the pipe, plunger, etc. But I‚Äôm already holding the item. I end up having to start a new game completely, and after three or four times of this, it gets very tiring. I love everything else about Bendy, and since these kind of bugs happen to even the best developers, I‚Äôve still decided to give the game 5 stars anyway. (though I would still love it if you fixed this bug) "

It was very cute, very relaxing, but also very riling. The game play was really nice. I thought the fact that Sosuke chose when he wanted to leave was nice. That way it didn‚Äôt really feel like an obligation, but that he/you really wanted to explore these places. I use he/you that way, because this game REALLY DOES make you invested in it and like want to go to these different places. See what they‚Äôre like. Plus the storyline. Ugh, don‚Äôt even get me started. It was so- Cool! That‚Äôs the only other way I can put it. I personally, was hoping that Sosuke would decide to stay on the island where he‚Äôs happy, but he does need to be with his mother. I feel like I also learned things that he learned with him. He really learned to understand her better and I think that was a really nice idea for it. I genuinely cried at the end, though. Seriously developers. I was in search of a nice game that I wouldn‚Äôt get tired of. And that was this. Though it was short, it brightened my day every time!!! So 1) Thank you and 2) Great job. This was perfect in my eyes. <3 Having played the other games of this developer, I must say this is their best work yet. They clearly put a lot of love and effort into their games. The games are not much in gameplay and are almost all about the story (much like a visual novel game), which I throughly appreciate. This one in particular is very relatable and hits so close to home! I highly recommend for anyone and everyone to play this game. You won‚Äôt regret all those peaceful minutes you spend in the beautiful world. It has some sad moments, some happy ones, and some funny ones too! Everything you need for an emotional adventure is right here in this little game. Please feel free to pick it up and support the amazing developers! This game is a true stress reliever- it‚Äôs simple to play with an engaging story that doesn‚Äôt force you or manipulate you into buying anything to actually play. There is a power up that makes the game completely effortless to play and there are occasional ads that give you rewards, but they‚Äôre inconsequential and not really needed unless you‚Äôre trying to speed through the game. I finished this game in about a week, maybe less, and I honestly wish it were a bit longer only because I was having so much fun. 100% recommend this game, along with the developers earlier titles such as the Showa Candy Shop series.

It moved me enough to buy and play the game on my phone, and I find myself liking it as much as I like the Witcher 3 or Fallout 4. These games are absolutely not similar though. I really enjoy the story. I can't say why ""spoilers"" voice acting, though be it in Japanese, is great. As you read along with the voice, it feels like the actor speaks English, definitely recommend This is basically the exact same game as the PSP Version, but a few things... bother me. One: the typeface is set to either Arial or Times New Roman, one of the two. It doesn‚Äôt really look good at all. Two: The game is seemingly locked at like, 300 FPS. Everything is way too fast, to the point where the Wrong End screen gets cut off VERY fast. Otherwise, it‚Äôs the same game with relatively few changes. "
‚ÄéEmber,"About Ember ‚ÄúBack in the earliest days, there was no sun and the world was dark. The heavens opened up and stars fell like beacons into the pitch black world, and they were known as ‚ÄúEmbers‚Äù. Powerful and wise druids of a primordial race, ‚Äúthe Lightbringers,"" roamed the orb searching for this luminous matter. They performed a ritual of awakening to call the ‚ÄúEmbers‚Äù out of their deep sleep. Suddenly the world became bright, and the veil of darkness was lifted. The Embers were the embodiment of magical flame, light, and life, but as word spread about the sheer power of the Embers, they came to be hunted and captured‚Ä¶and so the War for Ember began‚Ä¶‚Äù  From the tome ‚ÄúRestoration of the Lightbringer‚Äù  Gameplay overview A passion project 10 years in the making, Ember is a homage to classic role-playing games. Ember features a deep branching story, endless exploration across dynamic and living environments, a robust skill tree, and an intricate crafting system. In Ember, players are resurrected as a ‚ÄúLightbringer‚Äù and summoned to protect the dying Embers as the world is on the brink of collapse. Beginning in the Deep Barrows, players traverse vast environments divided between aboveground and underground realms ‚Äì ranging from lush forests to dry deserts and dark abysses ‚Äì to reach the City of Light. The story unfolds through encounters with strangers, and players are forced to decide their destiny by making pivotal decisions.

As a gamer I can immerse myself into their world and feel the meticulous details. Great character design, landscape, music, voice recording, and effects. Thank you for a wonderful game. Now comes the ""BUT"", and this bit of irate is magnified by the perfection in every other aspect so far I have experienced. The blemish lies in the dialogues and literature of the world. If only the developers hired writers with higher proficiencies the game would be complete. The writing style is of a modern teenager's attempt being a bard or historian which breaks the immersion. And the protagonist sounds less like a legendary warrior and more of a pleading child. I only point it out because this would otherwise have been a standard bearer for iOS isometric RPGs. Hope to see more from developers in the future, and a writing quality on par with Baldur's Gate. The good: Nice graphics with bright colors and buildings that pop out at you. Basic crafting system, not overly complicated. Plenty of quests. Open world.The bad: Would be much better on an iPad, the buttons are so tiny that they‚Äôre hard to hit. Combat feels over simple without many strategic elements. Text trees almost all seem to lead to the same result, regardless of what‚Äôs said. Overt political bias of developers in storyline. Minimal differences in three character classes. The status and menu bars block the screen enough to significantly detract from the pretty graphics. The characters look small as little ants, if you zoom in, it remains fixed on your main character so it‚Äôs tough to zoom in and just focus on things unless he‚Äôs near them. The main character seems empty, hollow, unrelatable, boring, even in his picture. I did win the game, but never felt a huge amount of satisfaction. It would have been better with a little bit more freedom to change the outcome of quests, more text trees with varying outcomes, more strategy in combat, more variety of the classes, and an interface that better suited iPhones without teeny buttons. Just to name a few things. Probably an option for less experienced RPG fans who are looking for a simpler experience and have an iPad. This game is great and worth the price. My only complaint is, as playing as an iPhone player, the controls can be frustrating. My complaints are only with movement. I click on an enemy to attack but the character will move next to the enemy and not attack. Or I will want to move and click on an object instead. Other than that this game is quite addicting and well worth playing if you like challenging rpg's. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

You can get coins and gems easily and the add level is chill. I recommend if you like battle royals but your no good at them or want a royal pixielized. One complaint though is that the crates are not as fair as they should be. I realize the reason they did this is because it‚Äôs so easy to get the coins to buy them but still, they should be easier to get entire items instead of just 1 part. Or make the amount of parts you get more. Overall I rate this four stars just because of the crates thing plus I don‚Äôt like the skins that much and there‚Äôs only one map. I recommend. Thanks! Before the update, the game wasn‚Äôt fun, there was no auto attack, so now there is, and it‚Äôs so much fun, the chat is very peaceful, and you don‚Äôt have to bother about people cussing and stuff. One thing I would change is the way we get our skins, and we should team up with more people. But other than that, the game is pretty good.

I see my review from wayyy back is still on the poster for this game to sucker in players. While in some ways this is still one of the closest to the original 8 pages game, in terms of graphics and such, the game desperately needs to return to its roots with earlier versions. The sheer number of ads that bombard the player takes away from the excitement, and its annoying how often they pop up on both the menu and everytime the player dies it asks if youd like to see an ad to continue. The life bar at the top is another thing that needs to go. Part of the fear factor in playing this is in not knowing when or if slenderman would get you. The depletion of the bar is a giveaway that your about to die and coupled with the fact that slenderman makes you look at him, its also cheap. Keep the face cam and everyplay record and share features however. Its cool to be able to let others see your replays. The new levels are good add ons as well. While i can take or leave the slender coin feature, some of the features you can get with them (night vision additional levels and a page finder) are cool. Keep these but do away with continues. In short, Return this game to being more like past versions from 4 or so years ago and perhaps keep the share features. Its annoying as hell to play as is. So... what makes good horror games? The answer is kind of complicated, and since this is really a simple game I will shorten the list. First off: atmosphere! The dark forest and sounds really set off a good place to die. Humans are social beings, and being alone is one of our major weaknesses, and Slender takes advantage of that. While this game is really difficult it is possible. The more pages you collect, the more aggresive Slender gets, following right behind your every step. Tension is also a big factor: you see the page, and get a rush of elation. But you see a gaunt face peeking out of the trees. Just the fact that you have to get the pages, but Slender might already be their makes it kinda creepy.While the game to play is not very scary (the enclosed ones like warehouse are creepier because sometimes you have to turn around and Slender might be there) sometimes it really gets your heart pounding. For me, the scariest part is whenever you are home in the dark, you remember this game, and don't want to move. However, it is much like Slender on the PC. The controls can be a little iffy at times, but it adds to the 'oh god' element of horror.ENJOY! "

I wouldn't honestly change anything expect for the gems(rubies). I think that's too much, some people don't have money to buy the gems because you only give us 30 at the beginning and if we use it, we can't get it back unless we buy it for 2.99 at the cheapest price. It would be better to decrease the amount of gems to use for the premium choices or lower the amount of money that we can buy the gems for to 0.99 atleast. Maybe that way we don't have to worry as much for the choices we have to make in the story, for one not having enough gems or two the premium choices asking for too much gems from us. Plus most of the time not having enough gems can prevent us from choosing what we would like. I think every review on this app would appreciate if you could do something about the gems(rubies). Besides that, I'm in love with this beautiful story. I downloaded this game cuz I‚Äôm looking to play cute romance games and the guys are super cute and I liked the concept of it and I want to do Dylan‚Äôs route and the premium choices are expensive. I don‚Äôt like that and I don‚Äôt have money to buy gems. Not everyone who plays the game has a job and makes money but we are able to ask parents. But not every parent is gonna say yes to buy a few gems to waste them only on one premium choice. Okay, this game is AMAZING! The guys are cute, the grammar is great, and the story is so awesome! But the thing is the gems. Listen, we shouldn‚Äôt have to pay gems to get the good scenes with the boys. And if you‚Äôre going to do that, at least make a system so that every chapter we earn a gem at the end. Also, you prices for gems are ridiculous! Who wants to pay that much for such a small amount of gems? Like please get rid of the gem options! Other otome games don‚Äôt do this so please get rid of this feature. "

All the bosses have one-hits, high stun chances, or reflect full damage back?!!?!! Like what the point in DEF it does seem to do much and it doesn't help that the lowest stats you get in the beginning. LUK does double damage but it caps at 60 but it doesn't seem to do much. My problem is the lag of weapon choices at certain point (FLAME SWORD all day) and DEF just doesn't seem to protect as much. LvL up isn't that rewarding less these ( +1 AllStats, +Match2, +Match3, +MaxHp) and these are in order of best to least. Individual Stats are ( +DEF, +ATK). LUK doesn't even matter but to easily assessable  so lvling that is waste of time.  At this point investing in high hp stack would be great to help avoid against being 1-shot. This game can be addicting if you enjoy games based on the luck of the draw. But what makes it even more addicting is the customizations you come across like various weapons and enchanted items that can give you an advantage.You can also go to the bar and spend your hard earned gold for the chance toincrease your total hp and luck which is invaluable in the later and harder levels you'll unlock.Yes, its simple and mindless, but its extremely entertaining if you're in the mood for a casual dungeon romp. This has been an all time favorite of mine for years. Tl:dr few good hours of gameplay, pleasant to look at, not too hard to avoid dying but if you die you start over, simple gameplay doesn‚Äôt take away from experience. Would recommend.This game is enjoyable to play although the gameplay is simple and only involves letting a slot wheel spin the lack of ads and retro design style make it better than almost all other games I‚Äôve tried. According to other people it seems once you progress far the difficulty curve becomes too steep I‚Äôve played for about three hours and haven‚Äôt found any issues yet. My only problem is that if you die once you restart but I didn‚Äôt find that to be a huge issue. "

You have survival and creative mode, different creatures, different blocks, weapons, items, blueprints, and miniature blocks where you build inside a perimeter of whatever you want and it will become a 1 by 1 block of what you built which is handy for decorating. You can even create the model of a creature or weapon and give it special effect in the plugin library. There is multiplayer and downloadable maps as well. There‚Äôs even a plant which you can water every day and collect it‚Äôs fruit for loot and unlock the crafting recipe for a new item. There‚Äôs daily login reward, events, skins, drawings, and so much more. However, there is only 1 major problem that I have which is with the machines. There are many different machines but the rotator the one that seems to be glitched out the most. I tried putting all sorts of possible things to give it power for it to turn but it just wouldn‚Äôt move. So, I tried it in a different world and it turned like it was suppose to. But besides that, the game is really good. This game is really great and I really enjoy everything about it. There is so many things you can do, however there is a feature that should be added to multiplayer rooms, when you enter a room the host has the ability to remove you from the room and they don‚Äôt even need a reason, so I would like it if the host of the room has to have a reason to ban someone because I play in multiplayer rooms a lot and sometimes I get banned right away ( I‚Äôm thinking that some people do it because they want people that speak their language) and I think that is ok because maybe they want to make more friends and it would be easier if they speak their native language but sometimes it is ridiculous when someone bans someone from the room for a really silly reason for example the owner is really mean and is killing everyone in game and then they ban the people who run or try to fight back. So I would like it if they had to select a reason to ban someone like maybe cheating or anything reasonable at all not just because they want to. I love this game but it never loads it never does and when characters are talking most of the people playing are different languages like this game needs to be abled to translate almost everything because people in different countries speak different language and when they talk in chat you won‚Äôt know what there saying and it never loads the diy skin the stuff for it never loads and I think there should at least be a way to get more free stuff because most people can pay a lot so I say more clothing and fix the loading for mobile and iPhones and also translate for chat but the translate. also I think you should make a option to add a skin color and allow creative and survival in the same thing. Also please make the game free on pc because some people don‚Äôt have money it‚Äôs really hard especially when your a kid and make some skins for free it‚Äôs not really fair that you have to buy coins to get them but on the other hand it‚Äôs a very amazing game. Thanks for lisoning if you got this. "

The rewards are awesome but I found out that I cant get any of the rewards unless I‚Äôm actually in the same level of when I can get the reward, also I hate the fact that I can‚Äôt get a specific summon, I also cant get the summon anywhere. I didn‚Äôt even know how to play at first so it was all coming to me too fast as well. So whatever you guys do don‚Äôt use everything you receive all at once. üòû I kept dying a lot...overall its a great game to interact world chat etc. You can roam around freely in the game and see other players and fight them in the arena. To me it was hard to get every piece of information of how to actually play the game, you know specific small details such as the beginner questüòÖüòÇ ps. Letter which btw I did not read or even see cuz you know while your playing the game you don‚Äôt necessarily check everything especially because they have so much written content on almost everything. I recommend this game for players who like online gaming for mobile. I absolutely love the game and the story I love a game with a good story I love everything about the game but two thing the level requirement to  continue the story and how hard it is to level up. Its just so hard to level up its impossible to even level up just once I don‚Äôt even level up once when doing daily tasks and I do all the tasks with EXP given. Daily tasks are supposed to help level you up to meet that level requirement to continue the main story and it just doesn‚Äôt work I really don‚Äôt think the level requirement is necessary because what‚Äôs the point of it when players and not just me but many others can‚Äôt get to that level requirement. If this issue keeps going on people are gonna get uninterested in the game and aggravated with the hassle with leveling up and this level requirement to continue to he story and uninstall the app and stop playing all together. I have a idea maybe to improve the leveling up issue maybe you can Boost the EXP given in the daily tasks because the EXP in the daily tasks is no where close to the EXP Given when you are doing the main story quests it‚Äôs a real big difference between the two and if you can‚Äôt do that then I think you should remove this level requirement thing to continue the story I hope you guys really think about the problem cause I and surely many of other people really love the game and don‚Äôt want it to fail. Thank you for your feedback! We will take your suggestion and will ensure to implement more feature that engage coordination with other players as well as more more events that will help player increase their EXP gaining.Hope you enjoy the game and leave us a better rating.

But BEWARE, the controls can be quite irritating depending on the type of gamer you can be; if you‚Äôre impatient and like to be speedy tapping left or right of the screen proves to be quite trivial, but if your‚Äôe patient and slow I doubt you‚Äôll notice this as a problem. The puzzles are fair and are similar on the level of the original game‚Äôs difficulty of puzzle-solving, though near the end of the game some of the puzzles can be quite dubious which personally led to some frustrating moments, (specifically something involving a piano and 5 portraits). In terms of the canonicity, without spoiling much, this seems to be completely separate from the main game. While it helps to be familiar with Tarsier‚Äôs world of Little Nightmares, there‚Äôs no need to HAVE to play the prior title to enjoy this one (though it‚Äôs HIGHLY recommended that you do)...For actual fans, I think the game does a good job at supplementing some new theories. All in all, the game works well, the environments are well done, and as a fan of the first game you should definitely check this title out. Very little nightmares is a good game with a few flaws. First off the sound track is really good, the art style is loyal to the first little nightmares, and for a mobile game it is a very fun experience.The flaws keep it from being perfect tho. First off I witnessed some game breaking up bugs like in the second to last level wouldn‚Äôt allow me to move no matter where I tapped causing me to die, ‚ÄúThis happened a few times‚Äù. And some enemies you weren‚Äôt supposed to interact with would be stuck in place and you could walk on top of them. SPOILER WARNING:At the end of the game it‚Äôs revealed that you were not playing as six but as someone else. The reason I bring this up is because I have a personal complaint, I wanted to see how six got on to the maw and where she came from, while we do see a little of that, it‚Äôs very vague. And the story adds more questions than answers like how do the kids get to nest, and who are these new enemies you fight and why are they doing the things they are doing. But over all it was a fun experience and it is worth the money. So little nightmares is one of my favorite games on the planet. I‚Äôve played both the original and the DLCs and I love them. I think this game is a great addition to the series and I like that it can be played on mobile. I love this game but it is a bit glitchy. My main problem is crashing.  Every now and then the game would freeze and then crash. Then when I reloaded it, I would be started back a  level or two. But then the main problem is that when I got to the end of the trash level and I was climbing up the ladder, the game froze and crashed but i tried to start it up again, every time I pressed play it would just crash again so I couldn‚Äôt play the game. I tried deleting things off my phone but it didn‚Äôt help. I ended up having to restart the ENTIRE GAME. That was really annoying, but other than that I love this game and I would enjoy any others made, just please fix the bugs. "

My hubby and I have played just about every adventure game there is and this one was absolutely amazing!!!!!

All I can say for the bad reviews is that they just need to give it another chance because this game is FANTASTIC The bad reviews are unfair since they're in regards to an old glitch that was corrected. The game itself is a nice long length, fun puzzles, good storyline, and fun HOGs. I'm not a fan of HOGs in the first place...but this game made them bearable by using different styles (find pairs, place items into scene, etc). For context...I used to play every BF game that came out. But apparently, people complained about having to walk around too much in the game....so all BF games now find and solve inter-actives within the same scene. And half of any game is filled with HOGs. No brain or logic required. Just tappity-tap-taps. They lost a lot of gamers because of this. This game isn't difficult. And not a lot of walking or extended thought process required. But still better than all the developers that contribute to Bf games nowadays. And it was half price of BF games too. So that's a plus. "

This story has so much promise and so many pieces left unfinished. With the ultimate climax yet reached, it‚Äôs a shame that this intriguing story is still unfinished. Choice of Vampire is in my opinion a wonderful thought that isn't executed effectively. The problems with this story is that it's too linear. Another annoying feature is that it forces you to partake in its confusing politics which introduces too many characters in such a short time. Lastly, a few people will be confused if they have similar play troughs, but I've found hat certain stats somewhat matter and will bring about an event you didn't chose. However, these actions feel weird and out of place. If you want to continue the first book, I say purchase it, but don't expect it to be too good. Both of the games were great, but I am to this day hoping you guys will make a third one, fourth one, and maybe even a fifth and sixth one? The game is very interesting to me and it would be a great experience to see how you guys would write a story as the timeline progressed and with it our characters strength and status. There are a lot of ""it would be's"" but really I hope you guys make at least a third game. Cheers! "

They are good attempts at translating it, but you really need to find someone over here to proofread what you have written. (Everything that has to do with an investigation has to be precise, or localized diction.) I agree with your other top reviewer that the entire switching over to another screen when you make a mistake is too much, but I suspect that is to help populate your ads. That is possibly not necessary, and seems to people - like me, who work on Networking Equipment\Software - ‚Äúmay‚Äù be hacking into their device. I believe you are ‚ÄúNot Hacking‚Äù and safe to use for now, but believe that you should change that. You don‚Äôt need to add another screen in your app to run a 3rd screen. Whoever programmed this for you needs to fix that. I believe you did a ‚ÄúGREAT JOB‚Äù with this, and am looking forward to a ‚ÄúMore Elaborate Version‚Äù in the future. Thank you for making this App. ****Update**** Mystery shorts is made by the same company and has the exact same questions but not nearly as many ads. I deleted this game after they tried to FORCE me to give 5 stars for a hint. No. You do not earn 5 starts from me. It‚Äôs a one star game period. Too many ads. Too many grammatical and spelling errors. Some of the questions and answers don‚Äôt make sense. For example, in the fourth mystery a man snatched a woman‚Äôs purse. The woman is in the right side of the street looking towards the car which is driving in the right side of the road. It gives you two vehicles to choose from to decide which car was the vehicle that stole from the woman. The car on the left has the steering wheel on the left side and the car on the right has the steering wheel on the right side. The car is driving down the street on the right side so you would think the correct car that stole her purse would have the steering wheel on the left but no. The correct answer was the car that has the steering wheel on the right side. It says the steering wheel would have to be on the right in order to snatch the purse from the woman since the woman was also on the right which does make sense but it also doesn‚Äôt. First of all, they don‚Äôt say that it was a drive by purse snatching. For all we know the man could‚Äôve been on foot, stole her purse, and then hopped into a car and rode away. It kind of ruins the game when there are tricks like this. If there weren‚Äôt so many Ads. I‚Äôve been on a crime kick lately and when I saw this app advertised I wanted to give it a try because who doesn‚Äôt want to try and be a detective solving crimes? BUT it is EXTREMELY frustrating when there is an Ad popping up almost every five seconds, and some of them you end up accidentally clicking on, without even realizing it, and taking you out of the Pocket Mystery app to download the advertised app. It almost takes out all of the fun of solving the crime puzzles. And I get that I can pay ‚Äúx‚Äù amount of dollars to remove the ads, but let‚Äôs be honest, who actually pays to remove ads? Ads pay for the app. I don‚Äôt mind banner ads at the bottom of the screen, I don‚Äôt even mind ads popping up before and after each solved case puzzle, but ads popping up after ALMOST EVERY right or wrong guess for four questions is a bit ridiculous. Not only is it super annoying, it also throws you off trying to solve each case because instead of remembering parts of the case you already answered correctly or other bits of information, you‚Äôre completely bombarded and distracted by the ads causing you to forget the information at hand.Other than that, the game is enjoyable and addictive, and I‚Äôm already halfway through all of the stages.

I have already finished all the other characters available as well as every character in the Japanese version (I am able to read it so it‚Äôs easier for me] Though it may be that I know what happens to the MC and the characters I still wanna see the characters in the English! Overall the game is good, it takes a bit of time to grind for money if you don‚Äôt wanna pay for coins though, but still possible to get the amount in a certain amount of time! I also wish that you make more games! They are amazing, great quality, and have good characters! I have played all other ones up till now and they‚Äôre all 6‚Äôstar high ranking, in my opinion, and I hope that this isn‚Äôt the last game because I am already excited to see the next game if there ever will be one! So this game is truly amazing and the romance is incredibly written but one of the characters, who should be the Joan of Arc is changed into a male, now named Jean. This is so highly problematic I can‚Äôt even explain so shortly. Joan of Arc was a real woman and her entire life story and significance had a major impact on women everywhere, it is essential that she always is interpreted as a woman. Her struggles were one only women could face and her successes belong to women, not to be washed up as a man. If there‚Äôs anything her life story has taught us- is to GIVE CREDIT TO WOMEN. The change of her gender is not only offensive- it is highly sexist and tone-deaf. She did not die her death only to be later dishonored and even stripped of her gender. I get it that this game is trying to appeal to straight female audiences but why not just use another male historical figure instead of changing a famous female historical figure? This is very wrong. If you really want Joan of Arc, keep her gender and write it as a wlw storyline. A real romance writer will know how to work with that, and if you can‚Äôt write wlw or anything lgbtq related- then just don‚Äôt write romance at all. Again, the game is written beautifully but PLEASE diversify it. Allow the MC to be available in all races, and allow routes for different genders. I love the story and the graphics and sound effects are really well done! I wish there were a way to just pay a flat rate for the stories, because it seems unnecessary to have a social/battle aspect to this game. All in all, I would recommend this with a little patience because it does seems to be a great story so far. Unfortunately, chapters are very short and it‚Äôs costly to try and progress if you consider paying to move forward. I‚Äôve paid for other games before, but I‚Äôd say this is more costly than others compared to the length of the content that you get. For the free options, you can watch ads to get diamonds, but you only get 1 diamond per ad and there‚Äôs a limit on the ads. It‚Äôs disproportionately difficult to use this method to get free diamonds when I don‚Äôt believe there are any paid options below 100 diamonds. They also unfortunately use TapJoy which is glitchy at best and scammy at worst. I‚Äôve never seen TapJoy work correctly in other games that I‚Äôve seen that have it integrated. TapJoy is one of those companies that gives you diamonds in exchange for completing an action or purchasing something. It‚Äôs great IN THEORY, but I have never heard of it it working properly and it‚Äôs unfortunate that it‚Äôs linked with this game. "

It‚Äôs a long, powerful, gripping journey where moral questions I never considered gripped me. I haven‚Äôt felt so attached to characters in a long time and the length of the story let the grow so well and become powerful and striking people. The story is nothing short of astounding. A tale and a concept I have never seen done and it was done so well that it was made to feel familiar in its approach. The ideas and the universe are so novel and new and exciting that it can seem overwhelming considering them but the story explains and paces it so well that it feels organic, smooth and almost caring. It doesn‚Äôt hold your hand but it doesn‚Äôt leave you high and dry in jargon or theory.What I found the most important and for me powerful element is that the story, centered around one relatively inconsequential question creates the entire plot, an entire discourse on ethics, morality, power and even life and asks some powerful question in the story and then answers them. Or better yet let‚Äôs you answer it yourself. It is truly hard to describe the elation I had at this story and just how much it moves me without spoiling it so I will wrap up here with this. I laughed and cried with the characters. I walked and ran with them and I danced and wondered with them. I was there and that is not something I can say about a lot of stories. Oh this is such a fun game! And I loved every character they were all sweet and 3 dimensional. They really do make you want to save everyone, especially Loren, such a sweetheart. The story was great as well, by the end, I felt like I‚Äôd just starred in my own gothic romantic adventure. I got the friendship ending where I saved everyone but didn‚Äôt date and I feel like my heart grew three sizes, it was so heartwarming. If I did have any feedback though, I would love the option to be of another race. Being non-white, it felt a little odd to be compared to Dev and Bastian as if I were white(such as the scene where you have to chose whether to go to town or send Dev, and it says something like ‚Äúthey might not take to well to him bc of his skin‚Äù. I remember bc I thought ‚Äúüò¨ well they‚Äôd hate me then‚Äù lol). Speaking of, I really appreciated the attention put into identities in this game, in race, sexuality, and gender identity (there was even a poly option???). It was put in seamlessly, but it still felt like they weren‚Äôt just cosmetic identities. I loved it. Games should really follow this game‚Äôs example when it comes to diversity. This story was beautiful and I was attached to all of the characters by the end. You can tell how much care and craft went into it. I am so attached to the characters I would even love to play a sequel! I really felt their pain and was so worried when I thought they‚Äôd get hurt. I also enjoyed the diversity and especially Loren being nonbinary and the option to be trans. It felt a little bit unrealistic (it would have been great if there was binding in the story etc but it‚Äôs not necessary) but the story was fantasy so it was not difficult to suspend disbelief. The one complaint I have is that the romance all seemed very hurried. I wasn‚Äôt sure who to choose that quickly and was unsure if denying their advances at first would make them no longer romance-able. It was also frustrating because the choices all seemed to happen at very inconvenient times and so I would put off showing interest in them until a more convenient time but then they‚Äôd no longer be available. Spoilers: I was actually very sad when Dev and Loren got together. I love them both so much and I‚Äôm glad they found each other but I would loved to have been able to romance them both (that may have been an option but it wasn‚Äôt in my ending) or at least be able to choose one of them later in the story. Regardless, I‚Äôm so thankful I was able to get them their happy ending. "

Please fix this I love playing this game with my best friend but when I getting ripped up by people that aren‚Äôt actually skilled and they pay to win I get so angry because you can‚Äôt do anything about it. Thank you for your kind words and critics as well. We will improve our matchmaking so that not paying users don't feel that bad about the game. If you have screenshots of unbalanced match and rating, win rate % information, please let us know, this will help improving. support@panzerdog.com I urge devs to read this because I‚Äôll be including ideas for next update. I really enjoy this game and play with my brother every so often. I do have problems with it such as the unbalanced part when playing with guys who spent money on the game but I understand it‚Äôs pay to win. I would like to see some new maps such as the ‚ÄúDo not‚Äù map seen in images and the one with the choppers. New vehicles such as choppers added to much larger maps if the game could run it would be great. Attachments and different time set maps would be cool such as  night maps where flashlights are good. Seeing a PvE mode like zombies or even a coop story mode would be interesting. (I want to point out I don‚Äôt expect any of these to come out soon or ever but would throughly enjoy them in the future). I enjoy the new game mode you added but I barely get that one chosen. Maybe adding a select game mode option would be nice after more are implemented. Add a repair tool or wrench to fix destroyed cars. I noticed that when someone leaves the game, an A.I. Continues to play for you or the other person which allows for unbalanced matches which is bad. Either remove the person entirely or don‚Äôt allow leaving. Allow vehicles to survive longer but make the occupants weaker while in said vehicle. But most importantly, keep doing what you guys are doing because you have created a really good game that is so addicting that even when you lose you want to play again just to feel better. Ill start off by saying that I love this game. It‚Äôs action packed and has some interesting mechanics. My only complaint is being able to acquire coins in a decent amount of time is near impossible without spending hours playing daily or just spending real money. Some weapons you can earn coins per kill but I think that should be a feature with every gun, just more coins per kill for the more premium and higher tier weapons. We should at least get coins for winning instead of hoping for the random bonus spin which gives you a negligible amount of coins and none of the gold coins or doing ‚Äúgoals‚Äù that pay 30 coins. There should be a base bonus for winning in each rank. Realistically I can only spend my coins upgrading one weapon to even compete at my rank. Or I have to purposely lose A LOT of matches to get people of similar skill and weapon tier. That also makes some of the missions insanely hard to complete. Even if its just 100 coins per win and 5-20 coins per kill depending on weapon MK lvl I‚Äôd play more than once a week. Again great game, its just hard to stay interested when it‚Äôs so time consuming to save up for just one weapon upgrade that gives mild improvements for us broke people not willing to pay to win.

Not a lot of ads, and the ads you do choose to watch, actually accumulate and give bonuses after so many videos. I actually look forward to watching ads in this game as watching enough give me permanent buffs!Keep it up! This game is fun. However it does take a bit of time because its not fast paced. You can play without paying a cent unless you want to. Ads are low there isn‚Äôt a lot. You can easily pick the game up and put the game down.My only complaint is the location map is too small. I wish there was a way to tap it to enlarge it. I really can‚Äôt see where he is digging.Update The map I am talking about is found in the upper right of the screen where it shows how far you have dug. It would really be cooler if after tapping that it was a bit larger. For the longest time I thought I wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere. I was about to delete the game but hung in there till I finally could see that I HAD actually gotten lower. This game is a fun way to pass the time.... and I mean a LOT of time considering how hard it is to put the game down. My only suggestion is for the game devs to consider making the ‚ÄúBuy x1, Buy x10, etc‚Äù stay to the option that I had last chosen it for. What I mean by this is for the option I have chosen previously (for example ‚ÄúBuy MAX‚Äù) to stay the chosen option unless I change it myself. I prefer ‚ÄúBuy MAX‚Äù and I have to always change it to this every time I open the game up or trigger the Big Bang. It‚Äôs not the end of the world, but it does become aggravating and tedious. For this, I took 2 stars away. "

I already have five stars on all of the scenes and there is still over 11 hours left on the time based evidence. Longer times for later cases makes more sense because then you can go back and work on stars for the old ones but for the first one, I am now stuck with nothing to do but wait. I really like it‚Äôs back in it‚Äôs og format, Travel In Time‚Äôs was ok but with the new update for 60 seconds to find everything, but it‚Äôs still stressful to find everything in time, it feels like ‚Äútime attack‚Äù 2.0.

I really want the menu theme red and pink for City of Romance‚Äôs stand-alone app. This is the Best Criminal Case because you don‚Äôt have to waste a lot of coins unlike the Travel in Time you do but I think this is way cooler because it‚Äôs like playing a Halloween Criminal Case!

‚ÄéEndless Depths 2 RPG,"Endless Depths 2 is a rogue-like role-playing game that holds true to classic features such a randomly generated dungeon levels, a myriad of class/race combinations, a bunch of treasure to discover and a one-life-one-death difficulty level that can be quite addicting. In addition to what might be expected in a rogue-like RPG, Endless Depths 2 adds a level of persistence to the genre that allows for item farming, crafting, and even increased difficulty levels should a character make it to the end. Endless Depths 2 is a sequel to the popular Endless Depths and Endless Nights RPGs available in the app store.   It uses the TitanFire RPG system, which focuses on building a strategic defensive combat system.   This class-based game encourages a mixing and matching of classes, including special classes that can be unlocked as the character progresses.   Endless Depths 2 Features: * Classic rogue-like game play and turn-based strategy * Farm gold and gems that carry over from one character to the next * Craft items from the gold you've acquired (even gold gained from previous characters) * Start with 4 basic classes (Warrior, Adventurer, Cleric, Mage) and discover over 20 new classes as you progress * Start as 6 basic races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-Ogre) each with their own unique ability * The game starts over with increased difficulty should you defeat Mephistopheles Endless Depths 2 is similar to RPG classics like Rogue,  Angband and Diablo with a level of challenge similar to Dark Souls.  You can find online help for the game at http://www.nations-software.info/endless-depths-help or by clicking ""Online Help"" from within the game.  ***All new to the Endless series*** See the nuts and bolts as the status will display your dice roll and any bonuses compared to your enemy's dice roll and bonuses.

Handles great but looks like my childhood games. One of the worst things about randomly generated environments is that they often look totally fake and out of place.  Endless Depths 2 does great placing pseudorandom elements like hallway statues and fountains and altars to make dungeons memorable.  Great ""as you fight, so shall you level"" character development too.  Try a true retro RPG.  Take it from someone who was there! This is an incredible game, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs fun and addictive and well crafted. But recently I‚Äôve run into creatures with 75% poison and magic resistance, weakness to light, and 100% resistance to literally everything else, including physical attacks. This is one case where I believe the game to be unbalanced, because playing a melee character means almost certain death when faced with one of these, especially since almost all monsters follow you RIGHT up your bum with almost no way to get away from them. We don‚Äôt need incredibly fast monsters that are 100% invincible unless you have very specific abilities. Instant fan. This is super addictive and well thought out. Only criticism is the lack of music or even some environmental ambience would be nice. Other than that this is down right solid and a lot of fun to play! "

Slow Katz: you just talk to captain kallio skipping everything as fast as you could and just go out and see the snowstorm and somehow  just randomly the game just gets slow right after something fast.  2.floating Katz: I have no idea about how this glitch happened but somehow in return to the swamp, the cat just sinks into the ground when on the ground but when you press left or right fast enough, the cat just floats. Even if you change the cat you still float. 3. Freezing Katz: just so you know, the ‚Äò‚Äôfreezing‚Äô‚Äô meant like the game soft locked. I know how to do this glitch!!! In Kaze towers, when you go to the door that leads to the place where there is this someone who gives the key to the sky labyrinth, okay, so you just go there, look at the door, equip the balloon item, float, and when the balloon pops, hold left until you land and the game. just. soft locks. I downloaded the game on the AppStore and to undo the glitches, just restart the app (don‚Äôt delete it)!Fun fact:Did you know that in the super cat tales timeline, Super cat tales 2 is actually before the first? Watch the video ‚Äúsuper cat tales timeline‚Äù for more info. Please just go with Shriyans instead of Shriyansp8. A lot of love went into this game and you can tell. The story actually has some dept for a side scrolling mobile game. Though this game does have some caveats for any non gamers looking for a game similar to Mario or Kirby. 1. Coin grinding. Unless you're willing to spend $10, collecting the right amount of coins is going to feel like a chore. You‚Äôd have to repeatedly replay a specific level more than 50 times to grind for coins to proceed in the game. Personally I think this creator is worth the $10 but if you can‚Äôt pay then prepare for repeating 2-4.2. YOU ARE GOING DIE over and over and over again. Not going to lie, this game is going to be frustrating because sheer amount of death you‚Äôll experience. Some deaths are permanent, some are due to monkeys, and some are due to impatience. You‚Äôd either have to be patient or play better, you‚Äôre stilling going to die a bunch though.3. Platforming in the later stages becomes unnecessarily difficult. If you want to beat the game, you gotta work on your platforming during this game. You don‚Äôt get punished in early stages but once you get to world 7.. oof TLDR: It‚Äôs not all sunshine and rainbows in this cute kitty cat game. Be prepared for fun, rage, tears, and lots of death. Seriously.. you‚Äôll die.. a lot.. I don‚Äôt usually write reviews but when I played this game, I knew I had to. I love how you can switch cats on the fly, something cat tales 1 didn‚Äôt let you do. The mechanic is so overused yet in this game it seems so original. All cats play pretty distinctly and have their own abilities. When I first picked up the game I thought it was going to be simple, joystick controls. When I loaded the first level, and saw the controls which are very hard to describe other than weird, I thought of deleting the game. But after the third level I had gotten used to it and the controls were pretty easy to understand. This is a game with unusual controls but nevertheless is easy to control. I‚Äôve seen reviews with people saying the controls are broken, to them, I say try harder.The soundtrack astonished me at first because I‚Äôve never really played a mobile game with such a good soundtrack. So play this game for yourself and enjoy everything this game has to offer.

‚ÄéCard City Nights 2,"Journey through a mysterious flying city called Starship Frivolity where every inhabitant is obsessed with the latest space-craze, The Card Game! Battle them to win their trust - and their cards! - and progress through the dubious laboratories, haunted docks and lethal restaurants of this space station to find out its greatest mysteries. The Card Game (or TCG for short, the only card game they play in space) is played by two players on a single board. Connect your cards to give them power, and when they're all fired up they deal damage, heal, shield, or mess with your opponents cards. Since they stay on the board after they've been activated, you can keep combos alive indefinitely by stringing new cards into the chain. Playing on the same board gives you opportunity to further mess with you opponents, blocking their moves or stealing their power! With a renewed gameplay system, an all new adventure and online multiplayer, Card City Nights 2 improves on its predecessor in every way. * Adventure and Cards, together again! * Online multiplayer * 200 unique cards with characters from the Ludosity universe * Discover increasingly more unlikely locations * Still no IAP whatsoever",https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/1a/05/38/1a0538b6-b9c4-09ec-cf4e-26f30e995a03/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-0-8.png/1200x630wa.png,It's always night in space,3.9 ‚Ä¢ 22 Ratings,$4.99,,"October 1, 2018","This card game is fun to play, is hilarious, and has great mechanics.  Like all this dev‚Äôs games, originality and style are everywhere.  Ironic for a game that utilizes characters and art from their previous games. lolHowever crashes do seem to be a problem. The most egregious of these are while playing the arcade Buni minigame.  I was getting the hang of it and enjoying it, but it crashed several times trying to get past the third(?) stage.   Thanks for the game and the fixes! Fairly fun to learn card game but only a select few cards are usable and hardly any different variety to build a deck with that‚Äôs viable. If you farmed currency and collected all the cards from the 3 different packs along with finding the few hidden cards and hacker cards, don‚Äôt expect more packs from the second half of the game. In a way, Card City Nights 2 feels unfinished and I would not recommend this over the many other card games out on the app store. I was expecting more cards to choose from but was very disappointed when I wasn‚Äôt given any new cards after the first half of the game and then suddenly beating the game. I loved Card City Nights for its simple but deep gameplay, witty dialogue, and lovely aesthetics, and was initially worried when CCN2 opted to switch out the core gameplay so significantly. I needn‚Äôt have worried, though! CCN2 is a lovely game with a great backbone of a simple-to-learn card game with a surprising amount of nuance. Ludosity are masters of characters and music as usual, combined with a legitimately addicting card game across a silly little story on a radical spaceship. Play this game! "

I love it.... for too many reasons to even list (but I will try).... First, the game itself is fun, addictive, colorful, full of surprises and all around entertaining!! You get plenty of options and opportunities to earn all the coins and energy that you need to continue playing. Even though I‚Äôve only been playing for a short time, it seems there are a lot of extra little challenges as well (for like holidays, etc..) where you earn great prizes!! There are SO MANY different decorative items to jazz up your island however you like!! And one of the VERY TOP of my favorite things about this game is the adds that you have to watch.... THERE ARE NONE!! So far I have not been forced to watch a single add in order to continue playing!! The only time an add has been presented to me, I was not required to view it. I am given the option to watch an add in order to receive a reward!!!! THAT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!! Most free apps/games out there force you to watch adds in order to keep playing and many FORCE you to watch adds constantly which I‚Äôm sure we all hate!! To sum it up.... I obviously love this game and the way it is set up. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone, young or old, male or female!! I can‚Äôt wait to see what else is in store for me as I move through the levels.... gotta go.... I must play!!!! üòÅLisa Hi Lisa, A big thank you from everyone on the team for your feedback. We appreciate you taking the time to let us know what you think. You gave everyone on the team a big smile.Happy adventuring!The Wooga Support team I have been playing this game for quite awhile and I love it. But the last week or so I have started to stall. I have all the upgradable housing, and it cost so much to open the next scene that I can‚Äôt keep up. I have had to spend all of my Gems to speed up buildings because it takes so long for the higher flowered items to build. So I either have to buy a bunch of cheaper decorations that I don‚Äôt want because I have more than I want now or spend many days replaying the same scenes. (I have spent real money in the game - not a tone, but a bit and even with that, I am stalled. Part of this is because of the stay at home orders, I have had more time to play - with that in mind, I hope the developers will be adding more upgradable buildings (these really help with not getting board waiting to build up coin to buy decorations and then waiting for them to build- which can take 4-5 days to do that- all while having to replay the same scenes over and over) especially since the garden items that are possible with 5-star boxes seem to be feast or famine - my husband has received 4 frog fountains and 3 light posts from boxes, while I have only been able to get 2 frogs and 1 light (and I play way more and am about double his level) I know it‚Äôs random chance, but it does get frustrating at times. Hi there,Thank you for your feedback. We are always pleased to receive both positive and negative feedback, and suggestions from our players. We would like to thank you for taking the time to write to us and let us know how we can improve. Kind Regards,Your Wooga Team First, if you are going to send us surveys, let us comment on things vs just being able to select a predetermined option. I do like this game a lot however there could be some improvements!One- it is way too difficult and time consuming to earn purple diamonds; as you need them to expand island. Yes it helps when you can start gifting however you are depending on other people to return the favor and should not be capped at 6. The team idea was great and it is fun however when only 3-4 (of 15) only play it‚Äôs no longer fun as you cannot win or come close therefore why bother. Why waste all your coins if if gets you barely anything. You are better off playing your own island. Plus the team events are way to costly; 12 coins won‚Äôt even allow you to finish 1 set so again why bother. It is extremely rare you would have 300 coins to play so something different needs to happen here. Same thing with serving drinks; it‚Äôs only your group and again if only 3-4 people participate it makes the whole experience a negative instead of being fun like it should be. This goes with the purple diamonds and for those past 400 level..where are the other islands??  You run out of room way to quickly and can not gain more room quick enough so you are stuck. You can‚Äôt purchase an item as you don‚Äôt have room, so you can‚Äôt get flowers to move on, and so on and so on. Speaking of too much time- it takes WAY too long to renovate the lighthouse, church, etc. Hi there,Thank you for your feedback.

This is old school all the way - even fown to the single developer working alone, just like those Atari 800 games I loved in the 1980s.The gameplay is simple (which I love), the goals are clear, the music is GREAT, and the graphics - perfect!  I don't like ultra-real 3D scenery except in racing games.  Loved the goatee on my character too.  I am happy with graphics just like these.  Loads of similarities to the original Wizardry (the ""stables - free!"" Was a giveaway), which again is a great thing.  I wish we had the original Wiz for iPhone...The price is very reasonable, I appreciate the developer's efforts (I read the credits, Jon!) and am going to enjoy finishing this little gem. Hi, Catman! Thanks for the review! You're exactly right: That very first Wizardry game for the PC all the way back in the '80s was a big formative influence on me, and it was fun to get to pay homage to it in Vigil RPG. :-) One of my absolute favorites. The graphics are budget, & the adventure is on the short side, but this is one of the most advanced & innovative games around. It's the RPG equivalent of an old school hot rod: strip away all the excess weight, supercharge the engine, then tune & balance it all to  perfection. The ""engine"" in this case is the combat system, and it's a nitro burning beast. I wholeheartedly recommend Vigil to anyone considering it, and I sincerely hope that AggroMagnet brings more games like this to market. Hey Discostallion, thanks for the super kind words! You pretty much nailed exactly what I was going for when I decided to make Vigil RPG: A fun and engaging combat system -- which is, after all, the bulk of what you spend your time doing when you play any RPG -- and just enough decent graphics, sound, and story around all of that to make it work. There's no sequel in the works as of right now, but if I once again get the itch to play a certain type of game that I can't find on the App Store -- as I did when I wanted to play a game like Vigil RPG, couldn't find one, and decided to make it myself! -- your kind words about enjoying Vigil RPG will be a big motivating factor! Thank you! I purchased this app after reading your interview on making a one-man game. Thanks for putting so much awesome info in the credits/acknowledgements. It is definitely challenging but also a lot of fun to play! I'll definitely buy your next game! Hey, MikeTMorpheus! I'm glad you liked reading the interview I did with TouchArcade; it was my first time doing something like that! As a solo developer, I did take advantage of many graphics and music assets that other folks had kindly posted online under Creative Commons and similar licenses, and I definitely wanted to make sure each and every one of those folks got credit for the cool stuff they had created!

Or there like every 30min but this is ever 5 seconds. So if you ok with ad‚Äôs every 5 seconds to 2 mins then this is perfect. If not, this game is really fun you should still try it but beware of AD‚Äôs. This may seem like a funny game but its actually stolen content. Just from looking at the the title screen I that this is just a stolen game. The audio is also all glitched out too. I haven‚Äôt played the Original Escaping the prison but watching people play it, it never did that. Please don‚Äôt play this game. Its just a copy. This guy also didn‚Äôt seem to credit Puffballs United anywhere I looker, although I may just be wrong on that part. I don‚Äôt mean in the game itself. I mean in the app description. Like I said, This guy just copied the entire game and was too lazy to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything like glitches or the game crediting Puffballs. Please don‚Äôt download this app. Its a cashgrab. "

Overall, this is the kind of experience that makes mobile gamers feel validated and like we don't need consoles.  We need more games like Oceanhorn and this.  Also, don't hate Picomy for needing to break away from Sega and list this game separately. It can be very hard to satisfy the demands of a mega company.

My only (minor) gripe is the scrolling through the item lists could be more responsive. Not a whole lot to this app. It gives information great to have at your fingertips while playing the game. Item descriptions and some great information upgrading weapons. How the upgrade process works, the math behind each upgrade and the locations of items needed to make the upgrades. Even though there isn't a ton of information in the app what is there is definitely worth the money. Make the purchase. This app to start off, is phenomenal and very ambitious.

I am a huge fan of the developers and have all of their other games. The reason why I refrained from giving 5 stars is because of the price. I‚Äôm not opposed to purchasing a game, but if I do, I expect it to come with all the usual game features. In previous games by the developer, you could fast travel and get hints without purchasing them. In this new game, you have to pay additional fees to unlock fast travel and hints, on top of paying for the game. I was a bit bummed and deterred by this, but made it work without these features. Syntaxity,Since finally trying Blackthorn Castle last year, I was thoroughly impressed by the lack of glitches, smoothe gameplay with a functional and easy to use User Interface, explorative setting locations, challenging yet not too difficult to beat, quality graphics, realistic style, sound effects and music as well as the adventurous nature of these games.  One after the other, I tried each game and delightfully found the same satisfaction in all (current) six.Then, you released your bountiful update for the Lost Ship, which was originally much too short.  Now seeing the pattern of adding similar updates and extra content, in order of original release, I eagerly await more to be released.If I had to describe these games, in as few words, I would say they are honestly must-haves and instant buys for this genre.  If a new game were to be released, I would buy it as soon as I found out about it.  Having them all up to now is not enough because they are so satisfying.  But there's more.I discovered an interesting alternative to their replay value.  Sure once you play them you might get tired.  I liked Blackthorn so much I kept replaying it, but with an unexpected challenge I put to myself.  Memory.  I've repeatedly played them several times each as a way to stregthen my memorySo, I look forward to each new game/additional content Syntaxity releases.  To be honest, you couldn‚Äôt release add-on or new game content fast enough.Thank you. I‚Äôve been a longtime fan. Have played every game from this studio. With this newest installment the developers are charging an in app purchase in order to unlock fast travel!!!!!! A feature that has previously been free in past installments!!!!!  No fast traveling makes gameplay tedious but there is no way I‚Äôm paying an extra dollar for fast travel in a game that I‚Äôve already paid several dollars for. Hints are also behind a paywall, which doesn‚Äôt really affect me other than being annoyed that the company is squeezing you for every cent you‚Äôve got. I  won‚Äôt be buying from this developer studio again. A real shame because the titles up until this point have been entertaining. So unfortunate when a company is so greedy that they nickel and dime you for basic features when you‚Äôve already paid a purchase price for the app. Thank you for your feedback, it is very important to us that our customers enjoy our games.

It's all about watching and learning, and then skillfully pulling off attacks at the right moment‚Äù.  Defkalion was fishing at the quiet blue sea when he heard the voice of the Goddess Athena. ‚ÄúHurry up‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe isle of Issyos has been cursed by the Olympus!‚Äù And so, fearing for his daughter Delia, his only family left, the fisherman sails back to his home, where the adventure is about to begin. The Curse of Issyos is a retro-styled action platformer with nothing but the classics of an old 8-bit game: a good bunch of enemies and bosses, linear and open scroll levels, secrets to discover, and a background story inspired by Greek mythology. It doesn't try to mimic a retro system in particular, but it's coherent with its own limitations in the use of colors, sprites and chip sounds.  Features: ‚óè Compatible with MFi, XBox One and PS4 controllers. ‚óè Haptic vibration. ‚óè iCloud support. ‚óè Game Center achievements and leaderboards. ‚óè Play in landscape or portrait orientation. ‚óè Look and feel of a console game from 1987-1988. ‚óè Based on Greek Mythology. ‚óè 30+ soundtrack by Gryzor87. ‚óè 7 levels, 9 bosses and more than 40 unique enemies. ‚óè A secret level that can change the curse of the game. * Game texts in English only.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/6c/1b/05/6c1b05a7-70c5-9ad7-6c85-5ac3693e71b7/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-7-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,An epic greek adventure,4.4 ‚Ä¢ 27 Ratings,$2.99,,"September 18, 2020","I love that this is a retro ‚Äúpixel‚Äù game that ‚Äúplays by the rules‚Äù of actual 8-bit gaming: limited palette, pixels are all the same size, animations take place on a pixel grid, actual ‚Äúchiptune‚Äù soundtrack.

But sadly the game lacks in a lot of areas animation quality, balance, weapon variety, customization, map and game modes.Although graphics are surprisingly attractive the stiff and up smooth animations distract you from the beauty of the game. The weapons are horribly over powered killing opponents with one shot to the foot while the player can survive an onslaught of close quarter unrelenting fire. There are a few weapons in the game but the variety needs heavy expansion and proper class organization. Player and weapon customization should be player choice, if you going to include custom skins and attachments in the game let the player choose which skin and attachments to equip or choose to go full default. So far the game seem to have 3 maps all of which are chosen at random when you play the 1 multiplayer mode, more modes and maps are heavily needed like (Free for all, battle royals, capture the flag, gun game, domination, kill confirmed, search and destroy, etc) also the ability to choose which mode and map you want to play.It may look as though this game is bad, but actually it‚Äôs a very enjoyable fully offline time passer in its early state, but it has a lot to improve and build on. It‚Äôs very hard to come across good graphic offline FPS games that don‚Äôt require any sort of internet connection. The things mentioned above is to help change this game from being mostly graphics to being a well rounded and fun totally offline experience. So here‚Äôs to hoping the developers maximizes on this games potential. "

This question drives exploration of your empty house as you examine keepsakes and dig through boxes to find answers. Guided by the melancholy diary of your missing sister, you learn the house isn‚Äôt the only one keeping secrets. Immerse yourself in 1990s nostalgia and the intimate details of private lives in this impressive achievement of interactive storytelling. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to say I love this game so much because it was so addicting and such a good mystery there‚Äôs nothing chasing you and you can do it at your own speed but the problem with it is the first time I played I got glitched in the doorway but when I restarted it and I clicked new game I finish the game with in like two hours this game is amazing awesome and fun but I really want to find Sam you guys should make a second one that‚Äôs a tiny bit cheaper but is you actually are finding where Sam is I almost cried at the ending because it was so sad and so happy and I was so proud of myself too and I would pay for a new version but this game is definitely worth buying I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I was bored and downloaded this game not knowing anything about it. I saw pictures of a creepy, dim lit house and the mechanics of what looked like a puzzle game but I was very surprised when I realized I was basically playing a walking simulator story based game. I was disappointed in myself for not looking in to it before paying $5 but thought ok I‚Äôll play through it maybe the story will capture my interest. Now look, I‚Äôm all for equality and rights but the story, dialogue, and characters were all so beyond cringe to me it got me mad. Nobody in real life speaks like this, acts like this, thinks like this is what I kept saying to myself throughout the play through. There are no twists, no thrills and no fun in this game. The gameplay consists of walking around and reading notes scattered around the house and that‚Äôs it. So why not just make it a short story or film? I do not like games like this, Florence, and Old Man‚Äôs Journey where it is clearly meant to be a short story or video but they throw in some nonsense gameplay element in it.

The controls are simple but yet effective. The gameplay is good for beginners but you will need practice to be good. (Personally love that game design). The design of the graphically is AMAZING to say the least. It‚Äôs runs very smoothly (around 60-80 FPS witch is unheard of in mobile) the graphics and game art style is AMAZING. The character roster is really really great with characters for every different play style. And I love how that added a competitive mode with all of the characters unlocked and all moves unlocked. But Man I wish mobile would let us the skin of the character you own in competitive, like it would still be competitive but it would let me use my other big band costumes but only the skin not the stats, like an ult in smash bros or other fighting games or like in 2nd encore we‚Äôre they let you use a skin, and I want it because I want to show people cool looking characters and stuff but I don‚Äôt like playing free for all because not only people with characters that have the power level advantage would win 90% of the time, but the good thing is you can show off the cool characters. So if the game devs are reading this please add a feature we‚Äôre we can use the character costumes in competitive. This game is really really worth a download and playing and I‚Äôm only asking for one thing and that is to let us use our character costumes in competitive. Hey there,Thanks for the great review! Expanding the options and features of the online Versus mode is definitely something we want to do eventually. I can't give any specifics yet, but it's definitely on our radar! Best Regards,~HVS~ This game is absolutely great in every way possible. If you know you can handle it. It‚Äôs not for everyone. You need good hand eye coordination, and just being mature enough as you will enjoy the game even more. Getting premium credit is not difficult once you master how the system works a and how to properly use a good number of the 12 different fighters. I currently use Peacock, Squigly, Ms. Fortune and Beowulf really well now. Just playing a good amount that you get comfortable using combos and adapting makes it even more enjoyable. It will get slow after day not gonna lie but once I persevered and continued to keep players by I was rewarded with having lots of fun and getting excited to start getting silver tier and hopefully soon enough a gold tier. If you get stuck, you must remember as I don‚Äôt see too much help online,Don‚Äôt sell anything (yet)Upgrade Bronze even if you know there are silver and gold characters. (They are still good to have)Take risks that fit how well you play. I also love the comments some of these characters make after winning a match. I‚Äôm still laughing after the fact. Getting fully immersed in the story will be amazing for you. There are so many good things to say that you should just stop reading and play already. Thanks for this awesome btw, developers. Music is great, graphics is 200% on point, no glitching EVER and I‚Äôm happy to be playing! ü§©ü§Øü§óü§üüèªüëèüèªüëåüèª I downloaded this game a couple weeks ago and i‚Äôve been grinding a lot, almost every day, and I can‚Äôt seem to get enough of the game. I haven‚Äôt spent a cent but I can still get as far as everyone else by just playing. this game is hilarious, from intro/outro lines, but it even has JOJO REFERENCES. I could leave the review here from that last point alone but I have more praise for this game. I love the gameplay mechanics, they‚Äôre easy to learn and when you can eventually hit like 30 hit combos you feel untouchable. Another good aspect of this game are the constant updates and daily/weekly challenges. they keep the game interesting without necessarily getting repetitive. I‚Äôve never gotten bored playing because as soon as i‚Äôm getting tired of fighting AI in story mode and prize fights, I can challenge myself on versus where you can win with numerous strategies and there are infinite possibilities of good teams to destroy people with. this game runs incredibly smooth, and i‚Äôm playing on a 4 year old iphone 8 with pretty much no storage left, but this game is the smoothest game i‚Äôve ever played on IOS. hard to believe this is a phone game. basically this game is god tier. admins if there‚Äôs one thing i‚Äôd like to see different is that i‚Äôm coming to the end of story mode even tho i‚Äôm lvl 48, and the story is mad interesting too, so i‚Äôd love to see continuation if that‚Äôs possible.

Sprint for the leaderboards in the sequel to one of the App Store's most popular endless runners, which arrives with a host of fabulous improvements, from overhauled graphics to refined controls, original minecart and zip-line challenges, and much more. Originally this was my favorite game. As time went on they made more and more variations and maps for the game, which was fine. Lately, however, now that they‚Äôre on the money grubbing bandwagon, I noticed fewer coins on runs when you needed them. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough with all the money they must make on selling people gems and coins, they‚Äôve added aggravating ads. I must admit that I tried to buy out of the ends and for over two weeks they still kept showing even after I received my notice that payment was received. However I must amend my previous review because they did contact me through email, and the developers gave me directions which did in fact remove the aggravating ads. The developers have since asked me to revise my review, but I had been ill for a while. The review is deserved, and I have brought it back up to a five star. I always did love the game I just hated the ads. And now for a very reasonable price, you can get rid of them too thank you so much for helping me with this problem. I apologize for the delay in correcting my review, but I have had some health issues which thankfully seem to be subsiding. It‚Äôs a great game! I‚Äôve been playing this game for a long time (at the very least five years) and although I‚Äôve stopped for periods of time, I always come back. The new maps and characters are always amazing, and the global challenges are great.HOWEVER. There‚Äôs always a however. Other people have talked enough about the ads so I‚Äôm not going to talk about that. Something that bothers me a lot is that now coins and gems are practically useless besides Head starts and Save mes. Before, you could use coins to buy new characters or outfits and gems to buy new characters and maps. However, now you can only unlock the new characters on special events and you need to purchase the maps with real world money.As I said, I‚Äôve been playing for a long time, so I don‚Äôt know if the older characters and maps are still able to be purchased with coins and gems. But Pirate Cove, Volcano Island qnd Enchanted Palace (and its characters) can only be purchased with dollars and I think that‚Äôs very unfair.I understand that you guys need to make money, but I would hope that ads, Usain Bolt and people purchasing packages and coin doublers in the store would be enough. There‚Äôs no need to block most of your users from obtaining maps and characters, they should be able to be gained by putting hard work into the game and earning coins and gems.Sorry for the long rant, but I wish you would take these comments into account and make these assests achievable for anyone. Hello Runner, we really appreciate your feedback. We shall forward your message to our developers so that they can review and consider. We really thank you for your continued support and suggestions to help us improve the game. Thanks and take care. "

Some things could make this game even more amazing, maybe adding more levels, weapon and more customizations, for example maybe choosing difficulty in each misssion and survival level (this could be done by adding more zombie spawns or subtracting), and possibly customizing the survival match by choosing what zombies you want to face (like in boxhead where you select or de-select zombies like the acid spitting one and red one, altering difficulty and changing final score) also add  a kill count on the end of each level would be nice, maybe even add other ai survivors to help you on survival after outliving or killing a number of zombies. This game is near perfect, with these updates, it will be Godlike. In my original review I took issue with the sound problems the game developed after various iOS updates. Surprise! the game has been updated with 64 bit support and is ready for iOS 11. This is a creepy game about battling the undead as you desperately try to stay alive. You'll battle threw various areas as you try to not become an undead happy meal. Though maybe not state of the art graphically, it does what it needs to do to put the player in a world gone bad. The graphics are nice and the sounds and music are fantastic. My thanks to the developer for not giving up on this great game. "

The flight controls are still angering, but other than that it‚Äôs a pretty good game.You go on quests. There are bosses, Mini bosses and wild animals you can take on! Tame animals!Well, sort of.Players should be able to tame any animal they come across rather than the set three (Sabertooth, Wolf, Dragon). I like how the amount of land there is in the game is increasing, and that the graphics are decent. The gameplay time is still at a small, and the same concept of nymphs and books is still there. In your next game, here is what I suggest:I noticed there was a black and white dinosaur model that looks kind of like a spinosaurus (without the spine) and I like it a lot. Maybe you could center it around that one?Maybe it could have that power tree I have talked about in my review of ‚ÄúClan of Dragons‚Äù, and maybe you have to grow your dinosaur (actually growing it) and going on a newer concept. Like:1. You hatch (with a sibling?)2. You learn the basics (hunting, drinking)3. You go out and collect materials for armor and defeat bosses while growing4. Daily quests!Again, these are all ideas, it‚Äôs your game and your models and these are only suggestions üòÅThanks! I have played quite a few simulated games and I‚Äôm trying to say this in the nicest way possible but there are a few of things That bothered me about this game and I literally just just downloaded it and tested it out on my iPod because I was curious and here‚Äôs what I think should really be fixed if anyone else has these problems.1.the controls are frustrating .2.the ads display around maybe every 5 seconds or so which I find annoying but if the ads weren‚Äôt all that constant I would probably like the game more.3.the game froze up while I was playing it and I had to press the home button it was showing the screen but I couldn‚Äôt do anything in the game  which is really annoying because at least make the screen go black or exit the game or something pls.If you fix this then I might consider playing it again but I honestly don‚Äôt know if I liked it that much I mean you couldn‚Äôt really do anything but what the game told you to and I think you should add a free play option and please fix the other stuff that I mentioned if possible and if you made it this far thx There is a few bugs when I get a mushroom and I try to tame an animal it sometimes the animal will stared to glitche and i wasted a mushroom and then I have to delete the game and download it back I have do it over 50 times "

A lot of work has obviously gone into the imagery and the music and the gameplay and the scares. The ""inventory wheel"" works quite well (except that it would be good to be able to control the rotation of the object displayed in the middle). My only negative criticisms are that the gameplay is quite short (markedly shorter than A Short Game) and the ending is a bit rushed, directorially speaking. Navigation is occasionally a little disorientating. There are a few scenes that are richly rendered but turn out to have only one thing you can do in them. And... the piano scale is incorrect (A to C should be a minor third, not a major third). All that said: a lot of work has gone into this and I enjoyed every minute of it. Ok I got stuck at the first game. Spoilers: there is a book that gives you hints but leads you to a flash drive that is blank. Ok all you needed to do is have a message on it like look for 4 letters and oh by the way they are not in the right order....THIS is the key. Then I would be like oh I get it, I can move on. But if you never catch on, you are stuck. Not everything was clear what clue went with what game. When it did, sometimes you didn‚Äôt know the order, then you were stuck again. I had a recording and a piano and didn‚Äôt know which Key was which. Looked at the top picture and still nothing. Then there was a missing key, do I need that to complete it first? No, but I‚Äôm stuck again. Then it was like ok I got 2 keys on the right, 3 on the left. Do I really need to just guess? Come on. When you get stuck there is no other room to go to. Then, you don‚Äôt know if you are focusing on the right rooms. I gave it 3 stars because I played a free glitch game and loved it. The one I paid for just frustrated me. So I love these guys. Love glitch games. What they did with Forever Lost and Ferris Mueller were great, and I'm giving this an extra star to boost them for that.Wasn't crazy about this one.- Don't like the new inventory and camera system. While the screen looks cleaner, it feels like more button presses and tap-hold-slide-slide to get where you need to go. More polished, harder to use.- This game felt more closed and episodic than their other works. The house ""resets"" periodically, meaning things change and new things come available for you to interact with, but not until you've already solved the puzzles up to that point. So I always felt like I was dealing witha small world and small set of puzzles at any one time. - Not a fan of the paranormal theme. If you have found yourself looking at this game, I encourage you to go get all three Forever Lost titles, Cabin Escape, and Ferris Mueller. They are all excellent. "

You should be able to have a settlement with people and survive. Maybe fishing in the next update with some boats. The lighting is a bit reflective at night like too shiny possibly a bug. Also one issue there is random ads popping up during the gameplay when I‚Äôm being attacked or doing something important. Please remove random ads popping up during gameplay and just have ads at the beginning of loading screens only so it won‚Äôt be bad! Just keep improving the game!Edit: Lights and torch‚Äôs can‚Äôt be placed anywhere no matter what I do! Game Bug? Ceiling light can‚Äôt be place on bottom floor ceiling or any game block I tried everything and it‚Äôs just red and won‚Äôt let me place it anywhere same with the torch. Game play is pretty smooth overall. My biggest disappointment was that lack of threat there is. There is not really much to worry about. The game is almost too easy. There are not that many items and really nothing to discover or unlock. More things to gather and possibly fishing would be a start. You can‚Äôt use spears while walking or running. Even the ‚Äúred‚Äù threat level characters go down in a spear or two. There is never enough enemy to kill you. You can take the time to gather the items you need to build guns or other things but why when it is basically given to you through supply drops. It is not a challenge and is only fun for a little while. You have to be standing near the furnace for metal to keep being created, and that can get really annoying. This game could be really good with a lot more development. More enemies. More items. Possible an enemy that will wander more. I would like to have a sense of some sort of danger to be on the lookout for. A map would also be amazing. Different terrain would make things a little more interesting. Larger creates to put things in is also a thing that would be amazing. Even the metal boxes don‚Äôt hold very much and you have to have a lot of them. Overall I would not waste your time on this game. Not enough to keep you busy and interested Hello developers, I hope you read this so you can make this request your priority to improve this game. First of all, this game has lots of potential and much better than the last Survival simulator game. Just a few requests to make this game really good. First of all, remove the in game ads so this game is actually playable! I don‚Äôt care if you have ads when you exit or enter a game but all I ask is don‚Äôt put ads while playing the game. People will not like that and might quit if that keeps up. Secondly, there needs to be a way to respawn to your base or put a home symbol on the minimap. Like Survival Simulator, the bed should be a waypoint to your base. This will avoid people losing their base and would make the game a lot more smoother. Last thing, there are a few bugs that should be fixed, one is when I drag a item to another hot bar, sometimes it freezes on the screen and I see it even when I close out of my inventory. Also items tend to randomly disappear for no reason, that should be fixed. Anyway I think these requests should be your main priority to make this game improve. More people will download when these are fixed. Also soon plz add multiplayer! Thanks. "

Artfully blending bold colors, stirring sound design, and intriguing puzzles, the game establishes a contemplative mood sprinkled with moments of joyous surprise, ensuring the experience sticks with you long after you stop playing. Walking and sailing through the pop-up book Japanese landscape is a lovely experience. No mayhem, no extreme brain-bending puzzles. More akin to an artwork than your average game. The clues provided are just enough to keep you exploring. I definitely wanted the game to last longer and also wished for a more engaging story line. I hope the team comes up with another, more complex adventure in the same style. This game is a great idea, but it feels like a prototype of a full game. Not quite polished enough and too short.The puzzles are sometimes so simple that you end up looking around for a more difficult solution only to be surprised that all you have to do to solve them is count things. A lesson could be learned from games like The Room.The game in general is beautiful, but there are certain details where shortcuts seem to have been taken and more fluid movement of the character could give the game a more complete feel. It feels like some movements of the character were skipped to come back to later perfected (only they weren‚Äôt).And finally, the game is really short. Like one hour worth of gameplay. It feels like the designers developed a few levels as a prototype and then they just never developed any more. For the $3.99 price, it feels like you should be getting more.Great idea for a game, but just seems like someone rushed to get this out the door when too many things were left unfinished/unperfected.

The only thing is.. They should make it more realistic. For instance cubs should grow up, and I realized that as you walk along everything loads as you approach it, which means there is a blank horizon, which makes it seem less real, should have completely loaded horizon. Lastly, Gluten  free games  should not let you eat an animal as big as an elephant in one bite. I know they have a policy against blood or gore but they should at least let there be bite marks on the animal as you eat it. However, though I still recommend this game since it's pretty fun  to survive in the jungle and desert. So I thought instead of having a little home spot BORING you could have a den similar to the one in the lion sim and there could be a hole so you can go in the den also you should have a lot more Cubs like six 2 at level 5 and the rest at level ten and there should be water falls and you can transport to other simulators that the player has and you could have wars with the animals from the players Simao you have to have a bigger map to all the sims that the player has and you can pick things up with your mouth and steal animals Cubs (the ones from the players sims if they have any) and when you bring it to your home/den there would be an button that says ""raise""and if you press it the cub is yours although there would be a 98% chance that the parents would be looking for its cub or pup and there would be different ways to steal Cubs or pups make the next update on my birthday August 14th bye I love this game‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòÇüòäüòäüòäüòäüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòäüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé I have a few suggestions , the Tigers head looks smaller than its body so make it bigger if your going to make a ultimate tiger simulator also the control movements need fixing  you should update them to uws controls.

I understand you need ads but do you need to let the game keep playing while an ad is playing. Just now I almost killed Bigfoot and a bear saw me, I started killing it when an ad played, all I heard was the bear growling and my character grunting, when I could skip the ad I had 1 hit point left, pure horror, the last thing I saw was a bear on its hind legs, growling, striking then...game...over. Please fix this, like, pause the game while an ad is playing or place the ads differently, please. Thank you for reading my review. This is a really fun game to play, I can see the idea behind it, but there is so much that you guys can do to improve it that it honestly hypes me up. Some ways in which you guys can improve the game are:             ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-: change the way that you land, make the landing more realistic, also have there be dead bodies around the map(it will give the game more anxiety)....Have there be more missions other than just killing bigfoot, maybe having you save someone that bigfoot has captured or something like that...the map needs to have more to it like more structures more places to explore-Now one big thing is co-op online if you guys are able to get online multiplayer into this game it would be HUGE-ex. Let players create a gameroom so that you can play with your friends and 2v1 Bigfoot. That would be very fun......Also the ads that keep poping up when u play are annoying it would be nice to remove those...those are just ways that u guys can improve the game because I believe I can be a very good game, but other than that keep them updates coming guysüí™üëçüëç This game is great! The graphics aren‚Äôt too bad, but it‚Äôs good enough that you can actually play the game. But it is missing some things and stuff that needs to be removed. For instance, i‚Äôm pretty sure no one likes ads popping up every minute or so when your getting attacked by a giant ape in their own home. And bears, they need to get removed. They are too buggy, and frankly they are the only thing you worry about when your out in the forest. You worry about them more than you do worry about Bigfoot. And when I had spawned it I was instantly attacked by them. What it‚Äôs missing: A storyline. There is no reason your hunting Bigfoot, you just jump out of a helicopter WITHOUT a parachute. Which is weird. Why can‚Äôt the helicopter just land instead of jumping out all Fortnite *cough* Fartnight! Style? You just land at a house in a forest. Anyways, the rest of the game is wonderful! "

I found that just letting it drop works, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be a great mechanic when your fighting against the clock to not get too much loot when your being forced to wait for the animation to finish. Also, Overloot happens waaay to often to be considered a penalty, I‚Äôve gotten it 3 times in a row between monsters after watching an AD to stop it, this just feeds in the suspicion that it‚Äôs probably been adjusted to get AD revenue out of players to prevent any in game loses Hello Zom! We are sorry you encountered issues with the board, we have greatly improved the grid and its inner workings in this last update, we believe you will find the gameplay more fluid now. We hope you can give us another try and we appreciate the positive rating! - Overloot Team It‚Äôs a really good game design. It‚Äôs very enjoyable and challenging and forces you to play fast and think fast. Unfortunately, as others have noted, once you hit around level 22ish the game difficulty more than doubles. To get daily rewards you have to do a lottt more than previously. The game introduces bombs that drop every 5-15 seconds on some enemies that destroy your weapons and armor. I thought by picking up the bomb and holding it in an area with no items it would be okay but that does not help at all. Items would just disappear randomly from my grid with me not being able to do anything. Enemies started almost 2-3 hitting me with green gear all around and it would be gone and I would get this flurry of attacks that drains alllll of my health after my gear was destroyed. It‚Äôs like they know you get invested around 20 or so and ramp the difficulty up a lot just so you get tired of losing and shovel cash into the game. I‚Äôve played level 22 three times now and lose to the final enemy with bombs every 5 seconds and can‚Äôt do anything about it. Sorry, but this feels like a cash grab at this point. At first, this game is great, but the more you play the more you see why everyone gives it less stars. Tavern quest for collecting a certain amount of gold is too high, it keeps increasing throughout the day. My first day of playing the gold to finish the quest was like easy, finished it no problem, but day two of playing, I didn‚Äôt notice it until it was at around 8,000,000 and increased to 10,700,000 before the day was over and my 3rd day playing its like 20mil and I probably can only reach 1 or 2 million by playing daily. I think it increases every time I log in as if it added the next day‚Äôs quest amount. Power ups lag. I clicked whistle but still overlooted then after the video and the selling, the whistle was used and merchant came again. Ate food delivery still died, even though the animation and healing amount showed. This game could be great if it was smoother. I almost regret spending money on this game, just glad that these bugs showed themselves early before I spent more. "

IMO, this one took it up a couple more notches with greater puzzle interaction, greater depth of story, greater length, and, of course, an extra helping of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe that just happened!‚Äù. For me, it was insanely fun, and even though there were a couple things I didn‚Äôt quite understand, I still managed to get through it without any help, so I‚Äôm feelin‚Äô like I‚Äôm ‚Äòon top of the cave‚Äô. To boot, the end of this one leaves you with an ominously creepy feeling about what‚Äôs coming next. I can‚Äôt imagine how they‚Äôre going to top this one, but fortunately, I don‚Äôt have to, cuz I‚Äôm getting ready to download the next one. I‚Äôm already savoring the anticipationüòã. Update:Still can‚Äôt finish. Made a mistake in order of navigation of points on radar with no way to correct & no way to get the next cube.  After 3 attempts just deleting this chapter. Watching the walkthrough to see how it comes out. Hopefully ‚ÄúParadise & Paradox‚Äù chapters are better thought out. Too bad, still love the series, but disappointed that developers didn‚Äôt foresee this.***************************Love the series, but very frustrated with the ink bottle glitch. Took the ink bottle in part 2 early in the game which apparently caused something to break & after watching the walkthrough (tried the hints) no fish would appear. Restarted part 2 waiting until after getting the pearl to take the ink bottle. Tried a couple of different settings on the radar, now I‚Äôm stuck again because I can‚Äôt change the settings & get the black cube or octopus.  Again checked the walkthrough & found I can‚Äôt change the settings on the radar. OMG, have to reset again. Really! DEVELOPERS, Please fix so the ink bottle doesn‚Äôt mess up the settings & freeze the radar. Will reset again because I love the Rusty Lake game, but I‚Äôm soooo frustrated. Incredibly well made. Although it‚Äôs not my most favorite cube escape, this was still really up there on the list because of how well the game was made. I absolutely adored the additions of how you could interact with things. The graph bit where you had to find a point and travel there by changing the direction and moving forward was also a nice touch, along with the book and how you had to look at one thing and figure it out gradually. Very well made, I have no doubt paradox will be just as good if not better. "

I love it that it helps give you glimpse what it was like for people during the time.  I also love you gave some glimpses of the phases of Operation Cobalt.  But there is a glitch for me (though I do not doubt others will have problems as well).  When I go to buy certain in-app purchases and watch an ad for temporary episode unlock, the app doesn‚Äôt pull up anything. As in I can‚Äôt buy anything because the menu won‚Äôt pop up, and neither will the ad.  Do you think you all could fix this (though I understand if you can‚Äôt as this is a four year game)? This game is awesome! Even though the TV show it's modeled after was absolutely horrendous - I mean how were they able to take an award winning recipe (TWD) and make the biggest piece of crap on TV (FEAR TWD)!? But that's another review I have to write on a different site. The gameplay is simple and the visual style totally complements the zombie apocalypse feel. I also like how scenes, characters, etc from the show were integrated seamlessly into the game. Unfortunately, all the in-game purchases that are required in order to progress through the story are so rediculously  expensive, it becomes very slow going very quickly and brings to the fore front the fact that the developers want to make as much money off you as possible, which kind of kills the whole thing. Great game but be ready to drop some cash or watch a crap load of commercials. I love this game, this concept, and especially the fact hat you can actually save survivors! But the big problem I referenced is the fact that when I win Episode 1, Season 1, it doesn‚Äôt unlock the next episode (not sure if it‚Äôs supposed to though), and when I try to watch an ad to use it for the next 24 hours, it doesn‚Äôt work! And, there isn‚Äôt even a way to pay money or something to unlock an episode! "

That‚Äôs the idea that sparked a world-building phenomenon in Mojang‚Äôs amazing Minecraft. Since the game's release on the App Store, a steady stream of meaningful updates has kept this cube-filled universe fun, fresh, and jam-packed with exciting features. I enjoy this game till this day, if you knew like me what the nether reactor core and when you could glitch stack armour. It has changed so much and suddenly blew up out of know where! I have been creating boat racing maps, and almost everything I can imagine. If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it‚Äôs almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it. Thank you! I‚Äôve been playing Minecraft PE since 2011 and it‚Äôs awesome! But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do. "

The game is designed to make the developers money, its a business.  If your looking for a free game to play for 30 seconds several times a day, you are good to go on this one.  Want to play for longer, it‚Äôs going to cost you money.  50-60 spins to get a bonus game (free spins or pick feature) and 8 out of ten times you will get between 2 and 12 times your bet.  There are no rules or oversight for online casinos, so if you‚Äôre expecting the odds of winning to be the same as is real casinos you will be disappointed.  Read the privacy policies, they do collect your device ID, IP address, and purchase and play habits.  You push the spin button and then the results are sent to your device...you can see how that can be manipulated, despite their claims that all payouts are based on Vegas like algorithm.  Real casinos have gaming commissions to ensure slots are truly random within the algorithm.  No such requirement here, so don‚Äôt expect the same results. Hi! Sorry to hear about this. If you haven't done so, please get in touch with our Player Support Team http://zynga.my/GoTContactSupport so we can take a closer look. If possible, please include your Player ID.Thanks for your time and patience. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones than this slot is a must. Gorgeous graphics with music taken right from the show including the theme song. Each slot features different music form the show. Plus, the voice form the actual actors is used in each slot and you hear them frequently, even on small wins. Their lines taken from the show seem to be extensive as they are not repeated to often. You also have a ton of fun and interesting things to do like challenges, and joining a house to fight against other houses with rewards and exploring the map. Lots going on. Only negative, and it doesn‚Äôt take away for the game is the slots from Vegas are not here (like the original game of thrones), but that is to be expected since they are Aristocrat owned.Very enjoyable, just wish the coins were a little more generous (you can collect them every hour but you don‚Äôt get that much).Highly recommended, every fan will be very pleased with hearing their favorite lines from the show, music, etc. best slot on the market (and I play a lot of slot apps). Can‚Äôt recommend it enough. Positives: If I could give 5 stars to something in the game, it‚Äôs the graphics, they are amazing! Very cool and stunning visuals with intense music score. It is a fun game....When you actually win.  There are a lot of different options for games which you can switch off from, and keep changing it up. Negatives: Bonuses are hard to come by as are the small special features that randomly pop on the screen. It just does not keep it interesting when all you see is reels spinning every turn.  When you do get a bonus, especially one when you have to choose an icon to either uncover free spins or a bonus wheel, 90% of the time you will get the bonus wheel which usually does not pay much. The game flat out does not let you keep playing for an extended period of time or pay out to keep it fun. I honestly check in throughout the day to get my bonus coins, start playing at a low bet and will be done within 5 minutes. This does NOT keep the player interested or wanting to come back, and I am not paying money for millions of coins that could just dwindle to zero within a matter of minutes. Very frustrating. The pop ups that come on the top of the screen showing players that have won jackpots is also very annoying. I really don‚Äôt care about who won a jackpot every 5 seconds because it ruins the concentration and enjoyment I am trying to have on MY game. The developers need to do better.

Rest assured that we will take good note of this so we can improve our game to better our players' experience. Have a nice day. "

It‚Äôs why I make games and specifically open worlds. I like exploring nature and using my imagination And I want others to have a place you can do the same. NimiAn Legends feels like it‚Äôs a real place to me in some ways and I am always trying to learn better ways to bring it to life. Right now I‚Äôm working on a new world that‚Äôs a lot larger and I hope to bring you an even more massive natural world to explore soon. Vandgels and BrightRidge are two places that have been in my head since I was a kid and it‚Äôs a lot of fun to finally see these characters in an actual game. Your spirited feedback and five star review also really support me. As you said I‚Äôm one person so I also am boosted when people say kind things and it means a lot to me that the experience meant something positive to you:) I will keep it up! First off let me start off by saying that this game is absolutely one of the most visually stunning games I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on for a mobile game. I will say that the developer has shown great care and love to the scenery the characters in the story and some really great plot twists. I fully support your development of these games and of any future endeavors you might undertake. I will say that I am a person who does not write many reviews about games that I play because I play so many it‚Äôs not worth it for me, however coming across this title I knew that I had to speak up because I could absolutely tell the amount of effort put into this game. I have recently downloaded another title by this developer and look forward to checking it out as well. Thank you very much for putting the effort into this as you have. I am at a loss on the great reviews for this game.  Perhaps it does not work correctly with the newest ipads?  I am using an ipad pro with 256gb of storage, over half of which is free and I had no other programs open.  My experience with this and the prior Nimean game is that the controls are utterly horrible.  Camera swings about wildly when you try and move your character and constantly works in too close.  Changing control and view settings did not help.  Game does not seem to be designed for a touch screen and there is no onscreen joypad appearing even when I select that option.  Simply agonizing to try and make the character do anything.  Also, no audio speech, just a compressed squealy babble when characters talk - text does appear at the bottom of the screen but I tend to miss it - just weird as speech bubbles do appear most of the time when characters talk - however there are no words in the bubbles.  Also difficult to tell who is speaking and who they are speaking to due to camera jumping around and getting too close in.  There may be a great experience here, but I‚Äôll never know it.  Life is too short. There are lots of great games out there that work properly - better to play one of those than struggle with this.  Oh well. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

Transforming your klutzy ninja into a capable combatant using a variety of objects‚Äîlike trampolines and balloons‚Äîis an absolute joy. The easy-to-understand challenges make this an excellent choice for new gamers, and the incredible array of items and interactions ensures that experienced gamers are charmed silly. Hey developers and people who have or are thinking to download this game! I have been playing Clumsy Ninja a lot. I used to play it on my iPad but now I have it on my iPhone 7 Plus. This game is amazing! The graphics and animations are beautiful. The chicken and squirrel are so cute! Not only can you get animals that roam around, you can get different toys and training items! You can dress your ninja to give him style and even go to different places. This game is overall brilliant! I have only a few small suggestions. The first one is there is a small bug where the ninja will jump onto the bamboo trampoline and get glitched inside. Shortly after this happens, the ninja and trampoline fly into the air. This is only a minor bug and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the game much but just letting you know. The next thing is the XP gain. The XP gain is little too slow. Keep in mind I said a little. I don‚Äôt want you to change it to where I do one thing and level up. I‚Äôm only asking to increase it a little bit to where you still have to train with your ninja but you don‚Äôt have to constantly train over and over to get to the next level to finish a mission. This game is remarkable and amazing! I hope you read this and thank you! Hey! Just so you know, I LOVE this game! Every challenge, every photograph, every time the Chicken goes on my screen... But one of these challenges stood out to me. The ‚ÄúFace Yourself‚Äù Challenge. It requires ‚ÄúThe Shadow‚Äù Punching bag with Sensei saying ‚ÄúGet The Shadow punch bag. It‚Äôs the dark, mysterious one...‚ÄùNow if you are also a Sonic fan like me, doesn‚Äôt this sound like a Shadow the Hedgehog reference? Shadow the Hedgehog is dark and mysterious. The Shadow punch bag is in Shadow‚Äôs colors: black and red. Plus, Shadow is Sonic‚Äôs rival. At first, SEGA made it so almost every character in Sonic Adventure 2 thought Shadow was Sonic and that it was Sonic who stole the Chaos Emerald. Sonic calls him ‚Äúfaker‚Äù because Shadow almost looks exactly like him. And they almost equal in power, if not one of them has more. It was almost as if Sonic was facing himself...But hey, I‚Äôm just guessing a bit here. You are probably trying to describe a ninja being the punch bag. Or maybe you aren‚Äôt. Oh well, I still love this game anyway. Thanks for creating this! "

This  game is good right now because it gets players moving during quarantine. Also I would like to say that the energy And coins gets annoying. If you don‚Äôt have enough you have to buy some and no one wants to keep buying stuff for a game over and over. I read in the other reviews that others were having that issue to. Also In the vault you can delete items. I would like it to ask twice instead of once to delete an item because I accidentally deleted a very useful potion. In the chambers In Hogwarts it doesn‚Äôt let me switch back to AR so can u make that easier please. Since we are in quarantine I would like it if more objects came closer to me because we can‚Äôt leave the house as much as before. Also I live in a small community and I have to ride my bike half a mile to town hall to visit an inn and find traces. Also you have to spend money to fill energy.          Other than that whole paragraph this game is great. You should try adding a hogsmeade. Thank You for taking your time to read my Review and I hope you take my suggestions into consideration.                           -Addicted Player I really enjoy playing this game...it‚Äôs fun, I enjoy the story line, picking a profession, and all that stuff.  However, there are a few things that I think would make the game significantly better.  1) It‚Äôs been said by many already‚Äîspell energy.  Can their be other ways to obtain this?  Specifically for people in rural areas where inns and greenhouse and few and far between.  Can we earn like 1 spell energy every 30 minutes or something?  It would be awesome to be able to wake up with a full energy bank each day, and would also make me want to play the game more frequently because I know that I could. 2) Can Masterful casts actually mean something?  It‚Äôs pretty stupid that a low level threat can resist a masterful cast.  What‚Äôs the point in trying to get a masterful cast if all you get is XP?  There is literally no other perk, as it doesn‚Äôt at all seem to affect your likelihood of capturing a foundable.  I have defeated a high level threat on a ‚Äúgood‚Äù cast, but had a low level threat depart after a masterful cast?  Seems stupid and pointless to have casting ability only count toward XP. 3) Storage.  I know this has been said by others as well, but it‚Äôs annoying to constantly have to delete ingredients/potions...particularly if you‚Äôre trying to stock up for a Wizard battle.  I realize this is to make people spend actual money buying coin to increase their storage, but it really makes me want to play the game less...not more. I agree that it‚Äôs a lot of fun for Harry Potter fans, and there are a lot of fun features. But in the American version, it‚Äôs hard to find inns unless they‚Äôre literally right there (within a mile) because you can‚Äôt zoom out on the map in game to find an inn nearby (I.e. within 5 mi) (and the online maps don‚Äôt work well either). I also don‚Äôt like that the game isn‚Äôt as intuitive as Pok√©mon Go‚Äîthere‚Äôs a learning curve, and right now I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing or how to work things. It would be nice if here was somewhere to go to review the storyline as well, because there‚Äôs a lot of moving pieces and it‚Äôs a little hard to follow. Also, the graphics are shoddy in some places (especially the people‚ÄîGinny was very slender in the movies, yet she looks overweight in the graphics, Luna is only recognizable because she‚Äôs he only one that wears that hat, Neville does not look all there, etc.). and the profile pictures will update on our personal app, but our friends can‚Äôt see it (my husband and I play together, and we will have to show each other our phones to show each other our profile pics). I realize it‚Äôs like this in Pok√©mon Go too, but I also don‚Äôt like that you would regularly have to travel to different countries to get everything (e.g. that awesome opal eye dragon in about a week). So you would have to be incredibly rich to get everything. BUT there‚Äôs a lot to do and explore, and I am mostly having fun with it. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

Inkle Studios‚Äô beautiful creation is stitched together with wonderful typography, gorgeous music, and a story you‚Äôll return to time and time again. I am a video game tester and in my free time I like to test out mobile games. I have been so addicted to this game for a long time, after a while it does get boring. But this game is still great, if you are looking to read something and have an interactive adventure at the same time, this game is perfect for you. This game might even be educational on some levels. If you want an action packed thriller of an adventure, the money this costs will not go to waste. The reason I am leaving a four star and not a five is because at times the game can get annoying, and that can make it fun. It was all realistic just like the movie until, I got lost on ice and kidnapped by mermaids and I lost the game because of that. Overall the game is spectacular, 4/5. I'm not much of a game player but I was going on a trip, so I googled games and this one came up as one of the most popular, best games, so I got it. I have gone around the world now four times, and each time I learned some new things about the planet, different countries, oceans, cities, etc. I had to look up cities and countries on maps. We died once at the North Pole because we thought it would be brilliant to make the smallest circumference; another time we  didn't intend to go there but made a navigation mistake and almost died but were rescued and made it around the world in 64 or 65 days. On another trip we were a few days late and lost the wager. We went around the world again and made it in about 74 days.  I've learned that when the valet makes the wisest, less reckless decisions, we do better. If he picks up something not his, he suffers the consequences. If he goes for an evening walk, he might gather useful information or he might get pick-pocketed or arrested. Take notes, useful for other trips. Buy maps at new markets so you get more routes, then sell them.  Take care of Monsieur Fogg. Buy items at markets that you can later sell. Occasionally earn extra money doing chores at your hotel.  Make friends. Make sure you have enough money by visiting banks. New York to London by airship is a good route. Engage in conversations and read the news occasionally.   Love and compassion usually have good outcomes. This is a great game. 5 stars. "

I do love this game a lot! But...a lot of the items on here are locked and I do not want to buy the full package. Maybe you could make some more of the items free. And when u are dressing up the groom and bride you can only watch one add for one of the items which means we would have to choose what we want. Cause what if we wanted both the lipstick and the eyelashes. And when u watch the add for the bride on the groom u can only have 2 choices hair, and facial hair. In my opinion I do not like facial hair. So if you are reading this please consider doing the things I have noted. I have only done about 6 wedding and it was very difficult to make them look decent with the little choices of dresses, hair, pants, etc. I also do not like how u have to watch adds in order to get the items. I know u want to advertise different games of yours but just make some more items unlocked. Please consider making some more items free and unlocked. Thank you for reading this whole thing I know it‚Äôs kinda long. Let me begin by saying that this app is by far one of the best free apps to offer what it does. However the fact that you guys are promoting that you have fixed the bugs on this app is a bit misleading given the fact that you have not. I was able to get through about 24 weddings and I am now unable to continue due to the same screen coming up even when I close out and reboot the app. It‚Äôs also unfortunate that you guys have us watch so many adds when the only things you offer as rewards should already be apart of the dressing options. As a business owner I understand the demand and promotion for paying further into the app but you guys are a bit over priced for what you‚Äôre offering. In conclusion I actually really enjoyed this game and the only tips I have for the wonderful people who created this app are as follows l: 1. More color coded free options with matching attire 2. There shouldn‚Äôt be more shorter hairstyles than longer given the fact that we are dealing with brides. 3. There should be matching attire items for each outfit chosen for the groom and bride and the bridesmaids and groomsmen to match accordingly. 4. Consider setting up adds to offer some of the things you are asking us to pay for, it supports the player to want to purchase further into what you are selling if they could at least try the locked outfits on. No further tips at this time. Thank you for the idea and the app that you have put out.       Best Regards, Brown Cosmetics Hey there,Thanks a lot for your helpful feedback. We're constantly working on making our game the best it could be!If you have any issues, please contact us at support@tabtale.com and we'll do our best to assist you.Thanks for playing!Dream Wedding Planner Team So i got this Game and it was so fun!! Until the thing I dread the most happened an add. Now I thought this was just a one time thing I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong I did watch adds to get stuff but this add came without me clicking a ‚Äú watch ad‚Äù icon. Then more and more came till my screen just went black I clicked my ho e button and then clicked the game again and guess what ..... it was still black. Anyways so I cleared my history and it worked but anytime an ad pops up the same things happen. Now I don‚Äôt know if it is just my device glitching or something else. Another thing is that the Ads are sometimes inappropriate and I don‚Äôt like I don‚Äôt know if y‚Äôall can change there being less ads but at least choose appropriate ones. Anyways but other than that it‚Äôs a great game I also have a suggestion you should have a thing to where you can dress your character. So yeah please fix thread situation and have a great day! "

I just have a few small issues. Missions where you have to defend the generator are pretty tough on legendary. Elites shred through its health, making groups of elites horrifying when you‚Äôre low on ammo. When I try to leave to get some extra ammo, I have to watch the generator‚Äôs health vanish in those quick seconds. The only other issue I have is the shotgun on higher difficulties. Using it for any boss or brute groups is a bit of a suicide mission due to its range and damage. While it works wonders on groups of jackals and grunts, trying to use it on bosses makes the gun pretty underwhelming. Besides that, everything else is great, especially with those Reach helmets! Some Reach shoulder pads would definitely be worth grinding for too... The game is fun. And I‚Äôm glad that you have the option to play offline! The controls are a little funky. Crouching and descending is sort of an issue. I think that you should be able to slowly hover down if you hold the jump button just like how you can hover in Halo 5. This next thing is not a necessity but maybe play around with it... maybe add a up and down aiming mechanic? But you should add the ability to run backwards and shot by sliding the shoot button unless if you think that would be too overpowered (to even make this possible you would have to change the shoot button into a joystick). Definitely make the maps bigger! That is one of the biggest problems! Upgrading weapons requires more work than it should and you should add a weapon point system so that we can choose which stat of the weapon to upgrade. The Magnum (or pistol) is WAY too weak!!! Definitely buff it! Please add Prometheans to the game and make them have more health than the other enemies (because they have more health than the other enemies in the real game). Please try to add some or maybe even all of these suggestions to the game. Keep up the good work! For what it is it‚Äôs great. It works. There isn‚Äôt any game breaking bugs, or anything.I‚Äôd say there is plenty of room for improvement. -covenant weapons-actual multiplayer-2 punch kill on Spartans-explanation on weapon ‚Äúupgrades‚Äù (how far you can go what you can expect) -Shield Jackals should be one hit from behind with precision weapons. Just how the none shielded ones are.-redo the Hayabusa, and Recon Helmet pixel animation. Every other helmet is so perfect, but then those two (the ones you get from ranking up) are weird especially hayabusa-add red flames we have blue flames as a last unlock item. -don‚Äôt make the grind for max rank shorter it‚Äôs good. Makes it worth the time you spent on this game to unlock it.-chest armor pieces-add armor effects from halo reach-maybe make the sprites bigger to make them a bit more accurate? ... I‚Äôm sure a lot of this is being tackled already. Some of it I might be a bit needy. I don‚Äôt know how big this studio is. This is already a really good spinoff game for what it is. The Credit system is good. Gives enough credits without feeling the need to buy them. Would definitely pay to get rid of the ads. It‚Äôs like 5 bucks. Definitely worth it. I did pay for the ad free credit bundle. Shop is nice. Prices are the same for each armor piece variant. The colors are amazing. Nice variety of armor colors.I‚Äôd pay money for this to become better. GoFundMe, or Whatever you want to use. "

Spectacular visuals and spellbinding music bolster an epic tale that pits you‚Äîone of Earth‚Äôs few survivors‚Äîagainst the monsters who stole our homeworld. Fighting in your War-Mech battle suit‚Äôs a blast, with legions of ghastly foes ready for your lethal sword and fearsome firepower. If you like games long on style and ambition, this one‚Äôs for you.  I don't really know where to begin with this one. I'd have to say that this is the best--ever--game in the App Store. I was hooked from the minute the intro came on and from just that I knew it'd be awesome. I don't commonly write reviews(this is my third), but I felt like my reaction to this had to be shared. It was hard to see how a game could be even considered with a ten dollar price tag slapped on it, yet surprisingly I felt relieved I spent so much. Well, not that I spent so much, but rather what I got was beyond satisfactory. All of the RPG apps out there, as fun as they are, find it difficult to compete with this. Graphics are phenomenal and there's no lag, at least not on my device. The controls are perfect for mobile, and there's a ton of moves and upgrades to use(but not so many it doesn't distract you from the action). Yes, and the action! Nonstop yet diverse with each level--perfectly balances the story and combat. So if you're like me and can't make up your mind for your life, I recommend this game to you, and I promise...it's worth every penny. I mean, it's about a human-operated robot with a sword and laser gun fighting mechanically enhanced mutants in a dystopian future. What more could you ask for? I don‚Äôt get the pricing strategy RELATIVE to other games in the genre/App Store. That being said, I‚Äôll drop 10 bucks on my way home from work on a pack of craft beer; I‚Äôd rather spend money on a quality game than have the alternative: ads, IAPs, money grabs, and $99 pack of ‚Äògems‚Äô, so thank you for that. It seems to me like a price more in line with competitors would allow this game to stay relevant in the marketplace longer, but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a strategy behind all that somewhere in the business model: or they love their own creation too much to price according to others in the App Store. (Again, I don‚Äôt normally play free games, I like getting a self-contained game and gladly pay for it).  Pricing strategy aside, PLEASE update so the game fits my iPhone X screen before I beat it! The controls can be frustrating when you‚Äôve learned how a boss moves and trying to get out of the way before a planned attack: mostly because my left thumb slides off the small format game area (iPhone X) and the player just stands there and gets hit. But there‚Äôs a learning curve to it (again, still giving 5 stars)If you like hack n slash/ level up games; I would recommend adding this one to your collection. Thanks team!

Packing silky smooth, lightning-fast combat, Hyper Light Drifter is a blast‚Äîeven when you‚Äôre just admiring the scenery. First off, fantastic game! I love playing this. Awesome storyline and reaches back to my younger years of playing Zelda etc. I play it on IPad and yes I also wish the controls were easier cause you can‚Äôt get the dash room achievements at all with IPad control system. Here‚Äôs the thing that happened. In the southern zone, the one module room that turns out to be a fake module and then you have to fight a mini boss. So as I have understood, it is still a module right? Cause after I defeat it you go to the next room and then pull the real module. But on my map the fake mod is still highlighted pink and I still haven‚Äôt been able to find the eighth module. I have looked all over and tried to reasearch the maps but it always points me back to the fake room. Is this a bug? Should I make a new game and try again? I also noticed something that happened when I equipped the Tanuki sword once I attained it, there would be an error window popping up and the game shuts down. Now all that is said, these are all things that I‚Äôm sure starting a new game will hopefully fix but I wanted you to know about it. I am a really big fan of this game cause it‚Äôs just too much fun. It‚Äôs nice to play something that actually feels like a real game with substance and it looks like real love was put into the making of it. Cheers! This game is amazing! So much fun and very rewarding! Only thing that needs to be done is the ability to remap buttons. Certain upgraded attacks are too hard to do in combat because my thumb is controlling movement and I have to hit two buttons at the same time to do dash attack. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be taken care of! Thank you for this amazing game! Best purchase in along time!!! Additional feedback... So I‚Äôve been trying to collect everything before I beat my first play through of the game and I went ahead and researched where the outfits were *slight spoiler I guess* and I see that one of the outfits is locked until you can get 800 consecutive dashes in the dash arena... I‚Äôve had a great time with the touch controls but I‚Äôm not gonna lie it kinda is disappointing that I will never get that outfit because it‚Äôs actually impossible to achieve 50 consecutive dashes with a touch screen let alone 800 lol. I hope you guys can add some kind of compromise so we can unlock the outfit! I understand this could have been missed in hindsight sense it‚Äôs much more achievable with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. Here‚Äôs to being hopeful that I can unlock everything!! Thanks again! "

I‚Äôve passed all the levels and got all the stars. I was so obsessed with this game until I finished all levels. I ended up deleting it after going through all levels a second time. This game is my favorite ever and I would love a Silly Walks 2! Please take my advice because I think a lot of other people would like this too! Maybe you could use some things from the first one too and add more characters to choose from. Also, I love this game but on the first Silly Walks I had a hard time beating the bosses. Maybe make them easier or take them out if you make another Silly Walks. I ended up getting through the bosses after a while though but if you make it easier it would be less time. Another thing that you could do differently is maybe adding more levels because of how addicting this game is! I was so addicting I didn‚Äôt play anything else and I got through the whole game very quickly so more levels would be great! Thanks so much and I love your work!ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è I was looking forward to playing the app Silly Walks as it was on the app stores front page. I downloaded the app and thought it was great well, at first. The app was great then I go onto the next level the second level. It was too hard for me of course it may not be hard for anyone else but it was too hard for me I couldn‚Äôt get past the waffle iron without getting burned. I tried to dashing. That wouldn‚Äôt work! Just a little hard ‚Äì at least for me.Second thing. I was looking forward to this super cute little foods. I thought oh maybe if I get more foods would be easier for me to get pass through certain levels. But when I tried every single watch your video to get this fruit food. Nothing helped! And out was a tip to if you look at the app. So I do you spend a lot of time watching stupid videos that are pointless. The cubes are very hard to get in my opinion. Please make it easier to get cubes or new characters. If you are actually reading this please respond! I‚Äôd love to hear your response but overall I think that is OK. Just please fix this. This game really is a little gem I didn‚Äôt know what the gameplay was going to be like as I just downloaded 3 games at once to play while sitting in the car pool to pick up my brother and this game totally surprised me! It‚Äôs simple but fun, The art style and characters are stylized food items and the hazards are different kitchen utensils. Each level revolves around breaking your food friends out of a cage at the end of the level. New hazards are introduced at a steady pace and there‚Äôs even short cinematic‚Äôs for new bosses and items. Really glad I downloaded this game, the ads are evenly spaced and are about 20 seconds each but set further apart than most games. The characters are easily unlockable and there‚Äôs even a mini game that‚Äôs a racing game. Definitely give this game a try if you‚Äôre looking for a simple but fun and interesting puzzle-ish game.

I like that u have to find her purse, keys, and other stuff! What I think is annoying is that when u want to pause the game u have to listen to a ad, And whenever u die you have to listen to an ad. I also don‚Äôt like is right when you walk into her house she‚Äôs right there! I never get to Rome around her house. I think that you should add that when she‚Äôs following you, after a while she stops and walks away. And you should be able to go into other peoples houses. But otherwise it‚Äôs a great game! It is lonely in the neighborhood so please add more characters. One could be lawn mowing? This game is great but not going into other houses? Please make the player and granny go into the lakes. When holidays have come please decorate the neighborhood. Please make the player be able to go into other houses and barns. Make the player have a house too(and the player should be able to go in it). üò°the player can not climb trees so please make the player be able to climb trees.Q:is granny able to jump?Enough said.

Finally that day has come! This game may seem pretty expensive at $10, but if your a puzzle fan like myself then its well worth the money. The game is almost identical to how I remember it on the DS, aside from a few additions from the developers (all good btw). I only have two requests to make. 1) That after finishing the story, the remaining puzzles be moved the house; i‚Äôve finished the story but am missing a few of the puzzles and don't know where to find them. 2) I‚Äôve collected several (not all) of the puzzle solving charms, but i‚Äôm still not sure what they do, or if there just a new collectable thing for fun, which is fine if they are. Could there be some more description for them? Aside from that the game is awesome and I love playing it. Also, I don't recall if the weakly puzzles section was on the DS or not but I also really like that and if its new then I think its a great addition to the game (but save some puzzles for the next game üòâ). Again, great game and well worth it!!! Alright I‚Äôm gonna be real - Professor Layton is one of the best video games ever for those that love brain teasers and FANTASTIC plot and storyline. Sometimes the riddles are easy af and sometimes I‚Äôm stuck for three days. The music is wonderful - MUST BE LISTENED WITH EARBUDS OR YOU WONT HEAR IT - but once you pop those earbuds in it takes me back. I really enjoy the way the game has been adapted to fit the iPhone screen. They stayed true to the original for graphics, storyline, play, and the split screen divider. Absolutely worth the 10 bucks and I will love this game forever. Thank you for making it into an app! Should you do more I will 100% buy all the installments. Thanks for creating this!!! This is a tentative review since I just started playing yesterday; if I get a significantly different impression with more play I‚Äôll update again later. Lovely graphics, pretty slow-paced so far (story-based, which is fine, but I‚Äôm not finding the story all that interesting yet and I think the player is supposed to identify with the assistant but I‚Äôm just not feeling it), puzzles not that good so far, maybe better for children than adults. I‚Äôm extremely annoyed that the game doesn‚Äôt automatically save progress unless you click on the suitcase, when I opened the game today I‚Äôd lost all my progress from yesterday and had to start over. Overall plays more like a gaming station video game than a mobile app ‚Äî i get the impression it‚Äôs intended for longer sessions, and again it doesn‚Äôt automatically save progress. "

‚ÄéThe Quest Classic - HOL IV,"The Quest Classic - Hero of Lukomorye, Part IV: Death to the Deathless is an expansion to The Quest Classic, a beautifully hand-drawn, immersive and enchanting world full of exciting challenges. After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest Classic with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game. You're called to the northern port of Seversk in deep winter to join the Tzar, his militia and navy for a final assault on the fortress of Kozney the Deathless.  Kozney has new allies, elves and dwarf blacksmiths, as well as the spirits of his mighty, cunning dragons to back him up. Enjoy one of Argimon's trickiest dungeons yet and learn Silvergirl's deathless secret. New monsters, new spells, roughly 60 quests will take you throughout a beautiful land, including a mysterious island, to the ocean floor and to the Underworld. To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select ""The Deathless"" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 45 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.

If you're familiar with this expansion on PC/Palm OS, this has been expanded from the original, so it's totally worth getting it again :). If you're new to the series, this works as a standalone game; as well as a further chapter in the series. The artwork is gorgeous, the creatures are amazing, and the game is played from your character's point of view, so you can get caught up in it. If you're a fan of role-playing games, you get the monsters, the weapons, and the epic battles. If you like something more cerebral, there are brain-twisting riddles, witty dialogue, and opportunities to craft a strategy. Game is absolutely amazing and for some reason looks better to me than the other quest games (textures seem to look more clear). The only rhing i disliked with all the quest games (i own all 8) is the stupid sicknesses. Please for the love of god add an option to turn them off and on. Zarista games keeps outdoing themselves with every new expansion to the quest. This one is by far the best yet. Great replayability too. The quests are challenging enough that you can play several times and still find it tough each time "

It wasn‚Äôt just story it was the constant interaction of various elements that affected the routes you could take. Like (slight spoiler) in order to save a group of nomads you have to save up 2 points and invest them in charm otherwise you can‚Äôt save them or you if you kill off the bandits you can‚Äôt save the nomads. Along with a bunch of other stuff similar to that. It was a bit rough trying to figure out some stuff (although it wasn‚Äôt even that difficult) and map how to gain the most coin, items, equipment, interactions, exp, and fights in a single run, but once I figured it out it became a lot easier from there even to the point that endgame was became easy and I was pretty much rich. Tl:dr it‚Äôs an amazing, give it a shot, if you don‚Äôt like it by the time you have to pay, then don‚Äôt buy it. But as someone who did pay, it was worth it. Great job! Hi!Thank you for the kind words! We tried our best and I'm really happy you liked it. If you haven't already joined, we have a Discord server with loads of other players if you want to discuss possible secrets you might've missed out on or discuss lore etc. You'll find us at http://discord.untold-game.com/Adam This is such a cool game!There are a couple aspects that made me enjoy the game, first of all NO ADS. The game is only 5$ for the entire game, and it is definitely a smart move made by the devs Rather than spamming the game with ads. When a game has ads it makes the gameplay so much less... admirable. Every developer has to have a way to make money and this was the best approach.The gameplay itself is great as well, its a great and balanced game that is full of challenges! Rather than just winning every match you have to play with strategy and think about every move. Another cool aspect is the variety, there are different play styles for every body and for example you could be a brute with lots of health and dmg or a stealthy and agile character. If your a new player i have one tip for you, upgrade your perception at least a little, by doing this you can find extra content and find more secrets. All in all one of the best games ive ever played. UPDATE: Adam is amazing. I was pretty frustrated in my previous writing of this review and I actually emailed him (which I‚Äôve never emailed a game developer before). He responded right away and helped me get through my issue, which happened to just be me missing a step in the game process. My bad! I wanted to update this to 5 stars because every bit of this game and the developer deserve it. Keep it up Adam!!(This is my previous review, which I gave 4 stars) I love this game so far. The only thing (which I really hope the developer sees this) is I‚Äôm currently stuck in the crypts. Whenever I try to travel anywhere further it puts me right back in the crypts. I literally cannot continue the game because of this and I just spent $5 on it, so that‚Äôs annoying. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP. Hi!I got your e-mail as well and have replied to it. Short version is: You need to enter the chapel, and exit it on the other end, and then continue.I hope this helps, if not, send another e-mail and I'll help you out!/Adam "

If you‚Äôre thinking about playing this game or not for sure what game to play next, I highly consider playing this game, it‚Äôs really worth the money. When I first started playing this game it was ok, I was burning stuff earning money so I thought of it as the game that lighten me up when I bored (see what I did there lol anyway) but when I met sugar plumps there was a story I never knew about and it was awesome and then it went to the crisis I thought it was over and left on my iPad not even realizing it (mainly because I can't know anymore combos lol)but then after I got back on to it, it was almost to the end.

It's nice to have a game I can complete and feel satisfied with. I recommend to anyone who like point and click games. Hoping for a sequel! Hi crossfire2200, thanks for your feedback. Naturally the length of time people take to get through the story varies depending on how long it takes them to solve the puzzles, but we do acknowledge that the biggest criticism of the game people have stated is its length. We like to think that we went for quality over quantity, for example every line of dialogue is hand animated, something you wouldn't see in AAA video game let alone one developed by a very small indie studio like ourselves (it was pretty much a team of 4 of us that worked on this for 3 years). These kinds of games are actually very expensive to make, which is why you don‚Äôt typically see too many 3D point and click adventures games nowadays (beyond a very small handful of large developers such as Telltale like you mentioned). Anyway, felt I should reply to your review to answer your criticism, the hope is very much that if the game makes enough money that we will be able to create a second, longer sequel. Thank you.

But what makes it a great game is the feeling of something original and fun. It goes towards the very basics of turn based gaming and is a roam type game which makes it even better. I had this game on a different account which was level 128, and now I‚Äôm starting over cause I lost my old phone... but never mind that. If you‚Äôre looking for a great game look no further. U may see people complaining about the energy system or ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù but this is neither of those. It has the option to buy things in the game, but honestly they don‚Äôt really help you. More of just a boost for an hour or two. And the energy, a lot of games use this to keep players from becoming super good within the first 45 minutes. This is purely so you don‚Äôt get bored and delete the game. This is a super fun game I honestly would recommend it to anyone who likes classical games. And don‚Äôt worry, the game is just like the video, no ripoff there ü•¥ The featured review talks about how if there wasn‚Äôt an energy limit you could just grind easily and get a ton of familiars except artificially increasing the length of a game is the biggest pay to win gimmick ever. The game is lazily made. I don‚Äôt mind the game itself but everytime I try and get a familiar it fails unless you bribe it with super hard to get gems. It takes ridiculous amounts of items just to upgrade one rare piece of equipment. You have to watch adds to get the rare gear because it‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll even survive. Most of it is pay to win. There isn‚Äôt even a story! You could add a story that would take an hour to a week to write at most and essentially double the time without putting on an energy limit but that‚Äôs not going to happen because energy is how they make their money. The main way anyway. Oh, and the reason you have to grind for familiars is because of how rare they are even though they aren‚Äôt that useful they‚Äôre treated like gems and the game constantly rubs it in if you don‚Äôt have a full team of them. After the first two guaranteed familiars I completed the first map and guess what. I only got two familiar offers and they both failed when I tried to persuade them which by the way costs 1k gold and is rigged with a low success chance of about 40%. You can‚Äôt repeat levels, only dungeons and I never got another familiar offer from a repeated dungeon. It‚Äôs annoying, requires grinding, and get‚Äôs pretty boring when you add it all together. Let me fist start off by saying i really like the game The artwork The mechanics it all blends nice and well but what really makes this game frustratingly fun is the fact that you will find your self in pointless dungeon and grinding hours and hours just for a pice of loot or a ruin or other things you need to build up your character so he or her can become stronger and not die all the time like it happens to me but what‚Äôs really sad is the Energy is absolutely dreadful look I understand that the developers don‚Äôt want you wasting your time on a game but at the same time players like myself are really competitive and will stop at nothing until I achieve what ever my goal may be wither that be a ruin or a pice of armor you see what I‚Äôm saying I could go on about how much was promised but sooo little was given in return I really enjoy this game I do but it seems to me that the dungeons are really repetitive I almost feel bad for calling in other people to do my job for me I hope that both you there person that reads this and the developers that made this game takes the time to read this and get a little understanding of what people like have to deal with when it comes to bit hero‚Äôs so please all I ask of you developers is FIX YOUR GAME!!

I love how you can make your own truths and dares, choose between kid, teen and adult, and choose spin the bottle, random selection or auto turn mode!

I mean I know the ads can be annoying sometimes but it‚Äôs every free game not your fault. But I do have a tip to improve your rating. Just make the game a little more challenging and creative or even add some holiday features like  Christmas or Halloween and more (by the way Happy New Year üòõüòâ). But overall I adore this game and I think all the people who deleted the game and put bad reviews is mostly the ads but that‚Äôs what every free game does and hope they realize it. I recommend this game üëåüèªüëåüèªüî•üî• and hope you can improve to 5 star!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èEdit: Another tip I forgot is add music!! Thanks!! Although this is a really well animated app there are a lot of adds. If you are thinking about downloading this app you should because you might think differently, but at first when I started playing there were not that many but as I got further into the game there got to be more and more pop up adds. Also, you can collect these crystals on the way down but sometimes they are the same color as the obstacles so, if you are going fast it is hard to tell the difference. One positive I would give on this app is that the animations are awesome and you can tell they put a lot of work into the game. You can also customize so many things. Some people say that the phone vibrating effects the game, but I found that it made it more enjoyable. It is not so extravagant that it moves my hand personally, but it could affect others. Also you can turn the vibration off if it really bothers you so it is not much of a problem. Sometimes when playing I also die for no apparent reason. I will be completely clear of obstacles which was extremely frustrating. The one thing that would make this app WAY more enjoyable is if there were less adds. On my phone there are seriously 2-3 adds per round which adds up since the rounds can be pretty short. You can remove them for 3 dollars but I am one who does not like to spend money on apps. This is is fun!! Not going to lie but I feel like the part that makes it hard for some people is the fact that it vibrates every time you go through a vortex, this makes my hand shake causing me to dieüò§. I feel like they did this on purpose so you watch more adds (which is how they get their money). So, it‚Äôs really hard to go through small openings especially with the constant buzzing breaking your concentration. So, I would give this 5 stars, but the buzzing just ruins it. GREAT JOB VOODOO (I‚Äôm being sarcastic if you can‚Äôt tell). All I‚Äôm asking us for them to take the buzzing out so you can easily play the game. PLEASE!!!!!!! For the sake of people being able to keep their hand(s) steady while playing this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please don‚Äôt ignore my review Voodoo, I‚Äôm doing this so you can improve your game and make it more playable üòõüòõüòõ. However, I do like the different balls and vortex‚Äôs they have, it makes the game more interesting!!! ü§ó So, if you were thinking of getting this game, I wouldn‚Äôt tell you not too! It‚Äôs fun and amusing, just be aware it‚Äôs hard to keep your hand steady and could give you a headache (remember, it‚Äôs make your phone buzz). I hope that Voodoo fixes the buzzing issue and maybe I‚Äôll consider playing this game more üòùüòãüôÇüëçüèº "

It used to be good! It USED to not crash every five seconds even though I am playing on an iPad Mini 4! All my other games don‚Äôt crash on my new device. Whenever I just walk around, I end up battling something or whatever, and then after I finish it, it just crashes and deletes some of my progress. Very disappointed, as said in the title. I got stuck somewhere I had already gone to (because it‚Äôs kinda like a maze in the game world) and I was trying to go back, because instead of being in the Kelso Desert place or something I think I got stuck in Pearl Town and ended up going in circles and then getting stuck where I am now. One of the routes or something I don‚Äôt know. The game is very frustrating most of the time because I don‚Äôt know how or why all these spelling or grammar errors got into the game. And the most frustrating part? If you don‚Äôt remember to go to settings and save every five seconds it will delete your progress. I made this mistake several times and ended up losing all the dragons I caught. This is also how my Hydronite has gotten farther and farther away from evolving. So, just PLEASE fix this game! I am sorry if I sound demanding, I am just very annoyed! I continually have these same problems again and again, yet no update to fix them! This game is almost exactly like Pok√©mon! But you need some changes.... first change is ads which is the main one, even single time I defeat a animal thingy (forgot what it‚Äôs called sorry) there is a ad! And I get so annoyed! And Pok√©mon doesn‚Äôt have ads and that‚Äôs what makes it better then it already is! Which is saying something since it already is like, amazing! But this game is a whole another BAD level! So you need to maybe re release  the game and make it have no ads! Next tip is this... the copying. I know you got inspiration from Pok√©mon but that‚Äôs fine! What I‚Äôm saying is basically the starter Pok√©mon and story line of the game is the exact same! And we need some changes, maybe make the starter Pok√©mon more original? And also maybe release a second game of this but improved! With a new storyline, original starter Pok√©mon, different people, AND NO ADS! Third is the last and..... I already mentioned this but.... RLEASE A NEW GAME THAT HAS ALMOST NO BUGS, NEW THINGS, REMOVING THINGS, AND NO ADS! If you read all of this thank you! And if any of the developers read this: your game is amazing it‚Äôs just that I can‚Äôt go through this whole story with a billion ads going on! And that this is just criticism -cymphonique üíû "

Story is kinda generic, but not terrible. The one flaw I‚Äôm seeing so far is that the narrative subtitles tend to go by really fast, even if I‚Äôm not touching the screen. Makes it really hard to experience the story when the dialog subtitles whiz by at the speed of light, especially when there is no voice acting for 75% of the dialog. This game is decent at best in its current form could be way better. So far what I like is the combat I like real time more than turn based. The characters are pretty likable from I played so far I‚Äôm in CH3 in the story. That being said the voicing seems lack luster it started strong voicing almost everything then most of CH2 was barely voiced. There‚Äôs no timers for the recharge on stamina or pvp flags that‚Äôs a bit bothersome. I don‚Äôt quite like the pricing for draws either 750 seems a bit much for only getting 9 gems per stage I know it‚Äôll all add up but content will eventually run dry. PVP is auto based in a straight line just sit back and watch your team win as you get to pick who you face. Gacha seemed fairish? I got a character every 10 pull but they were 3 star I also didn‚Äôt check the rates so that‚Äôs kinda my fault. Gathering mats seems tedious that‚Äôs with most CR promoted games tho. Overall I‚Äôll give this game a chance but I won‚Äôt hold my breathe hopefully things change a little like the timer I mentioned earlier but it‚Äôs been 2 days I‚Äôm the first written review? I don‚Äôt think that holds too well for this game.Edit: There is no refill over time for stamina... so the only way to get more is by leveling up your account (Which feels like it takes for ever.) and buying stamina refills (Which is 25 gems per refill?)... this is a horrible business tactic It‚Äôs 2020 and we‚Äôre taking 20 steps back into poor decisions. The game is not bad. The characters and story are interesting and the graphics are decent. The main thing that I do not like is the combat. The battles require a lot of skill early on and you quickly hit walls. The real time action is nice, but there are many issues: Large enemy attacks are hard to dodge and happen too quickly, especially when there is several enemies and things to watch. Also, the camera follows the leader, meaning that you can lose track of your other characters and have to switch leaders to see what is happening with each character. While this isn‚Äôt too bad, I wish that the camera could be zoomed out. The controls are also not the best and can be unresponsive at times. The result of these issues combined is that a team of 100,000 battle rating can lose against a 60,000 battle rating stage.

More dialogs will be written in part of effort to more complete game experience! @Tony Peniyoung I was going to answer your concern but didn't really get the message! @Grievlocke Wow, having big battle animations will be really cool. Number 1 in my wish list too. Simply there was no budget and it looks like there will be no budget in the future, either- looking at the sales. @Many who wanted more stages I had random map generation for more guild quests, but I couldn't get the quality right yet. Random really never worked with the element of strategy, and became just a brute fighting. Partia 2 was planned for 25 stages that wraps up the story, but at 600 games sold, well, I wonder if I could ever get enough budget. @ErnieBernie876 I know it is not as convenient as having a restart button, but you could suspend the game and load the last save data to restart the stage from the beginning. @frozencracker It would be a bug if you have an attack option without having a valid target, but I can't seem to reproduce it. To cancel the attack while targeting, you could press 'B' button (that's the inside button) or you could choose a target then select No. I will try my best to answer any question!

Having an accuracy boost on the pathetically weak main character is especially welcome!- Big maps! Some might complain, about more tapping/clicking/turns to traverse, but big maps make battles feel epic!Cons:- Punishing EXP system (esp on expert). You will need to grind, especially with your main character, to get them strong enough to not get one shotted by enemy grunts Tips (for noobs only):- Exploit the arena. Revisiting town spawns new random arena match- Save your potions! Should be used in arena only- If you run out of potions for the arena, bring in your healer and do 2v2 matches vs. weak enemies to heal your injured units - For best EXP gains, it is most effective to unequip your character weapon and wait for a weak enemy to attack (and hopefully miss) for 25 turns, OR attack with slow/weak weapons.(Edit after response from Developers):Bumped up to 4 stars, since the punishing EXP system works as Devs intended! Hi, thanks for playing the game, in the expert mode! Despite the higher difficulty, I think it is how the game should be played, especially in Partia 2 and 3. There is a joy in bulldozing through the game to get to the end, but there's also a joy in bringing up your characters to see if they can meet the challenges the game throws at you. ;-) This would probably be my favorite original tactics game on iOS if it wasn't for the fact that I cannot pass Chapter 2 without losing characters. Partia is close to a perfect Fire Emblem copy, and I wish I could enjoy it fully, but I feel too much experience is needed to level, character stats are WAY too low (same with stat increases during level ups), and somehow my 80+% hit chance will miss twice, but a 30% hit chance will hit twice.At first I thought it was just bad luck, but after witnessing this happen on multiple occasions, I feel there must be some sort of imbalance.To put my frustration into an example I just experienced, my level 6 lord face to face with a level 4 hero in a duel could only do 2x2 damage with a steel sword with 61% chance of success and 13 health, died when he missed the level 4 hero twice, and the level 4 hero, with 11 health and 7 or 9x2 attack, landed a hit both times at 30 or so percent hit rate.I have had this game for ages, and I would deeply love to enjoy the full story and gameplay, but there seems to be some issues in this.Would give 5 stars, but I've been waiting for this to be fixed, I keep playing even though I know how imbalanced it is, and it will never get fixed. Partia is a strategy game that reaches its goal of being a pretty genuine clone of Fire Emblem for iOS- the best, imo. Gameplay is pretty solid, although horizontal style is pretty awkward since the d pad is really tiny and right under the game display screen, so 60% of the device's screen isn't really used. The story is okay, and, overall, Partia is a good game for a small fee. There thankfully isn't any IAP rubbish, and that could have fit in perfectly with this kind of game. Sadly, it lacks a tutorial, so I recommend everybody to look up a quick guide on how to play Fire Emblem before embarking on a quest with Partia so that you get the basics. The thing Partia really needs, though, is full screen for vertical play for 5G devices and up. Even if you just want to fill up those empty black corners with a cool Partia wallpaper, that would be enough to keep me satisfied. I was going to put four stars because of this minor issue, but i'll cut the dev some slack- I read that the dev consists of only two people working on this game which is pretty amazing: you have done a great job. Keep up the good work. "
‚ÄéAlmost a Hero - Idle Click RPG,"Almost A Hero is an idle RPG clicker game of epic proportions where some of the most useless dimwits embark on a quest to be slightly less useless. They say never give a loser an even chance. We say different. A bunch of deeply unique and deeply flawed individuals have been chosen for greatness. Heroic, noble, enlightened... Just 3 of the many words they can‚Äôt spell. Combine them seemingly cleverly to beat endless waves of enemies in multiple modes - find your own way of hoping to make good use of them only to be taught otherwise painfully. Join these zeroes on a quest to become heroes in an ancient land. Train them to learn battle skills, magical powers and which end of a sword is the business end. In Almost A Hero you‚Äôll find quests, secrets to unlock and there's lots of clicking to do. Yup, it‚Äôs a clicker game, an idle one. Have you nearly got what it takes to maybe, under certain circumstances, potentially become almost a hero? ‚ÄúI‚Äôd challenge you to a battle of wits but I see you came unarmed‚Äù - Wendle the Wise",https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/86/a4/31/86a43127-2eab-3c81-e906-68736efd567a/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png,"Upgrades, Battles, Heroes",4.8 ‚Ä¢ 12.6K Ratings,Free,,"October 2, 2020","The game is very good for what it is(an idle game for you check on while waiting in line at the store or while you sit upon the porcelain throne) the art is very good and the characters are unique for example one of the goblin hero‚Äôs items required to evolve him is a prosthetic leg despite him not being an amputee which is funny because it implies he stole someone‚Äôs prosthetic leg.the only issue I have had so far is that when watching ads for diamonds there is one ad that crashes the game(its an interactive ad for world war rising) and doesn‚Äôt reward you with diamond so if the devs read this I suggest you either stop running that ad or you look into what‚Äôs causing the issue to occur because it is very discouraging as the game runs the same ad if you close the game and try again the only way to get past this is to wait a few hours before trying to watch another ad (from a business standpoint it is critical that you fix this it is incredibly discouraging to watch ads when I know I might just be wasting my time) I have tried this on an iPhone 10, iPhone 6, and a friends Samsung tab 4. I was not able to get the ad to run on the iPhone 10 so I have no idea if this happens there to but the bug does read occur on Android(granted the tab 4 is very outdated so that might just be a device issue)In short awesome game minus the one bug. Highest level I‚Äôve achieved is 600. So I‚Äôve played this a rather fair amount. I‚Äôve played a ton of tap games. The concept is ideal for me. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I am forced spend a lot of time in an app, but knowing I can if I want to. I don‚Äôt want to feel like no progress is made in my short play sessions, so in and so forth. Tap games are my best friend. That being said, THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE!! The art style really sells this game. The characters have charm. They have purpose. You get attached to certain characters and really understand their strengths and weaknesses EASILY. The same cannot be said for other games in this genre. You end up with sprawling hordes of guys you don‚Äôt remember and you spend the time dumping resources into min/maxing a bunch of rando characters you don‚Äôt give a rip about. You certainly spend some time doing that in this one, but the 5-man team is PERFECT. It‚Äôs digestible, user-friendly, and you actually give a crud about your characters, leveling them up, working on their equipment. Brilliant. Great game. From one industry dude to another, kudos to the team that made this. I love rpgs and I love idle games, especially now that I‚Äôve seen the combination of the two. But this game has to be my favorite.So many things to upgrade, over a thousand levels, and multiple quest types. This game really has it all and I‚Äôm happy I get to enjoy watching simple side characters rise to greatness. I love all the characters especially Vexx‚Äôs quips and Lia‚Äôs design. The only problem I have is with Redroh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like most of what he has to offer like the ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy targets‚Äù combo. But I‚Äôve noticed that though he‚Äôs a treasure goblin, 6 of his skills affect gold, while 7 affect offense. I feel as though he could use a little touch up as I planned to keep him in my party. But spending his perks and items on ‚Äútrade secret‚Äù and ‚Äúconfusing presence‚Äù feels like a big waste. I‚Äôve even considered switching him out for Uno or another support characters, but I wanna like him. I hope you see this, and thank you for your time and game! "

I love this game, although I‚Äôm not sure what there actually is to do other than watch her do everyday activities. There is great potential here, if some interactions such as talking or playing games with her were added, it would definitely be an improvement. For example, when Luna has free time, what can you do with her other than change clothes/makeup? Edit: after playing a bit more, I have come to understand the ‚Äústory‚Äù, that she is a n AI who is learning how to behave (talk, do activities, etc.) so it makes sense she does not do much yet.

Well good news is, Square updated the game with a bug fix, which has now removed the crashing issue (which for clarification had it so battles with multiple of one enemy type upon defeat would cause a crash). Now I can write a proper review hurray! As a completable game it is reasonably worth it and much like an expanded edition of the first, which is responsive and does what it can for the original. As a remake (on the app store no less) I would objectively give it five stars but as it went so long without a big fix I give it four. Not that that matters much besides for the cover. Stars aside and to the real point, now that the game functions properly I can say it is a worthwhile game! Why are my reviews always so long When my Dragon Warrior I & II cartridge for my Game Boy stopped working shortly after finishing the first game, I was glad that I could play the second on my phone. This is a great game.The game itself is a classic. Although, among the DQ games its considered to be one of the worst, I found it quite enjoyable. The story is much more involved than the first one and the additional party members add to the experience.This version of the game is probably the best. The game is generally criticized for its difficulty, but with this version a lot of that has been fixed; the ‚Äòhidden‚Äô treasures sparkle, the prince and princess are pretty useful, there‚Äôs a world map, etc. I also liked the updated sprites and the additional save options.The one thing that I didn‚Äôt really like was the controls. Coming from the Game Boy, it took me a while to get used to the touch screen controls, but once I did, I did. And to be fair, there aren‚Äôt really any better options on a phone.Overall, it‚Äôs a great game, well worth the $5 imo It is fun, cheap way to enjoy childhood nostalgia, but the old carts and system would be a lot of money and time.... this I was able to enjoy it on the road. It has been changed... it is the same, but they nerfed the crap out of it, the save log allows you to save anytime (good for the road) but makes the game much easier... save every 5 steps or after every battle... also the level ‚Äúgrind‚Äù doesn‚Äôt feel as difficult or time consumingThe graphics are nice and updated, the games save feature is nice for on the road, and it is pretty much exactly like the original, although some names were changed.I gave it a 4 because it was great fun, but needs a classic mode that is just like the original... heck in today‚Äôs insta win game world it would be called ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù mode "

It is the only game I‚Äôve ever played that I have actively played daily since launch. During that time I‚Äôve seen a lot of improvements to this game, most positive.I disagree with pay to play. If you put in enough time, and do the right events, you hit a point where the game is giving you enough tokens (in game currency) and covers to keep yourself going. You can win new covers through gameplay or legendary covers that they hand out as you level your character. You get rewarded with new characters for leveling existing characters. Or for $10/month you can go VIP and get daily prizes.The reason I gave it 3 stars is as follows. The game needs to figure out what to do with extra covers. If you have a character that is not championed and you get a 6th cover in any one color, you have to get rid of it. This makes it very frustrating when you do not have enough iso to champion the character, or you have less than 13 covers in that character. I‚Äôve had many circumstances where I‚Äôve had to throw away a 4 or 5 Star card because I couldn‚Äôt use it. It‚Äôs enraging considering these are rare pulls. The ability to use these duplicate cards towards another color once you‚Äôve hit 5 covers in a single color would be great.There are also times when I have an issue with the game. Getting a generic response from customer service is not the best treatment of customers, especially when it doesn‚Äôt solve the issue. Thank you for taking the time to type a review! There have been lots of QoL changes since then that we hope you and every other player enjoy, but we're especially proud of this one: when it comes to extra covers, we now have a system called ""Saved Covers"" which allow you to protect your covers from expiration, and build up the excess covers to level up its corresponding character's abilities in the color of your choice.

(Day 1584) Like any game things are easier when you pay. But that‚Äôs mainly in the beginning. And that‚Äôs only if you want to progress faster or challenge other well-established players and teams. If you just want to play events and collect covers, you can. You can select the difficulty level for an event even one below your current ranking, if that‚Äôs what you need.I‚Äôm at a point or I can get the 4-star cover progression reward for almost every event. I still can‚Äôt effectively challenge the top teams in PVP, I but that‚Äôs OK since it‚Äôs not necessary for the game (or me). It‚Äôs one of the few games that I felt the need less and less to pay to play the longer I played. Of course at first it took patience and perseverance and the need to resist the desire to have to progress to the top so quickly.I‚Äôm glad there are events that are pretty easy and those that are very hard, so it‚Äôs not too discouraging nor boring. I‚Äôm still experimenting with different combinations of players and teams. I will admit that like many it seems like the AI cheats, because he gets so many more combinations of matches than I ever do. (I call the AI ‚ÄúSir Hacksalot‚Äù.) But most of the time I am a way stronger team than his so I can forgive it. Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. We take customer feedback very seriously, and will discuss this with the rest of the team so they understand your opinions on this matter.If you require any support for the game, you can contact the Customer Support team using the following link:mpqsupport@d3go.com I love this game, I really do. The problem is that I can‚Äôt win any battle except for the beginning story battles of which I have completed a long time ago. The A.I. is way too powerful. It can obtain special moves and chains almost instantly while it takes me forever to get one special move. I am also getting pitted against way more powerful players/characters who win every single time. I can‚Äôt upgrade my characters because I can‚Äôt obtain any hero vault tokens. I can‚Äôt keep any characters I like because when I get a new higher tier character, I have to either delete a character I already have or I have to buy a new slot with hero tokens which are very hard to get unless you buy them. The A.I. also does 10x more damage than me and it has extremely long chains. I can‚Äôt advance at all unless I play for weeks and weeks or I spend $20. This is ridiculous. Fix the upgrade system and make the game easier to play, and don‚Äôt make the A.I. cheat when it‚Äôs losing because that happens often. As of right now I don‚Äôt recommend this game to anyone until adjustments are made!üò° "

It wasn‚Äôt like those games that ruins the first on. But one thing that they should try making better is the graphics, but they will not ruin the game for me. Normally I‚Äôm not the one who would complain about the graphics, but these where a understatement. Sometimes you wouldn‚Äôt even see the person but hear the talking, or the mouth would move but the chin would. And moving around, my goodness, they way that had it set up in the first one was amazing, with the joystick. But this one you have to tap where you want to make, it make it very difficult to play. Also the game just randomly crashes. And I would blame my iPad but my iPad is new and up to date. But otherwise the game is super super good and if have played the first one, you have to play this one!!! While I love the story, there are significant bugs which prevent me from giving this 5 stars. First, characters are frequently in the wrong locations during cutscenes and conversations, a dragonkin figure is not properly displayed, and David‚Ä¶ his jaw movements in episode 1 made him even scarier than he is. Then there‚Äôs the control scheme. I liked the scheme from the first Life is Strange, where one half of the screen controls the player character while the other half controls the camera, but you don‚Äôt have that option here. Tap to walk somewhere. If you miss the tap target to interact with something, you end up starting to walk away from it, which quickly got annoying. And I didn‚Äôt get far into episode 3 before it got crashier than I would have liked. Anyway, story gets 5 stars, but the lack of control scheme options, crashes, and bugs drop the overall rating to 3 stars. I loved the original Life Is Strange. With so many characters and settings, it was hard to get mad over the glitches. (Which there were very FEW of.) But this... This ruins the Life Is Strange feeling. The feeling I get from playing Life Is Strange is wonder. Like telltale games, I constantly wonder what is going to happen next. But with so many errors and mistakes in this game, it makes it hard to ignore them. Like with one section where David‚Äôs lips don‚Äôt move, yet his jaw moves up and down when he is speaking, and his skin glitches into his eyes! And when I‚Äôm in the car with William, It kicks me out of the game when he‚Äôs hit by the semi truck. This is not the Life is Strange I fell in love with, and I honesty regret buying this... I wasted 12 bucks on a game that doesn‚Äôt even work. Like in the title, this game had good potential, but sadly, it didn‚Äôt live up to my standards. If your like me, and read the reviews before getting a game, do what you want. But if you have a iPad Pro, I suggest don‚Äôt buy this game. Requires iOS 9.0 or later.

‚ÄéHyperRogue,"You are a lone adventurer in a strange, non-Euclidean world. Gather as much treasure as you can before the nasty monsters get you. Explore about 50 different lands, each with its own unique treasures, enemies, terrain obstacles, and mechanics which challenge your tactical and navigation skills. Your quest is to find the legendary treasure, the Orbs of Yendor. Collect one of them to win! Or just ignore your quest and collect smaller treasures. The twist is the unique, unusual geometry of the world: it is one of just few games which takes place on the hyperbolic plane. Witness a grid composed of hexagons and heptagons, straight lines which seem to be parallel, but then they diverge and never cross, triangles whose angles add up to less than 180 degrees, how extremely unlikely is it to reach the same place twice, and how the world seems to be rotated when you do return. All this matters for the gameplay. The game is inspired by the roguelike genre (although in a very minimalist way), works of M. C. Escher, and by puzzle games such as Deadly Rooms of Death.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/a6/7f/8b/a67f8b4d-3afa-4483-02dd-0af75993fb48/AppIcon-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-9.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.1 ‚Ä¢ 22 Ratings,$2.99,,"April 6, 2020","Thanks for the review! As in the desktop versions, the game should be saved if you exit the app after picking up an Orb of Safety (while it is still active). Orb of Safety should be easy to find in the Land of Eternal Motion and Crossroads (after you pick up 10 Phoenix Feathers in LoEM), and also in the Prairie. Unfortunately a save feature available at any time is very difficult to add because of the structure of the world. A maze land would be cool, it would have to work with certain geometry‚Äôs and certain algorithms. Maybe it could point to the direction of the center, and when you got there, you get a ton of rare loot! And cheese which can be used as bait. The game is good, but it‚Äôs impossible to play as it because it constantly crashes, and restarts you back at the beginning when you reopen.

I was one of the few that bought PSII as a standalone app many, many moons ago. To have III & IV make a triumvirate is certainly awesome. But this is exactly what complicates the relationship between players and developers that bundle their works. Maybe we want one game without the others. Maybe we‚Äôre glad to have all this rare stuff in a nice little box. Newbies will love the price, but we who have already invested at least SOMETHING into this (US$2.99, I think it was) now need to invest just a little more. All told, it‚Äôs going to be about $8 for me, and that leaves a sour taste in the mouth, if you get where I am going.  Make the pricing less vague and split ‚Äòem up. Let Apple bundle things for you. They‚Äôre all good games. It‚Äôs a shame the series did not develop further as standalone console RPGs. Still a good buy and worth the pickup. This has been the best download for me during quarantine and great to relive the best of all RPG games... I completed IV and III and currently working on II. For anyone with issues on saving for PSII the trick is to save the game in the data center in the actual video game, and NOT use the top right hand save button that the app gives you... I was using the top right button at first which makes you wait the 30 seconds every time you do so and midway through the game it would freeze and stop working and reboot. I was devastated thinking I couldn‚Äôt continue this complex game without save but I tested and went to a data center in the actual game located in the town (the logo outside the building looks almost like a division sign with dot and lines)... save in the slot there and then once you exit and restart the game you can access it that way by clicking start when PSII comes up. IT WORKS and is better and faster than the app button which is faulty anyway. And when you are further into PSII and have Shir the thief steal the visaphone from the headquarters in Paseo once she is at level 10, this device lets you save ANYWHERE and at any point in the game and yes, it works!! You can thank me later!! Enjoy your playing! This app has brought back so many great memories of the late 80s and early 90s for me. Totally worth it for free but I would‚Äôve paid. It's hard to believe this game came out in 1989! Back then it was the largest cartridge game ever but memory was still a limitation so it came with a 100 page manual with maps, hints, descriptions of weapons, techniques, etc. The iOS port is pretty much an exact replica so I recommend finding that info on the web (unless you like frustration!) One cool addition is the cloud save feature which literally lets you save your game anywhere! I even saved the game during the closing credits! It's a good thing too as the regular 'data save' feature quit working about halfway through.  The most annoying thing was the control buttons blocking large portions of the screen. I didn't find out until my last day playing that you could adjust the opacity! Oh well... Another bug I found: whenever I tried to use the Neisword to return to Lutz, the game froze and I had to exit and restart from my last save. (I am on an iPad with 10.3.3). I just used Hinas to get back so it wasn't a big deal. Five stars to Sega for allowing me to relive a small portion of my youth! One more thing, I paid to remove the ads and there was only one Sega ad that would pop up when you first start the game. Not as annoying as the reviews led me to believe. "

Then it‚Äôs off to grinding / pay to play. I really wanted to love this game. Started off well balanced, lots of quests, activities, great designing of stages and characters. UNTIL players hit lvl 40. Grind grind grind. To get lvl3 gems, players had to farm 10 puzzle pcs. Each puzzle pcs drop 5-6 td stages. Need 4 gems to break chain and on to next lvl (multiple lvls per hero). That‚Äôs for only ONE HERO. *It limits players to try other awesome heroes. To gain tickets for farming material is to pay to play. Or players will soon run out of tickets even with questing or earning from achievements. Stages are also lvl capped, therefore, force the players to PLAY the SAME stages HUNDREDS OF TIMES!!! It gets boring after a while... beginning is fine to play without paying. But the platform forces players to pay to get more powerful. I spent $1 to see where it gets me, not far. I do purchase on other games but this is too soon and too much. Might delete the game in couple of weeks. TOO MUCH GRINDING AND TOO LITTLE REWARD.

I am missing 1,200 gold ingots and lost about 400 morale due to this update and it is proving almost impossible to speak to anyone about it. The game is excellent besides my personal problem. Please it it a try!Theory As a player that never spent anything on iap, this game was reasonable in letting free players progress. Sure it was slower, but that's how these games are. But there will be a paywall later on, where specific OP and essential generals have to be bought with money (the healer one can revive a general and his army, the tank one debuffs all attackers' speed by 80%, those two will often single handedly win the battle). If you dont have them, you will never get past 1700ish pvp rating, and pvp is the only endgame progression where you can get 5 star gear and beyond. The other problem is that they are really slow with content updates. The main content in this type of game are the new generals, or reworks of previously useless/irrelevant ones to become decent or even essential. But those updates were usually about once every 6-8 months, and usually there would only be 1-2 good ones, with the rest being fodder/not viable in meta. Eventually you will get a feel for the 20+ ones you gotta include in every formation, and after that it becomes really repetitive. At endgame it takes about 2 hrs a day to keep up with regen/currecies and other stuff. Eventually it's more of a chore than fun I enjoyed playing the game a lot when there was English, but now it is all in Chinese. Where is the change language option that is mentioned in the updates?Would give five stars, but unfortunately can not find the language option. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

The characters r classic, of course, and each feel very unique.  The various game modes, for the most part, r very fun.  Also, it is comfortably possible to obtain even higher rarity characters over time.  So, again, play this game.1 complaint:  one of the game modes is the Arena, where u play against actual players in real time.  Usually during battle there is an option to speed up gameplay to double speed, quickening the game.  In the arena though, there is no option for this.  This, along with some players taking a great deal of time choosing a move, when the animations happen they occur in the slowest possible manner.  Some of my Arena battles have lasted upwards of ten minutes due to the slow nature of the animation.  Its so bad my trick is to pick for your team your lowest level characters, set the match on auto, and go make dinner.  I have done that to come back to the match still on!  Very broken, very not fun.I want to finally state that, aside from this complaint, all the rest of the content I have explored here has been very entertaining! I love the turn based style gameplay with all of my favorite characters. I love how frequent it seems that more characters are being introduced, the game isn‚Äôt lacking in content at all. Unfortunately it is EXTREMELY hard to play as a free to play player since so much of the progression mechanics rely on chance, unless you pay. The game isn‚Äôt quite pay to win, but it definitely has a pay to win feel since dropping large amount of money will allow you to max out your characters faster to make a stronger team. I also hate how pricey the bundles are. Everything is over $10 and some even go up to $100. I‚Äôve been tempted to buy, but can‚Äôt justify spending $30 on a few characters for a mobile game. If there were a few more packs and bundles for less than $10 maybe I‚Äôd make more purchases. It‚Äôs easier to spend smaller amounts more often than a large amount at once. My last issue is a technical one. After upgrading to the iPhone 11 max, I can no longer see who is next in the line up down in the bottom left of the UI. Before I could see like the next 3 or 4 characters to help strategize who I was going to go after, but now I have to just guess by the little yellow speed bars over the characters. I so want this game to have 5 star rating because I love the gameplay, I just don‚Äôt get to play the game as much as I would like to because of the time restrictions I face as a free to play player. I think this game has a lot of potential to be great, but it‚Äôs merely a cash grab for Disney. They make it nearly impossible to gain new characters and it‚Äôs so hard to tier up your already existing characters. The character tokens, which are used to unlock characters and level up your existing characters, are not even guaranteed after you win the battle. And leveling up yourself is fairly difficult. You get going really fast at the beginning but once you hit like level 9-10 it‚Äôs like a brick wall. You‚Äôre stuck constantly losing against higher leveled characters, and if u want to level up to beat them you have to replay multiple old levels. You have your starter characters which luckily they‚Äôre diverse enough ranging from the little mermaid to monsters inc, but after you get like the first low go characters, it takes forever or money to get enough tokens to unlock new characters. Then you finally have the chance to get character tokens in the special events, but oops, turns out you don‚Äôt have enough two star characters so you can‚Äôt play past level one. This game is designed to make people so frustrated at the stagnant-ness that they finally just say fine here‚Äôs my money, just to tier one character up. Honestly not really worth it IMO. I was excited at first bc it was going kind of fast, but like I said, you hit that brick wall and it gets really annoying and repetitive.

What they discover there changes their understanding of the world and their place in it, for better or worse.     Full voice acting, featuring Logan Cunningham (the voice of Bastion) as Horatio. -- Reviews -- Adventure Gamers - ""Beautiful, surrealistic retro graphics; likeable characters and a deceptively sprawling plot."" 4/5 Eurogamer - ""Primordia is delightful, smart and packed with personality."" 7/10 Rock Paper Shotgun - ""A cast of thoroughly insane-in-the-short-circuited-membrane side characters keeps the ride nice and lively as well, complimenting the oppressively dreary setting with a strong mix of mystery driven drama, Old West frontier charm, and dark humor.""

Add to this no less than two disparate Messianic visions and your basic dystopic bargain, and you‚Äôve got a lot to reflect on by game‚Äôs end. The game mechanics are well planned too. While it is always possible to get to a good ending and a bad ending, choices made along throughout the game will determine whether you can get the best ending and the worst ending.  and puzzles drive most of the action, This game is amazing! The music ,art style , and voice acting mesh perfectly together to envelop you in the world if primordia. The somber tone and story elements reminded me a touch of blade runner. I defiantly recommend downloading it. My one critisim is that the controls are not immediately available they appear when you hover over a certain part of the screen you don't get a menu until you find your data pouch ,but I suppose that was intentional to give focus to the landscape of the scene. Overall great game 5 minutes into the game, and I already knew that I was in love. Crispin, your helper, is perfectly witty, and Horatio NullBuilt Version V, was intelligent and a deep character. Right away I was in love with the art, with the curiosity, and I could not bring myself to put the game down. It brought out so much raw emotion in me, and I fell in love over and over again. It was so worth buying, that words can't even begin to explain. The only issue is that it's impossible to get one achievement, but compared the wonder and joy I felt, that's nothing. "

It combines old fashioned turn based combat with new ""On the go"" technology that you can play anywhere! The story is flawless and I found myself falling in love with Cynthia. The character depth is amazing and I really felt their emotions.  I would pay anything for a sequel! Overall fun app. Haven't beat it yet working my way through to the overlords keep now.  Will say the touch controls could use better auto tracking but the on the fly controller switching in tight spots makes up for any tap to move issues.  Overall sound and story wins over this minor gameplay issue.  I will say a few things, the double confirm for sales is a bit stale and there is a scroll glitch in the special points shop but its nothing major as you will use shops maybe at most 8 times for weapons and armor and just max stack healing items once or twice.  The game has great difficulty in the beginning up towards mid game then with a few skills and the right orbs its easy to pull off massive damage at a huge risk in damage intake. Pretty balanced overall especially since getting closer to the overlord results in boss battles that need careful planning since super skills damage is no longer as effective with double damage setups.

This was something that could be overcome by slogging through all the enemies before each boss attempt, effectively farming gold. However, at the end of the game there's a boss-rush, making the randomness compound, along with all units being maxed by that point. It feels so sad to delete this game after playing through everything but the very last bit, but this is just too frustrating to try again. Still, the rest of the game was enjoyable. I love Match 3 games (this one is a ""slide the row or column,"" rather than a ""swap the blocks"" style game) and this one has a great game lurking under a picky performance.  The art work is wonderful, the idea of tower defense is fine...but the controls are so picky.  I wish the matches ""clicked"" into place a little bit.  Instead, I find myself moving the tiles and having them be, ooooh, just a little too far right, now just a little too far left, oops, a little too far right...it's very frustrating.  If the developers could adjust this a bit, I think the game would be greatly improved.  It would also be nice to be able to move blocks while the blocks are settling into place...I find myself waiting too much to make a move. "

The story is delivered in a procedural and modular fashion, making it very replayable.Resource management is simple (handled with dice) but adds the right mix of complexity and challenge. Your choices ‚Äî what you can do in the story sections, and which goals to pursue on the map ‚Äî are dependent on having capital to spend in any of five resource categories (war, diplomacy, wisdom, exploration, and spying).This is a unique and highly polished game, well worth the asking price. It has strong King of Dragon Pass energy but carves its own path. Give it a chance! Easy to pick up and start but deep enough to keep you playing for a long while. There are lots of ways to approach different events with surprising and interesting results. I didn‚Äôt expect much when I downloaded this; it was a real pleasant surprise. If you like games where you make choices that matter, and where there are several valid ways to approach different challenges, don‚Äôt miss this one. The game is written beautifully and is very reminiscent of a D&D type experience. Yet it involves the story of a kingdom rather than just a singular character. All choices have an extremely interesting effect on the rest of the game. I don‚Äôt know if anything can really be added, but am very excited to see more content. "

It is a great puzzler! It gets more challenging after each level. And no, it doesn't give you instructions which I like because you need to really think for yourself to solve the level. I don't normally write reviews and especially, a negative one but, it's a waste of money, even if it's 99c and I already deleted the game... At the very first level, one minute into the game am unable to bypass some silly meaningless not engaging or thought provoking challenge (jump over some silly canyon) and... every single time I 'fail' I get a message asking me to 'start a game from start' or 'load saved game' and each single time I have to select the option. The game might be beautiful (from the developer pictures and the video) but, whoever came up the idea of having those options popping up each time you can't bypass a so called challenge?

And though the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man by the name of Zack and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of a great collapse.

The music is catchy, battles are addictive. Story is sorta generic but funny. Only negative is the translation. Not a good job at all. Very awkward sentences and some that make no sense.

Although this game has autoplay, it is easily turned off, and it usually only reactivates itself for very short quests (I would prefer that it never activated though). It‚Äôs usually pretty simple to navigate without auto on, but I find it odd that distance arrows appear while on auto, but not on manual control (obviously they‚Äôd be far more useful in the latter-I‚Äôm pretty sure the AI doesn‚Äôt need the arrows). One small issue I‚Äôve noticed is frequent differences between spoken dialogue and subtitles. It can be quite confusing at times.A far larger issue to me concerns customization: there are costumes, but they don‚Äôt fully address my main issue, which is hairstyles. There are no hairstyle options while customizing your character, and all of the hairstyles available to purchase currently are tied to their respective costumes. Also, all of the hairstyles for female characters are quite long. I‚Äôd like for my female character to have short hair, but right now that‚Äôs not an option unfortunately.Other than the customization complaint-I‚Äôm really enjoying the game so far (and I really hope the dev will consider bringing the autoplay options in this game to their other games *cough* Novoland *cough*). I absolutely love this game. It‚Äôs really cool, the graphics are good, the quests are just hard enough so that it can be challenging but not so hard that you want to rage quit. I like all of the dungeons especially and all of the bosses you fight there. My only complaint is how hard it is to get new pets and mounts without buying them. If you want a free pet, you have to do a dungeon or a special event. Those are pretty fun, but for me at least it has been really hard to get a pet. I have done way over 100 dungeons and/or special events and I have only gotten one pet, not to mention a mount. And if you want to get mounts, you have to do the same things to get a pet, only with a much smaller chance of an already really small chance. Or, you can do the clan things and get those gold circle crown coin things, (I don‚Äôt know what they are called sorry,) and those take forever to get. I would just like there to be a easier and/or cheaper way to get pets and mounts. I think it would make a lot of players including me a lot happier. The only easy free mount I can think of were the golden night owl and dark moon lion. And the dark moon lion does not even stay with you forever. The easiest mount to get besides that would probably be the arcane broom, and that still takes some saving up. But overall, this game is freaking AWESOME and if you haven‚Äôt played it already DOWNLOAD IT NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING FUN THINGS ARE IN THIS APP ITS AN AMAZING GAME :D I‚Äôve Been playing in the memo RPG‚Äôs for a very long time the longest one I had played was World of Warcraft and since that I‚Äôve not found a game that I could sink my teeth into and invest time this game has everything I could ask for and I can play on my phone tablet and PC if I use An emulator. I‚Äôve been streaming this every day at the time of this post I had to have been playing for two weeks solid daily. I‚Äôve also been streaming it every day on Twitch the only thing I don‚Äôt like about the game up to this point is that I have to rely on certain guild events to get the stars to unlock the dragon mount. You essentially have a certain amount of time calculated within days and hours and you must complete that all the objectives within that time or you don‚Äôt get them out the three missions that I can‚Äôt do our guild related and my guild doesn‚Äôt seem to want to respond on running those types of missions to get them out so I understand some out being dungeon drop rate dropped and stuff like that but reliant on being a guild specific event I don‚Äôt agree with and that would be my only drawback to the gameOtherwise character creation and variety are plenty and there‚Äôs plenty of stuff to do in this game without buying a single thing.

I feel very powerful every time I hunt down a predator, I feel especially powerful when my clan helps me. It's also pretty cool to be the leader of the clan. The wisdom cat in Clan Of Cats helped me very much. At first I was waiting for like half an hour for my cat clan to help me defeat the boss in a cave.

I recommend downloading this game because it‚Äôs cool but the only conflict is you can‚Äôt play without internet and that‚Äôs what breaks my heart:/üò≠ so while you have internet I recommend playing it I also like this game because it loads soo fast unlike other when you have to wait 50 million years ( lol exaggeration) so that is why I gave this game 4 üåüüåüüåüüåü because I just didn‚Äôt like how you have to have internet to play the game. but over all it‚Äôs a happy game and if your reading this please get it!!!!:) I installed because I thought it would similar to Sims FreePlay. The graphics are kind of terrible. First there‚Äôs no way to zoom in or out, no way to change angles so you‚Äôre constantly bumping into and trying find your way. I had to skip each task because of that. Secondly it‚Äôs hard to drive if you get stuck against something you can‚Äôt back up and reverse. You can only drive forward and use the brakes. It‚Äôs really frustrating. I also forgot to mention the fact that it does not show you how to put an object down. I tried to drive the kids to school with a tray in my hand. Please fix all these issues. (: I‚Äôll consider reinstalling. Here are some suggestions let us design our characters and the mom. So it‚Äôs more realistic. Also we should be able to decide how many kids we want to have, what gender and age. Another thing you should add is if the mother could be pregnant and also decide if it‚Äôs a singular or multiples, the gender(s), the date of birth. This game would be more fun if had all those things. üôÇ Thanks for reading my review and listening to my suggestions I love your games but I have a few requests that y'all should put in the next update please make the babies üë∂üèΩ look even better than what they look like now they look super ugly and they have fat heads please make them look like real babies and can you please make the mom have the ability to pick up the cat and stuff and please make a free play so that by the next update I see all of my requests and we should also be able to be the other family members and the cat too please make sure that you don‚Äôt forget to put all of my requests on you‚Äôre next update so that others that play this game can enjoy it.

I feel it helps you out fairly well along the story and isnt fully p2p. I find myself using different units in different situations and there are no ‚Äúmust have or you cant compete‚Äù. Can be casual or intense just depends on how much you want to put it.Ps found best way to make in game currency is to sell runes and run the dungeon. Gems early complete the paths (also helps with scrolls and upgrades) My only complaint is endgame gets brutal when you start to run out of acomplishments. Its basically impossible to get 5 star units without paying real cash. For example I was underwhelmed when I beat every story mode level and difficulty and got a crappy scroll and a few gems. Or finishing the 100th floor of normal tower and not getting a guaranteed 5 star... I mean common. But enough complaining, I do enjoy this one and you will to!!! I am really enjoying this game. I love tactical type games and this one fits the bill perfectly.  I already  got two 5star drops from the normal gem currency you can accumulate thru gameplay. I haven‚Äôt spent a dime yet, but I‚Äôm going to throw some loot their way, great game so far... loving it.        Edit: After playing for awhile the drop rates are hideous, I think I was extremely lucky in the beginning. After my last multiple pulls on gems you only get the one 4star hero, but you are guaranteed that one anyway. I have yet to see a 4 or 5 star pull on the red crystals. Always 3star. The amount of pulls you would need to power up a hero to full and get them to 6 star are crazy. But there are multiple people in the arena with three or four fully powered hero‚Äôs, needless to say you can‚Äôt win against them at all. I still think the game is fun, but if you want to be able to go toe to toe with higher ups in arena, be prepared to fork over hundreds of dollars to maybe get close to where they are at. Maybe a thousand or two. It‚Äôs crazy. Artwork and gameplay doesn‚Äôt match. If that was even a bit closer I‚Äôd have to say this game would be a keeper. Another thing is segregating dark/light units from the rest of the gacha was a stupid move imo. It‚Äôs forcing your small player base into getting fire/water/wood units. Shouldn‚Äôt be that way. Rewards make you feel like you‚Äôre getting somewhere but you‚Äôre not. 1-3 gems a reward and it‚Äôs 300 to do a full 10x summon. I‚Äôve done about 4 summons and not a single 5* from that. Should tell you something and my only 5* was a free ticket they give you but the tickets only allow fire/water/wood units. It‚Äôs a really easy game to learn, interface is nice and simple, tactics level is amateur/intermediate. All I can see is this being a cash grab game and quickly off the market for a remake. They‚Äôll switch things up and release it under another title. Also after I did my first initial review which disappeared my game also stopped working and my account doesn‚Äôt exist (linked both to my Apple acc and my FB acc)... lol. Cool. So from a 2* I‚Äôm dropping a 1*. I‚Äôm using an iPhone 11 Pro Max. Should be zero issues. "

I've read every single choice of games book on the App Store, (except for that one about being an iron atom. I mean, what?) and this is most definitely the best one I've had the pleasure of ""playing"" coming in atop my former favorites, tin star and the heroes rise trilogy. This book delivered. I felt for the characters. I wanted to be there to comfort hatch, or lay a friendly hand on the ronin's shoulder when he was feeling overwhelmed. I enjoyed the dichotomy between the first book, which focused more on violence and swordplay, and this one, more attuned to the intellectual pursuits available in hyuga. Also, the last supper, Mona Lisa, and roof of the cistine chapel inclusions were much appreciated. I truly cannot wait until the third installment. I liked the emphasis on the character interactions, the depth one can see play out without needing the action to carry the plot along. I can respect that. The feel for established characters was there, the conflict and tension rising from the start and middle were great... Then it just took a turn for the strange that outright derailed it. One minute it is clear cut, next minute it's referencing something akin to inception in absurd ways that I felt hurt the story. I didn't enjoy the second half of the story due to how it went from character building, to questioning the characters roles in the story altogether, to a completely different story entirely that only referenced what was the original story. I loved the first Samurai of Hyuuga book, and I've replayed it many times. This book just felt like it was dragging its feet halfway through, tripped, and crawled towards the end with parallels to fantasy island as its crutch. Maybe I grew too fond to the flow of the previous books plot, but this felt hollow by the finish. I‚Äôve never cared to write a review before but... the tone and writing is as good as the first. However it feels as if we are restricted to the choices we‚Äôve made based on our stats. Now each choice isn‚Äôt clear in which your atunement is raised or lowered. It kind of bugged me as I wanted to diversify my character from book one, it was a bit frustrating having want to open up to my motley crew but feeling as if i wasnt supposed to. As character development is something every story should have.Now i dont really agree with other criticisms when we move onto the island. I feel like it‚Äôs a welcome addition, there are supposed to be supernatural elements that tug and mislead your path as the oni of greed tried to do in the first. I think if you really liked the first book definitely consider reading this one. I was only annoyed with the atunement stats, and that I had to take to google for a particular segment (one involving a japanese board game). This book is all about the aftermath after a storm with an exciting beginning and another storm brewing towards the end. Im hoping book 3 holds up considering the positive reviews. Definite props to the author. "

At first I was skeptical about downloading the app because there are so many interactive stories out there now and I‚Äôve downloaded almost all of them, so I can honestly say that this app has by far been my utmost favorite! Other apps make you wait a certain amount of time until you have more ‚Äútickets‚Äù to read, so when I saw they have a star tree that lets you gather more quickly and that they give you access to one story per day, to read for up to 4 days for free, I almost had a heart attack! I hate waiting in anticipation to gather up enough tickets (or in this apps case, Stars) in order to continue the story line, so this app has been like a dream for me! As long as I get access to one story a day and then use my stars for another I‚Äôm all set! Of course everyone loves animations, but I am content with the little breathing animations they give the characters that make them breath off the page. Anything more than that and I feel like I‚Äôd rather just watch an anime at that point. Anyway, sorry for the long review but I just couldn‚Äôt hold back how happy I was about the quality of this app and I needed to share! Wish the app makers would consider their readers value more seriously!!! The choices that cost gems for one are extremely high costing and not to mention within one single chapter the amount of times they want you to make that costly choice is ridiculous then on top of it clothing and hair that‚Äôs very high priced ...30 gems??? That‚Äôs straight ridiculous. The free choice of clothing is always something stupid like baggy sweats or overalls or baggy dirty clothing but yet in the story they will claim it‚Äôs a dress it‚Äôs stupid if the story says a dress then make the clothing fit the description and that stuff should be free seeing how it‚Äôs wrote about! The visual should match the description or else what‚Äôs the dang point?? We want attractive characters and to see what the story is saying so it makes sense!! Not to mention we barely get any videos an with it one single gem when everything is always like 17-30 gems!!! To even purchase gems you would need more than $100 to be able to choose the choices you want per chapter! Now that‚Äôs ridiculous and highway robbery these people only seem to care about taking money from people I swear then they don‚Äôt have many decent ways for you to earn things they also need to speed up the stars tree cause that‚Äôs also ridiculous! If you want a better app check out chapters they give way more free gems and multiple per video and have many other ways to earn gems and have better free stuff The other day I wrote a great long review on this app/game. I gave the reasons I loved the app and then rated it on different scales ect so I won‚Äôt go into detail on that again. However, I wasn‚Äôt sure where I could write this small complaint so here I am again. There is a slot machine game within the app and when you play the slots you pay 10 diamonds each time in hopes of winning large amounts of diamonds or various others wins. As for me I played this many times and have spent tons and tons of diamonds trying to win characters, diamonds ect. Anyway 3 times now I‚Äôve played the slots and won 100 diamonds each. I was unber excited however my winnings never showed or came to me in my diamond bank. This is very disappointing due to the fact I love the game and I love the slot machine concept. Though I‚Äôm sure you can imagine how frustrating this is to spend real money on diamonds, play the game win and not get your winnings. That‚Äôs 300 diamonds Worth that I‚Äôve lost out on. Among the many dollars I‚Äôve spent on this game buying diamonds to play with. Not to mention the hours of playing and getting daily wins ect.This will not stop me from playing the game however it will stop me from playing the slots game and spending unnecessary money on the app. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è "

It is designed in such a way that anybody can play it. And less you want to you don‚Äôt necessarily need to pay anything to play it. It‚Äôs very interesting even addictive. Myself I am not usually one to play mobile games. But this one is definitely worth at least trying. I guarantee you once you start playing it you will not stop. It‚Äôs just a pity there‚Äôs not more games like this out there. The only other game that I found that even compares to this one is called battle cry world of war incidentally also made by the same people. By FAR the greatest mobile game/game in general ever created hands down... Been here for about 5 years and I will never chose another game over this game! Hard to get started if you‚Äôre new. But if you seek help and figure it out, it‚Äôs one of the most complex and addicting games I‚Äôve ever seen in my life!!

I rate this game a 1 star because they don‚Äôt have no reporting option on the game to report trolls and their developer have blocked my account from comment on wall feeds for self defense my self I will update the 1 star to 5 star when they make a report option and do something about the trolls and bully‚Äôs etc and unblock my account so I can comment and don‚Äôt download the game because their  support team will not believe you they only believe the trolls and when you email them they will make lies up and close your ticket out and they will not unrestricted your account or unbanned it or give you a refund unleast you fill out a refund request from Apple or your card company and I have send them proof of the users started on me first and I self defense my self but they did not want to believe me and I also reported them by email but they closed my ticket out before they responded to it ! The blocking don‚Äôt work because they will send more users after you to troll you the developers support the trolls and you will get banned or muted if you self defense your self to the trolls! "

DQ 4-6 are a trilogy and look and play exactly the same, so you should get all 3. There is only 1 problem with Dragon Quest 6 and it‚Äôs that the game never tells you what to do next. Add in the fact that you have to constantly switch between 2 different worlds at all times, and it makes it even more confusing.Most of the time the game gives you zero idea of where to go and expects you to wander everywhere, groping around for your next objective. Using a guide is a must. I love the game so much that I created my own personal guide, but a casual fan will be turned off by the lack of any clear objectives. The game literally tells you nothing most of the time. Still a near-perfect game, Dragon Quest 4-6 are must-owns. I been playing DQ since I saw the announcement for XI S for the switch. Before it came out I play and bought 1,2, & 3 from the App Store. Now, that I have become such a big fan . I just finished playing 4-6.  You guys have to try and push for number 7 and 9 to be release on the IOS... Classic game,  lots of time to be spent grinding however I used this time to explore the entire map in dream realm and real world realm.  Eventually got Pegasus and was the point to go to the dread realm to fight mortamor.  However,  once in dread realm,  all the skills you‚Äôve been building up,  and magic gets taken away and you are basically defenseless.  I get killed 9/10 times when going from town to town,  and then resurrecting everyone costs too much and eventually you won‚Äôt have funds to do it, game over.  Was really fun until dread realm. "

Now that that‚Äôs done, normally have a relatively short attention span for any game, mobile or pc, but for some reason, this has held it. When the ads say constant updates, they mean it. Two heroes a month come out with constant events. Many times in mobile games there is stamina or lives to stop you from playing much at once. Hero hunters does have this, but since there are so many events and missions and pvp options it barely becomes a problem. That also stopped me from playing for hours on end. Which in turn stopped me from getting bored because on the game. To give an example on some games I will play 30-40 games and immediately get extremely bored. This game does have micro transactions which they are constantly pushing which can get annoying at points, but everything that you buy will permanently help you in some way. For example, if you buy gold and get some crafting materials, yes you will use them, and they are not infinite, but when you use them to upgrade a hero, it won‚Äôt become obsolete as heroes of every level are needed to progress (Gauntlet missions scale in difficulty, so even low level heroes help out a ton). Now this game isn‚Äôt perfect, but it is currently my favorite game and I highly recommend it. Let me just start by saying yes I am a real person and this is a genuine review. I started playing HH around the time it first dropped on mobile, and honestly there isn‚Äôt a single mobile game that I‚Äôve played that has kept me interested and engaged as long as this one! For starters, the game is super easy to pick up. It‚Äôs not difficult at all and there are plenty of heroes to unlock and upgrade so it‚Äôs not something you‚Äôll blow through in a short amount of time. There are multiple types of in game currency, as well as ‚Äúgold‚Äù which you can use to purchase crates that allow you to unlock characters a bit early. I know a lot of people see that and think ‚Äúmoney hungry‚Äù, but there honestly is no need to spend money on this game as they give you so many opportunities to earn the currency through participating in events! Something I‚Äôve never seen other devs do! This game has an energy system which early on really limited how much time you spent on the game, but now the devs have added several new game modes that don‚Äôt require it as well as daily quests and opportunities to earn more! All in all I recommend if you‚Äôre in to rpg shooters as this is probably my favorite mobile game of all time! 10/10 would recommend This is truly an amazing game I started playing I believe when it first came out got obsessed created my own alliance Alaska907 got my brother obsessed with it he joined my alliance and a couple of friends as well. It keeps me engaged and interested, longer than any game I‚Äôve ever played on mobile. There are of course a couple things I would change such as the alliance store it takes sooooo long to restock and they have a lot of the same things in there constantly. I‚Äôve been saving up alliance fragments to buy new hero fragments but it‚Äôs the same people over and over and I need new heroes. Also they start new god hero‚Äôs out at such a low star that after the events are over you toss the hero aside and don‚Äôt pay much attention to them because without them being at LEAST a 5 star they are useless. A couple of other minor things but for the most part those are my biggest concerns. Thanks hero hunters! :)Update...Of course I‚Äôm still playing and I still love this game! One thing I would love to see added in the next update would be a max hero skill button, I know it sounds like I‚Äôm to lazy to his a button 79 times to upgrade but it would save time to just hit one.

Nexomon, while having a lot of similarities to Pok√©mon, feels like something unique. Something special. I spent pretty much most of my free time playing this instead of actually gaming systems. It was actually something that pulled me in so much that I spent a couple nights where I only got about 3 hours of sleep before work. If you‚Äôre looking for something to remind you of the good ol Pok√©mon days, or even just a good game for younger kids that haven‚Äôt jumped into similar games yet, this is an amazing choice. The humor is spot on, they have amazing references to other pop culture things, and the game is very self aware it‚Äôs a game. The story is actually pretty nice and engaging as well. There are only a handful of faults that I can find, and most of that has to do with the cash shop in a paid game. Nothing in there is needed, so you can ignore it, but it is annoying because you will have two big buttons on the top right hand side the whole time you‚Äôre playing. These buttons take a lot of space and are only there to make sure you‚Äôre aware there is a cash shop. The game is so good that you‚Äôll forget they are there for most of your play time, but when you notice it, it‚Äôll get under your skin. The game is so good that I would honestly just pay for a full $20 release. A refreshing monster-collecting and battling RPG adventure. The storyline is enchanting and the characters are well designed and likable. The designs of the Nexomons are original and the animations are very smooth. The game isn‚Äôt P2W (pay to win) which is really nice. The extra purchase options will make the game easier, faster, or adds more customization options, but they‚Äôre not necessary at all to complete the game. The soundtrack is rather beautiful: relaxing at times and intense when appropriate. The creators and the team did a great job at developing this game and creating this universe. I only have a small issue with the game, and that is with the battle system. The statistics of the monsters isn‚Äôt well explained. Battling is very fluid for beginners to this genre of games, but could be very awkward for more advanced players. Most monsters don‚Äôt have very diverse strengths in stats with others of the same rarity level. Abilities/moves also don‚Äôt have an adequate description. You only know the energy costs for the moves, but the game doesn‚Äôt provide its Power or Accuracy. Also, status inflicting moves have a ridiculously low percent of landing. If the developers can change up the battling mechanics, this game would be perfect. I love this game I have micromon as well I'm a fan of this game creator I really like the art style of the game I love all the Nexomon and the game itself I do have a few suggestions to make the game like 1000% better ok here it is more Nexomon that can follow you like say shashock for example;) and dialogue options for the player character rather than atlas speaking for your character I find the hand holding in games is just far to much I also Heard that there is going to be story expansions that I am extremely excited for to be honest if you just slowly add more and more to the game it would be perfect just keep it going I mean even if I had to pay for each expansion or whatever I like this game so much I would iv already got everything in the other part of gem shop except repeal and iv got one avatar and one pet aka the Nexomon followers just want a fewLittle extra things ya know not much By the way I want to personally thank the creators of this app it is absolutely awesome I adore it so thank you Nexomon creators I absolutely appreciate the time and effort put into this game it brightens my days up I can't wait to see what else you come up with in the expansions ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç "

In the wolf game and in this game, you should be allowed to start a clan. To start a clan, you need 500 gems to unlock it. Whoever starts the clan, is the leader, and is the only person that can add people to the clan. If you make clans, then you should add cvc ( clan vs. clan) a little like pvp  but only clan members can join each side. It intensifies the game and doesn‚Äôt count individual people‚Äôs points. It takes team work. I hope you enjoyed my ideas! ( first of all, I love this game, love it, love it, love it. ) I have an idea - the dog or the cat. || THE DOG - Skins : The skins in it are different dog breeds. You can choose what dog to start as, each has their own tactical perks which doesn‚Äôt require points ( ex: a corgi would have lower strength but could dodge larger animal‚Äôs attacks more. ) You can choose what dog to auto start as, and the others are automatically unlocked. Some examples - German Shepherd, Husky, Doberman, Labrador, Golden Retriever, GrayHound, Saluki, St Bernard, etc. || MAPS - The starter map is a forest, the second is a human neighborhood ( you can‚Äôt kill humans, but you can attack other things. ) A mountain area, and an abandoned laboratory area. ( same for PVP Maps ) || THE CAT - Skins : You start as an orange tabby, and then you get a brown tabby, and then a black cat, then a cream colored cat, then a tuxedo cat, and the special ones are - winged cat ( no flying, just wings ) and the VIP is - a robo cat. || MAPS - First is a huge meadow with mountains, then a winter forest, then a Island MAP, then a beach. |||| It would make my YEAR if you looked into this! |||| ( first of all, I love this game, love it, love it, love it. ) I have an idea - the dog or the cat. || THE DOG - Skins : The skins in it are different dog breeds.

Playing through the levels over and over is fun. Plenty of variety since there are ten levels with varied Bots to fight and weapons to dodge. Roll, jump, or take cover. You can customize your own Bot with upgrades. Seriously great game for the low price. When you play this game for the first time, all difficulties besides ""Easy"" are locked.  On ""Easy,"" almost every level in this game is a cakewalk, with the exception of the actually-somewhat-challenging final boss. Then, when you beat the game, all the other difficulties are unlocked.  Now, you can play the exact same levels you just breezed through, except presumably harder.  I say ""presumably,"" because after a d*** move like that, I'm not touching this again.The sad part is that there are still a lot of collectible in-game logs to find on higher difficulties, and they're actually entertaining to read.  But they're not worth playing the game itself.  In retrospect, maybe the developers should have asked themselves whether, out of all the game mechanics the App Store sorely lacks, ""cover shooting"" was the one that desperately needed to be adapted. I‚Äôve played this on my old phone when the game first came out. I played it for ages and now I‚Äôm playing it again on a new phone. One thing I‚Äôve noticed comparing the older version of the game is the lighting. In the old version, I could actually see what was going on on the screen, and in the scrapyard I could see what my robot looks like with different equippment. The new version of the game changed the lighting so much that everything is unnecessarily bright, there‚Äôs so much white on the robot, and it doesn‚Äôt look cool anymore when I put on different equippment. I wish there was an option to change the lighting effect. "

It's also unique with the facial adjusting feature. Ijust had a few suggestions for a new update. 1. It would be cool if u could add a new feature where you can give her more than just ice powers, like fire or water powers, I know it's called ""Ice Princess"" but it's just a suggestion I thought would be interesting. 2. I would highly appreciate if you added a body adjusting feature. Like in the sims where u can expand body parts. If you can adjust the face to make it look the way you want then you should be able to adjust the body the way you want. Once again, these are just suggestions, I hope you consider these ideas for the next update.üíó So, here‚Äôs the rundown. The people are very scary. They don‚Äôt look realistic and they have super creepy smiles. You have to pay to go to the ball again, which I get but it‚Äôs like 18 hours! 3 at max! Also there are lots of ads. I also watch ads to get stuff but then don‚Äôt get it. Even after I watched the ad! Also I feel like you should be able to watch an ad for 1 trip to the spa or photo booth, just to see that buying is worth it, (if it is).  Also if you like Frozen, you might like this more it, has a lot of Frozen stuff. Also, in the add is says you have to push buttons to get the Dance moves right. That didn‚Äôt happen for my game. It might just be a glitch, but it might be false advertising. Also at the end of the dance, they ‚Äúfall in love.‚Äù But then the next dance the can choose a different prince and ‚Äúfall in love‚Äù all over again. I do like the dresses and makeup but you have to watch ads that won‚Äôt even give you the product! Over all, in my humble opinion, this is NOT a good game. It made me go to the ball when I didn‚Äôt‚Äôt want to, and it said it was a love story, but all they did was dance. It made me wait a day, and if you want unlimited access to the ballroom, you have to pay! If you want the spa, you have to pay! It eats up all of your money, and it is bad. You can play with dresses, but there aren‚Äôt many. The makeup is also just sooooooo big! I don‚Äôt like anything about this game. It says it‚Äôs a love story. Then connect it with the other } Ice princess games!üôÑü•± "

Thank you to the developers for porting over Titan Quest to iOS unmolested. Too bad they couldn‚Äôt of brought over the multiplayer feature as well. Great game, love it. Titan Quest has a special place in my heart. I started to play back when it was first released on PC in 2006. The unique setting, intricate class creation and amazing game flow still remain exciting to this day and I am thankful for developers that know that there are still fans of the classics out here.The mobile version is well ported in my opinion and I have not had any major issues. The targeting can be tricky so any characters that require specific aim may sometimes be frustrating to play, other than that it is amazing to play on phone and seriously one of the best values on the AppStore for this price. I give 4 stars only because there are some features that need to be updated that already exist on other platforms such as having a Storage vendor to store items, bigger inventory space, a button to sort items and other small QOL features. Also PLEASE bring the DLCs soon! üòä I ignored the other reviews saying it crashes and downloaded it anyway (because I love the game). The game constantly crashes, and is unplayable. Don‚Äôt be like me. It‚Äôs a great game, but this developer needs to fix this issue ASAP.Edit!!!!The Devs fixed the crashing issues (mostly) and the game is definitely playable. They also fixed Typhon so he uses his skills, instead of merely being a loot pi√±ata (which is kind of a bummer, but actually a good thing).

Try shutting down all background apps and freeing up some space before restarting your device. This should help fix the issue.  For the best experience we recommend you play Dark Fear on an iPad with a decent pair of headphones. DESCRIPTION You wake up in pitch blackness. You have no idea who you are, where you are or how you got here - it's up to you to figure it out!  For horror game fans seeking out that ultimate fix, 'Dark Fear' delivers an immersive, frightening experience wrapped in a cinematic soundtrack and a dark, twisted storyline written by an ex-film industry professional. The game can only described as blend between RPG and adventure with a 2D graphical style similar to the classic PC games from the 1980s (think Myst meets Kings Quest). Its simplistic approach allows even the most casual gamers to gently unfold and enjoy its many complex layers of game mechanics. Explore a diverse landscape filled with forests, mountains, lakes and deserts. Make allies in the local village, upgrade your weapon and armor, go hunting/fishing and fight your way to the truth by slaying your foes, solving puzzles and helping people with their problems.

I rarely give 5 star reviews, this one definitely deserves it. I think maybe people are put off by the old-style pixelated graphics, but that is a big mistake. Especially if you are looking for a good adventure game that is also quite scary! I was surprised that a pixelated-style graphics game could be scary at all, but it certainly delivers. If the graphics were more realistic, it would've probably been too scary for me. It was just right. And I can't think of a thing to criticize about it, just like another great game, The Room. This game was fun, definitely worth the price, and I hope it gets more attention so this developer will hopefully make more super-enjoyable games. :) This game is incredible. I read the reviews and wondered why they were praising this relatively unknown game so much. Figured it was worth a try and I was not disappointed! The soundtrack is gorgeous, there are legitimate jump scares and creepy characters/landscapes. The puzzles are relatively easy but the storyline keeps you interested and engaged. I can not recommend this game more highly if you love adventure games. Where has this game been hiding, and WHY isn't it among Apple's best of the best?!? Despite the retro graphics, the game has exceptional gameplay, story, and soundtrack, and is even creepier than a lot of higher end games out there. Well worth the money you'd otherwise spend on a cheeseburger, and way more satisfying!Would love to see a sequel. "

Fast action, retro graphics, and a delightful chiptune soundtrack channel the high-score hysteria of old arcades, while role-playing fans will enjoy upgrading their character and customizing the game world. Six selectable heroes and multiple game modes add even more variety to this deceptively deep, wonderfully replayable experience. Great game, but two issues to fix. First, the Knave's upgrades are supposed to increase the gold he gets, but they don't seem to do anything. Second, the Archer is broken. He's nearly unusable because it's nearly impossible to avoid bumping into enemies during the cool down between charges (like the wizard's power, but not as good), his arrows miss (ha ha) the point of the game by flying in arches when the action is mostly on the ground, and most flagrantly, even though his dash should be invincible, he still takes damage if you try to dash through the Minotaur's charge, making it impossible to avoid being hurt by it. I've gotten up to the fifth boss, Deathworm, a few times with the knight (though I need a lot of luck to even get to Peloria, the fourth); the archer can't even get past Minotaur, the FIRST. Please revamp their designs. Also, please change something so that the Tamer won‚Äôt get screwed over should he lose his mount during the Peloria fight (or enter the fight without one, as is guaranteed during Boss Rush mode); I haven‚Äôt experienced it myself, but it is apparently a serious issue. Slayin is a little game that is shockingly entertaining. It has a surprising amount of replay ability despite its repetitiveness. The game is a some what of a mix between a shoot-em up and an endless runner, with the player being tasked to survive eight consecutive areas with a stage boss fight for each. The repetition comes from having to restart each time you die, and getting back to where you were can take a long time. However I was never too put off by this since there is a quite a bit off variety with the six unlockable characters and the in-level weapon and armor upgrades. It's simply a blast to go through and try to master every character and their weapons. There's also two extra unlockable modes to give the game more content. I was initially a bit worried about the microtransactions being too intrusive, but I never felt pressured into spending more money. Slayin may be short and repetitive, but dang if it isn't one of the best uses for a dollar out there. "

As a board gamer, it's similar to Descent in play with character development and making sure you use your party skills to best the bad guys. There doesn't seem to be a lot of variation so far in character level up, meaning that there's only one skill track for each character which might be limiting but in fairness it's a bit early to say yet. Good job so far. Bought game in combo pack. Really enjoying it and got my girlfriend into it. Graphics like old school game and nice storyline. Is a good to just pick up and play. Dose contain micro transactions but game really doesn't force you to having a great experience. "

Just a few things I‚Äôd love to see: 1. Can you please move the boosters from the lower part of the screen? As a right-handed person, I keep pushing them on accident as I‚Äôm trying to move my character around the screen. My husband (a lefty) had the same problem when they were on the left part of the screen. Very, very frustrating! Move them some where in the upper half of the screen, please! (I‚Äôm begging you!üôèüèª) 2. Maybe there could be a special level available once in a while to help gamers collect the iron and red gems needed to upgrade the stronghold?3. I love trying to achieve the various characters! If you‚Äôre ever looking for new characters ideas, might I suggest you turn to mythology and the plethora of gods there. You could use some thing from each of their personalities as their special gift (e.g. lighting for Zeus, a war hammer for Thor, sunburst for Apollo, etc.) A new update came out today in the game removing the keys to open the chests, y‚Äôall gave us credit for the keys that we had and not the chests. I had over 40 normal chests and at least 2 Epic chests that I‚Äôve been trying to open, since removing the keys I just lost out on A LOT of iron, character tokens, and lots of other things. I am very upset that you guys cheated us out of the credit of those chests. It took lots of hours of game play to achieve those chests and just like that you removed them from my inventory. If I don‚Äôt get credit for those chests, I will delete this game. I have shared this game with a number of friends including my Fianc√© and they are all upset with this update as well. If this matter is not fixed or dealt with, we will all stop playing this game. It frustrates me because this was my favorite game but every time you do a new update I get cheated in a different way all the time. SoMerging needs to be done about this. Now anytime I try to watch an ad to open the video boxes the game freezes and the only way to fix it you have to leave the game, resulting in the loss of a life, many of the ads do this at the beginning at the game resulting in the loss of an additional life lost. This game seems to have more cheats and problems then the game is even worth playing. This game is no longer worth my time or effort if it‚Äôs always going to result in unhappy players! I spent a metric BUTTLOAD of time playing this game back when it was in Ye Olden Days‚Äîyou only had 3 lives, you regained one every 30 minutes, and your only objective was to find gems. You didn‚Äôt have to go to a goblin to cash in on your gems; if you died, they were still yours. Everything was perfect like that‚ÄîI enjoyed the simplicity, so I worked my way up to level 176. I completed the tasks for rebuilding the village to the max and just kept the extra stars I had in hopes that one day there‚Äôd be more tasks to spend them on. My pickaxe had nearly THREE HUNDRED hits. I even unlocked ALL of the little characters. I was having a blast‚Äîand then I took a break to spend time with my family after my brother went off to college and we had a series of hiccups in the family. Things died down and so, I finally came back...only to find all of my self-described accomplishments blown to BITS. Stars lost! Pickaxe at 30 hits! No characters! I have to talk to a goblin every two minutes or I lose everything! And all I got in compensation was a bunch of gold coins that I don‚Äôt even know the purpose of. I understand the revamp and I‚Äôm happy YOU like it,  but I‚Äôm just here to tell you that at LEAST one person absolutely hates it. I played this app for so long and all I got out of it was the developers spitting in my mouth. My disappointment is immeasurable. "

Instead of having to flip through countless books trying to find something specific, like a spell or racial feat from something less common, most of that is here and accessible within a few seconds. PSA: if you buy this, download discord and hop into their channel. You can speak directly to the developers and they‚Äôre very responsive. ALSO PSA: this app, while fantastic and easily the best out there in my opinion that I‚Äôve seen, is still in its youth. Be patient with the developers and let them update their content. All in all, I‚Äôm beyond happy with the Prism apps and look forward to using them to adventure away into the sunset for many years to come. Hi. I have downloaded this program onto two different devices. For the most part it works fine, but on my iPad you can‚Äôt scroll down on the ability cards. All the other cards work just fine though. On my iPhone, I was also having trouble with the ability cards. This time is wasn‚Äôt that I couldn‚Äôt scroll down, it was that when I try to search for specific items, just just blocks out the search bar all together. It makes it so I can‚Äôt search. Those where my only problems with the app besides it not having all the creatures, but then again, who will? Over all, it‚Äôs a great app and is definitely worth getting if you are a dm. Hey Nathon! Thanks for the review! I think we talked a bit over email about this issue. So we are currently reworking cards/compendium functionality in the player app which we will soon (hopefully this week) be moving over to the dm app. We are getting rid of the problematic search bar and adding better formatted spell cards for viewing in landscape/portrait. Thanks again! I‚Äôve been on the look out for a decent DM tool to use during my games. I have found a few apps that are ok at a few things. But none of which have had a solid foundation for the future. The PrismScrollDM app has that solid foundation to build upon. The UI is clean and useful. The performance is outstanding, and further more the developer/developers are responsive and always willing to answer your questions. If I could wish for anything, it would be that PrismScrollDM would take some ideas of out the app Encounter+I feel like the Prism team could make a much better, more refined version of that app. They certainly have the fan base. Hello Joshua and thank you for the review! The faith that you have in our products to grow reinforces our own belief for what we want to see PrismScroll become. I had actually talked with the developer(s) of Encounter+ a bit about there tv functionality. I think their product is awesome and has some pretty great functionality. I definitely think you are right in that there are things we could learn and apply to the PrismScroll way of doing things. Stay tuned! "

It's really fun, find clan members, kill enemies, find books. The graphics are a little off yes, the rabbits are as big as you are and your the biggest dog there! Well other than the Great Dog from The Great Clan, he's huge! The enemies are just too powerful, the other animals are able to get into your home base. How come the clan members can't go in the caves? You are going to die if they don't, trust me I've tried so many times. And how come we can't choose our breed? And the bred of our clan members? And how come it can't be like the Warrior Series by Erin Hunter? All the clans are enemies but they are usually at peace, read the Series or even just a few of the book to understand, or ask Mrs. Hunter herself! The game is fun and I would recommend it to my friends but I was hoping it would be like the Warrior Series. That would be awesome, like the way the clans in the  book are set up, and adding kits ash breeding! It's a really fun game over all, but this just seems like a rough draft of a game, please take my advice, thank you!

He deserves to make every game he wants some of them are 12+ and I think that he makes the perfect games what more could anyone want he‚Äôs made more than 30 games he‚Äôs made 45 games before in his lifetime I haven‚Äôt had all of them but I looked up who made all the games that I like and it‚Äôs him the author is really good I think he‚Äôs amazing not that I like like him like love. But I think that he‚Äôs really good at making games. Well, I want to start off by saying that this dude has a lot of other games, so it‚Äôs probably hard to keep up with  all of them. But this game has a few issues. First of all, can we please name our clan members and customize them? That‚Äôd be great. Also, can our clan members follow us when we like? And have a customizable den? You really wanted people to rate you, so I hope you listen to our suggestions. Thank you if you listen, "

'Examine' looks at the spot you clicked and 'Operate' tries to do something with this spot. Sometimes there are multiple choices that you can do or say. E.g.: 'Take the bottle' and 'Leave the bottle there'.In this case you will see this choice box before the text.Just click the choice you wish once to select it and once more to activate it. Its as simple as that!  The game is really open. You can go almost wherever you want. If you want to get out of a place and visit another one just click on this icon. It means that there is an exit. The character icon shows where you are standing on the place. You can climb ladders, sit on chairs etc. You can 'Use Items from the inventory' to that icon as if you want to 'Operate' something on you.

If you like old school fantasy RPG's like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Avadon, and Dungeons of Chaos on iOS, then this game is for you! I am so excited that this game is on iPad. The developer has done an amazing job. The story is really long and deep and the choices you make significantly change the events in the game. The battle system and leveling system are fun and fair. The graphics are old school--you have to be ready for some small detail, some reading, the occasional mis-click when a button is too small. No matter--this is the trade-off for a rich, strategic game instead of a cartoony slash fest. So worth it to have a game that is not dumbed down.  I really loved the first Avernum game and this one seems just as good, with an interesting history that continues rather than rehashes the story. One of the best single player RPGs I've ever played on any platform. Cheap at the price. Highly recommend. Requires iOS 9.1 or later.

‚ÄéDISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror,"DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is a 2D psychological horror adventure game. DISTRAINT was originally developed for PC and released on Steam 2015. In DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror you step into the shoes of an ambitious young man named Price. In order to forge a partnership from a famous company, Price seizes a property of an elderly woman. In that very moment he finds out the price of his humanity. This is his story and the tale of his regrets... __________________________________ FEATURES DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is a horror story. It is dark and grim but also has its share of dark humor.  The story progresses quickly which allows for several settings and scenarios. Your journey will last around two hours!  The gameplay is simple but effective: You move left and right and solve puzzles to progress through the story.  * Side scrolling 2D with unique, hand drawn graphics  * Atmospheric music and sound design  * Minimalist interface so your focus never wavers from the experience  * Delve into a unique story full of intriguing twists * Refined controls - Super easy to play on mobile devices __________________________________ SO MANY GAMES OUT THERE, WHY SHOULD I PLAY DISTRAINT? Right, so you're thinking if you would enjoy this little horror story? What makes DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror different than other horror games out there? That's a good question, I'd love to tell you more about the game and its atmosphere! This is not your typical modern horror game, jump scares and loud noises? Nope! Other horror games might rely solely on those but not DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror. DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is a psychological horror game which means the horror comes from its oppressing atmosphere and story. DISTRAINT: Pocket Pixel Horror is pretty subtle on its horror, it's suitable for both hardcore horror fans and people that haven't played too many horror games in the past. There are quite a few DISTRAINT (PC) reviews out there, check them out if you're still unsure whatever to buy this game. __________________________________ DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE IOS AND PC VERSIONS In order to make the iOS port as playable as possible I needed to make some small changes to the game. In PC version you have a lantern, but porting this over to iOS brought too many problems. I decided to leave the lantern out from the iOS version and instead expand the environmental lighting. While doing so I also added more color which makes the iOS port more pretty to look at. To have as smooth experience as possible I capped the iOS version to 30 frames per second. However, DISTRAINT has a very little motion so this is barely even noticeable.",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/3a/00/91/3a009172-109d-7785-135d-9b7cf131e36d/pr_source.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.2 ‚Ä¢ 37 Ratings,$0.99,,"April 19, 2017","I enjoyed this game for a number of reasons: original and logical puzzles,  interesting and believable storyline, a couple good puns, and a layer of creepiness over everything that happens. It took me 4-5 hours to play through and I had to look up two solutions online, but I loved the overall feel and experience. I disagree with the reviewer that said this game was a claim about ""capitalism"" and ""eminent domain"" and whatever; the game has a message but it's more about how your mental state reacts when you live your life in conflict with your personal moral values. I definitely recommend giving this game a shot! This has some horror elements, but overall I would say it is far more haunting. After awhile the story starts to drag down your soul. The music is fantastic, the characters were well done, and the puzzles were the right amount of tricky (for me - but I'm kinda lazy, I'm just in it for the story). There were slight grammar errors once you got further into the game, but the spelling was fine, as you said. If you want someone to touch up your sentences really quick so it's easier for people to stay in character, let me know. I won't charge, this was a lovely game and I'm willing to help. I'm am up to the 'flash lantern/color change thing' that blocks certain doorways with Mushrooms, and I admit I'm frustrated. But I love the soundtrack, the strange mix of horror and creepy atmosphere, but also mystery and drama, with a decent storyline.   I'm not sure of the original language but this translation to English seems good, there are no distracting grammar issues.  Looking forward to finishing it if I have the patience to get through this part. Great price, and love the retro graphics. Not TOO pixelated like many games do now.ThanksUpdate:Aaaaand ... wow that was bleak and sad.   But, it was very unique: not totally horror, because it's based on a regular humdrum human life. I thought the blend of normality and creepy surreal feelings was done really well. But, yes, it's depressing, but obviously that's the point. I thought the use of colors to switch things were interesting but got really annoying in the hotel. Definitely different! Thanks "

‚ÄéYume Nikki,"A masterpiece remained in the history of RPG Tool ""„ÇÜ„ÇÅ„Å´„Å£„Åç"". This is the smartphone application version. ¬∑ This is a game that walking around the world in the dreams of a hikikomori named Madotsuki with a very dark atmosphere. ¬∑ There is no particular story or purpose.

Although this app plays well on my iPhone it does not look as great or run as well on the iPad. On the iPhone it performs flawlessly and feels very similar to the original classic except for a few menu and sound bugs. But for $2.99 this mobile port is a must grab for any huge Yume Nikki fan. To bad there is no controller support. Maybe that could be implemented in a future update? After reading the reviews, I had serious doubts about buying this app. But because I absolutely love this game so much, I decided to bite the bullet and I bought the app. First thing I noticed that that it was half the speed of the original. Many reviews say this, but I quickly discovered that you just have to turn off low power mode to have it run at normal speed. It is just like the original but with some inaccurate names for the effects, but other than that, I would say this is really worth it if you like Yume Nikki. But, there is only one problem. You can‚Äôt rotate the screen. It is always with the charger pointing to the right side of the phone, and even if you rotate the phone, nothing changes. But it‚Äôs not even that big of a problem, it‚Äôs only an issue if you are charging your phone and it creates an awkward angle.Overall, great app, and the other reviews are making it seem really bad, which it‚Äôs not. I like it a lot. First of all, I never bother with reviews, but Yume Nikki is a game so near and dear to my heart that I can‚Äôt stand seeing it done so dirty. First of all, the price point. If I‚Äôm going to /pay/ for a game that‚Äôs free on PC, it better be good. Especially more than a dollar. A huge issue in the game is the framerate. Going up/down staircases easily takes double the time it would normally, and the bike effect and speed glitch do little to help that. It takes an excessive amount of time. The controls aren‚Äôt intuitive, but I understand porting a game like this onto a device with no keyboard is difficult.Another technical issue is the fact that the music clips almost constantly, making some areas a pain to be in with sound on.There‚Äôs also a nitpick with the changing of some names. Medamaude and yuki onna have been changed to ‚Äúeye palm‚Äù and ‚Äúsnow woman,‚Äù which makes it hard for a die hard fan to locate in the menu.I‚Äôm excited to have a version I can take anywhere, but there are too many flaws right now for me to be able to excuse having to pay three dollars for an otherwise free game.

So I purchased The Whole game and guess what it gave me nothing I payed for it and said I had too pay too get full access so here is a lesson do not pay money from the stupid game. And it‚Äôs weird cause this is a KIDS GAME it‚Äôs just sad that you have too PAY and that there are soooooooooo many adds!

But, then I thought maybe Daryl and Matt are fraternal which is cool too. But, in Matt's parallel universe his brother was able to completely pass off as Matt and on the heroine's end they were identical. So, I'm wondering why it's not automatic in Daryl's universe that they're identical. That was the only confusing thing for me. I love the Ortega tornado and them being raised by their grandmother, I wonder if she'll be brought in to their stories. I don't get why Daryl is the ""evil"" twin either...yes he's in and out of the mafia and worries his brother half to death because of his need for thrill and danger, but evil twin? I've never got that. Daryl and Matt have their own barriers and views of the world. Where Matt's near death experience in underground fighting led him to get a desk job at a major Corp, Daryl kept going back because the underworld seems more fun than a typical day to day job. I'm glad Daryl got his own universe! The scenes are amazing, and if you‚Äôre a car fan, you‚Äôll be lured to this story as well.

I greatly enjoyed the mechanic of having control of two characters and potentially having two different personalities between the two. Plus I feel this game gives me an experience that isn‚Äôt all that touched on too well. The ability to be the villain! I‚Äôve played the academy for upcoming super villains and I enjoyed it my first time through. But ultimately it felt lacking in motivation. I entered the school because my mother was a villain? Here my character suffered a traumatic experience that caused serious mental and physical injuries. Also your choice of what villain you will be is a fine touch as well. And with how the ending appeared for me, I‚Äôm looking forward to a potential sequel. I can‚Äôt remember a time I read a story this quickly. It‚Äôs such an interesting world they‚Äôve created and the characters are all so interesting. In the beginning it felt a little more like you could steer the story yourself but as things progressed I felt more like the character‚Äôs bitterness kind of overwhelmed your ability to choose. So my choices looked out of place with the story. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the answers I chose earlier on, I don‚Äôt know, but playing a full on villain while not getting the full picture about what happened to make your character want to destroy their former friends/allies broke some of my immersion. If I‚Äôm gonna be that vengeful to some seemingly decent folks, I kind of want more of a complete picture. Maybe I‚Äôd have learned more about the incident from their past with different choices. Also RO wise, for a player choosing to date guys but not wanting to have a romantic relationship with Ortega, the interactions got a little frustrating.  Kind of felt like he was the only real option and he was constantly thrown at you. Regardless of the things I didn‚Äôt love, I really adore Fallen Hero and will replay it. Also excited for the next book!! The good: You‚Äôre playing a character who is struggling emotionally.  I would say that she had a mild personality disorder (inability to trust other people) which was exacerbated by PTSD.  Your choices and the writing manage to force you to stay within the constraints of your mental illness, while still allowing you some leeway about how to react in particular situations.  Because of the skillful writing, you can feel some of her emotions, like you would in a good novel.  More generally, the author really does know how to write well.  Setting the scene and dialogue/banter are novel-quality, which is not the case in many CoG/Hosted Games.The bad: A lot of information crucial to your character is revealed piecemeal throughout the story.  I think some of it still hasn‚Äôt been revealed.  This includes her history (events that made her the way she is), her goals, and the practical plans to accomplish them.  Since your character would know all of these things, it left me feeling unable to fully absorb myself in her.  I could feel her emotions like she was a whole person, but when I tried to think like her, she was a cardboard cutout. "

What would make it more fun? More variety! Also I feel upset because I have this massive farm with a ton of land but I can‚Äôt receive any help from the harvest sprites like I could in the other game?!? What‚Äôs the use in befriending them then?I think if you could do an update where the harvest sprites could help care for the farm that would be great. Also I love my husband but lol it‚Äôs so boring having one. It‚Äôs not even like I can uphold a random convo with a villager so that‚Äôs odd. Also the fact that I can‚Äôt build more coops or barns is extremely frustrating.Anyways, so those are my main two complaints: help from harvest sprites and bigger coops and barns... I started playing this game about a week ago and loved it. I think it's a great app version format wise. I think a lot of people put too high of an expectation for it to be a replica of the console games but that's not what it is and I think the developers to great designing according to the convenience of an app and it is so fun with all the same features of the console versions in app form. The sad part for me is that not all of the glitches have been fixed and I really hope they are soon because I love the app version and want to continue playing but will have to delete it if I can't play it. I've read other people experiencing different types of glitches as well but for me I am stuck on the loading glitch which won't allow me to get past fall 23 year 1. I go to sleep but it just stays on the black screen with the circle spinning in the middle. I tried saving then sleeping, waiting until 5:00am in the game when the harvest sprite forces you to go to sleep, and exiting all apps and rebooting my phone as CeeCee has told others online but still nothing. Please fix this Natsume I love your games and want to keep playing. I‚Äôve been in love with the Harvest Moon games since I was a kid and honestly, this is seriously disappointing. What‚Äôs the point in having to switch to farming mode just to pull weeds and then back into talking mode to pick up my chickens? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm planning on using my hammer on my chickens or talking to the weeds. I also would like to point out that I gained 4,075 gold pieces from selling my harvest, and when I saved and went back into the game later on, I only had 2,045 gold pieces. Maybe a toggle button in the bottom corner is easier for moving your character than whatever is being used now because I am constantly getting stuck. WHY DONT THE HARVEST SPRITES DO ANYTHING????????????????? I was already upset that there were only three but now I‚Äôm upset because my character constantly faints from over exhaustion because there is so much to do and not enough energy. I‚Äôm seriously so upset I paid $4.99 for this app when Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was free and absolutely a better reboot than this app. Please please please, I‚Äôm begging you. Fix this. "

I see people on every single app complaining about pay to win. This is simply what gaming has evolved into especially apps. This game is super fun and simple to play. I‚Äôve been playing for about 3 weeks now. The reward system is super good in this game also. Diamonds is the game $$ currency and I can literally make 1000+ diamonds a day doing daily‚Äôs and events. If you want a boost in this game I suggest buying a couple SS heroes and then you will be set. You will just have to grind daily to get souls to upgrade your heroes star rating. But of course you could also pay to get them up. All in all it‚Äôs a fun time killer. I recommend it Typical Pay-To-Win game. I don't deny that I get some fun from this game, but also equivalent frustration. It's an interesting idea to deal damage by moving heroes like playing pool on the table. However, there are like zero balance between different heroes, some are powerful enough to wipe out a team, but some are absolutely useless, regardless how much Power that hero has. Samely, heroes rely on some equipments in particular way too much while other equipments are not needed at all. There are also some problems with the game mechanics. For instance, in the section names Ancient Warpath, basically you need to challenge bosses with more difficulties like banning heroes, losing health by time, random rooting and stunning, etcs. Like I said, it's a good idea but poorly designed. In often cases all your four heroes will be rooted, which means you can do nothing but taking damage for multiple rounds. Normally, you have failed to pass this level when this happens. Unless you pay for super powerful heroes, you have to hope this won't happen and win the game by chance, which is very frustrating. I have been playing this game for probably over a year. I have spent money on this game. Enough to be VIP 10. I was level 76. Then the game said I needed to ‚Äúupdate‚Äù. I did then signed into the game and was back to level 1. All my purchases gone. The stole everything I spent my money on in this game. I definitely would not purchase anything in this game. They will just take it back. Play it but don‚Äôt spend any money.It has been almost a week of having my account erased. I had to reach out to them. If I hadn‚Äôt contacted them, my account would‚Äôve been lost forever. But they have finally found my account and restored it with no apologies or any kind of in game gift to attempt to make up or the inconvenience. Every other game I play gives some sort of gift to kinda say sorry for the inconvenience. Most of the time it‚Äôs because of a server down time for maintenance. I don‚Äôt expect anything for server maintenance as it is part of the game. Hyper heroes erased me from the board and didn‚Äôt do anything to recover my account until I reached out to them. Very bad form. "

There's really only one bad thing about it, and that's a less-than-optimal user interface. You cannot reorganize bakery equipment (say, to group your ovens together) without selling and rebuying equipment. Apart from that minor irritation, though, a worthy game for would-be bakers. Lengthy review but my honest opinion...I, like everyone else probably, tried the demo version first to see if it was worth buying the full version. And wouldn‚Äôt you know, it was addicting enough to think the full version was worth it! So I said, cool, I got $3 to spare, I guess. (Side note: I‚Äôm not so big on game apps so, for me, it‚Äôs a huge deal when I find one I actually like.) so yeah...clearly this game WAS worthy of a five star rating until...-1 star: it only goes up to 30 levels. And that‚Äôs easy to reach, really. Truth be told, because of this quarantine life, I got there in less than a day. So imagine my disappointment when it said I‚Äôd hit the max level. Whomp whomp. Unless the creators decide in the future that they‚Äôll offer more levels in an update, this game is NOT worth spending money on.-1 star: it makes you think you need to buy (on the game, not real purchases) all the different recipes like the popsicles, pretzels, and ice cream. But hey hey...guess what...I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve only sold one or two ice cream cones  , zero pretzels, and zero popsicles in thirty levels. -1 star: cost of the actual app should be $0.99 if you‚Äôre gonna charge people for a limited level game. Sounds stupid, but three dollars is too expensive for what you‚Äôre given when you basically get the same quality as the demo.Just save y‚Äôalls $3 and stick with the demo. That way you won‚Äôt be in my dilemma:I wanna delete the app but I paid for it so no. I love this game! Baking cakes and pies in between helping customers, pricing your products, stocking your kitchen, using your oven space wisely, trying to keep up during the busy times, and organizing and cleaning your shelves when it's slow, this game has so many elements of a real bakery! Please buy it and give it a try. It costs less than your lunch, but will give you hours of entertainment. "

Keep up the great work. üòäI am having one small problem. When I'm in the menus I cannot scroll all the way to the bottom. It brings me close to, but lower than, the middle. I, and many of us would like a fix for this. Otherwise, not having any issues. üòå I got this app for my iPad because I've had the mobile version for some time and wanted to show my support. Overall it's a pretty good app but I'm not to impressed with this version, I would have been better off saving my $3. Before my purchase I read the reviews and heard about the menu cut off issue. 'How bad could it be?' I found myself saying, but it's already so annoying on day one that I'm going to keep using the mobile version till this is corrected. Maybe it's just me but shouldn't this issue been caught in testing before release?Also, I'm not to impressed by the layout. Being that this is an 'HD' version of the app I was expecting larger or clearer images and menus. How the UI is set up would be great and more like what I was hoping for if the app wasn't locked in landscape view. Seems like a waste of potential display room. I'd be fine with the main roots of the menus got overlapped or disappeared in order for a larger display of the item or article I'm trying to read about. This poor display scheme will also keep me using the mobile version. When I run the phone version on my iPad I get everything I want, just not the crispness I thought this 'HD' version would deliver. This game helps a  lot because when I was playing minecraft I didn't know how to make a cake and it showed me how. It also shows you some seeds for cool places and it gives you the ability to make your own skin. I recommend you get this app if your new to minecraft. Sometimes I just sit on my couch and look at this app and find something new. If you already own this app and are reading this review I hope you enjoy this app as much as I do.It really helps!!!! üòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ "

But all the iOS Microid games I've played have been seriously truncated. This is no exception. Entire puzzles are missing, or have simply become a cut-out scene. The resulting game play feels far too easy. It probably won't disappoint if you didn't play it on PC, but if you did, prepare to feel short-changed. That said, and despite it being too short, it's still an okay adventure game. And I'd much rather these classic games were adapted than not, so three stars here. Please, do the very first Atlantis next, and don't skip anything! So apparently this version of the game skips about 95% of the content from the PC version. Missed dialogues, interactions and more. The game makes no sense to me and this is the only version I have played (googled a guide from gameboomers to see if I missed some stuff. Turns out I missed the whole story :/) Unlike a previous reviewer I like the graphics, though not the Near-East type world they create at the beginning of the game. Fortunately that world is left behind soon. Judging this game by comparing it to most games out there, I'm giving it five stars.  I love this type of straightforward, gimmickless  adventure game, and the occasional humor was nice.  But I got spoiled by some of the other Microids games out there, such as the two Dracula games and Amerzone, and this one seemed a bit more choppy and less consistent, probably because it contained more worlds.  I may also have a bias toward dark, Dracula-type themes. But I'll gladly replay this game before I play another silly hidden objects game.SPOILERSIf you're still wandering in the hills, look for a cave. If you have no stick to make a fire, it's because you haven't found the right stick yet. If the two sages don't answer your questions, it's because you haven't approached them in the right order. (""Come child"" means come ask ME the next question.)  If you want to win this game, don't just look straight ahead, look all around you, including the ground. "

It is not the most original concept but it is handled well and there are quite a few elements that turn now mundane story tropes into something refreshing and almost new. Most importantly it was a lot of fun. I thoroughly enjoyed reading through every line and page and I especially appreciated the length, allowing you to get drawn into the story and characters without feeling like it drags on. There are some errors in coding but nothing that won‚Äôt get sorted out within a few days. And perhaps even more so this was the first time since probably choice of robots that I did not feel like I had to restart on the first playthrough. The game is very good about working within your choices as long as you present consistency of character. It will still punish you on mistakes but even those are done so well that you feel like it‚Äôs just indeed another branch or path as opposed to a mistake. I loved the main character and playing as her and felt like my play style very well reflected in the writing. I don‚Äôt review things, but in my fever induced mania perhaps I‚Äôm turning over a new leaf. I‚Äôve played lots of excellent Choice Of games, my favorites being the Heroes series, so you can probably see a trend here. But I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve ever been as drawn into a world like I have with Superlatives. Weather Control is one of my favorite powers so that helps, and I genuinely enjoy leading a team where other games have only given you the facade of doing so, that I‚Äôve played anyway. I like the characters, I‚Äôm genuinely interested to see what each one thinks and says, who they are as people and heroes. Now I‚Äôm not that far in, maybe chapter 5 or so, but everything is so consistent thus far that I‚Äôd be surprised if it took a nose dive. I‚Äôll certainly review again once I‚Äôve finished but I look forward to playing the rest with great aplomb. This game was awesome. I wish I could have gotten a little deeper into my romance with Hugh, but otherwise I have no complaints. I used to read choose your own adventure books as a kid. This is the first adult kind of version of that which I‚Äôve really enjoyed. :) "

I contacted devs but their response was in no way helpful.  So, it is unplayable. I even started from the beginning again but the nasty glitch wont allow me to continue. Delete. I am very happy this was ported to the iOS. I have never actually played the original so I was quite surprised when I found out having played the original just now, after playing the iOS port, a lot was cut out of this version. For instance, there is a particular puzzle that require you to actually think about placement and numbers in order to be solved. I don't know why this was cut out of the iOS version, but simply clicking the very puzzle itself solves it. I found this to be a huge disappointment. The images are a little blurrier and really could be made crisp again. This would also aid in all the puzzle processes, if those were ever brought back to this version. Overall, this is a port of an original point-and-click fantasy adventure/puzzle game (similar to the Myst series). I personally can't see anyone who had not played any Atlantis: The Lost Tales games to be able to keep their interest in this particular title. If you missed out on that great gem of a game, I can't say for sure whether this game could capture an audience all on its own. I, however, very much enjoyed it despite the fact I was robbed of the puzzling that is essential to the game. 3/5 "

Beautiful graphics and sound (although I prefer the TurboGrafx-16 music over any other version, sad that it was not available as a music option) and lots of fun to play again.If I could change one thing, it would be to add a FIXED gamepad on the screen.  They do have the option for a ""fixed pad"" but it can be anywhere on the screen.  Too much freedom in that has led me to trouble many times, and I know I'm not the only one who had this comment.Otherwise, brilliant game and I hope they bring some of the other Ys games to iOS!  Well done.  üòä Love all things Ys, except this (chronicles) port‚Äîwhich I now despise. On a platform with d-pads and buttons chronicles is epic, the mobile ports however (what with having to drag your finger around and/or mash spots in the corners) is unplayable garbage for anyone with hands larger than an eight year old thanks to how easy it is for said actions to obscure ones field of view‚Äîwhich typically results in repeated death during boss fights (to the point of rage).My review: this/these port(s) should be buried in the desert next to NES ET.

It's moderately entertaining with a decent play time (I obtained and maxed out every ability in the game and hit level 99, clocking in about 65 hours). However, most of that time is really letting the game play itself with autobattle. It's really only a handful of fights where you need to intervene directly. The game was originally designed as a freemium mobile game and it's painfully obvious how the focus used to be on the business (enticing people to spend money on the microtransactions) rather than making a game that's genuinely well-crafted. It's been redesigned to eliminate the microtransactions. but with the deterministic drops of the signets, it feels a bit broken, since some abilities are clearly junk that are not worth upgrading, and yet, it just becomes the norm to do so because everything is handed to you as the result of story progression. It's OK as a pay-once game that it currently is but definitely isn't the best that SE has to offer. 4 stars just because I somehow managed to max everything out without uninstalling. FFD2 does a lot of things right - and a few things wrong.The bad: The title - FF Dimensions 2 - is misleading to those of us who played the first game. No random encounters. No towns or dungeons to explore. No overwork map to blaze across. Meanwhile, FFD 1 had all of those elements. I personally feel that the game should have been called something else - many folks were disappointed enough by these changes that  they never have the game a chance - which is too bad, because for what it is, and what it‚Äôs trying to be, FFD2 is quite good.The game starts slow - it take some time before your characters start getting new abilities to make the fights more interesting. I almost quit at one point - but I‚Äôm glad that I didn‚Äôt.The good: Everything else. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and experimenting w different party combinations. Battles are fun and fast, and the game is absolutely loaded with countless FF franchise references and details, making the game extra fun for those of us who have played many of the earlier FF games (e.g. The Tower of Babil music is a great remix of FF4‚Äôs original ToB music). Overall, the playable characters are enjoyable and have personality - maybe not as deep or as great as some past characters from previous FF games (Edge, Locke, Barret, Celes, etc.), but still enjoyable nonetheless.Put in over 50 hours, was well worth the sale price of 7$. Got my money‚Äôs worth. For the Final Fantasy (FF) fan who thinks every FF title needs to be an exact carbon copy of every other FF title: if that is your expectation then you might be disappointed. My first impressions of the game are very positive overall. I feel like things are streamlined in such a way to keep the player steadily advancing while constantly adding in new elements of play. It also appears that Square Enix (SE) has taken heed of what's currently popular in the mobile RPG market and incorporated it into their new title. Of course, it still has many of the common FF mainstays found in any other FF title, such as moogles, chocobos, turn-based combat, towns, shops, world maps, etc. The common core elements that identify a FF title are all there. It seems apparent to this long time, old school FF fan that this is a solid effort by SE to keep providing fans with more FF content that's relevant and high quality. However, I've not finished the game yet and although I highly doubt it, I could be wrong. I'll write the conclusion for this review upon finishing the game. For now, though, I'm quite satisfied. "

To resist the powerful Demon Lord, God created a human. Sacrificing his own body to seal the Demon Lord, God assigned the role of guarding that seal to the chosen one. Through an eternity of time, the seal has weakened, and a window to the underworld, ""Dark Gates"" have appeared in multiple locations.  Monsters start to invade the land. To break free from the doomed fate of man, they will rise and destroy every last ""Dark Gate""‚Ä¶ ** Overview of Dark Gate This game is a fantasy RPG.

However, this game has solid gameplay but a poor story. You will tire of the dialogue quickly, especially when Leo says, ""Leo's the name, RPG's my game."" In a way you can try to see how campy the dialogue is, in a sort of so bad it's good way. Darkgate just has you tap on tiers to change to stronger jobs and manually set individual abilities, so it is a bit confusing at first (with no tutorial). Fortunately it becomes simple to use once you get used to activating passive abilities and skills. You can also speed up battles and you basically break up auto battle with commands/abilities rather than input turns, so the fighting is nice. Fortunately, the game is an improvement on Grinsia because it has better menus and you can quickly enter/exit towns and dungeons. I do like how Darkgate lets you change the difficulty at any time in case there are spikes or you need a level 1 character to level up quickly. In short, play it while it is on sale if you need to laugh at something or are in an rpg drought. Another Hit-Point game that I just absolutely LOVE. It's probably the most complex of the Kemco RPGs, mainly because of the job system. You'll have to constantly change jobs depending on where you're going and what type of enemies you'll be facing, and it can be quite daunting at first. But once you get into it, it really shines. "

It can have more though. Here are  my ideas for more simulators: Ultimate Reptile Sim (iguanas, Komodo dragons, snakes, salamanders, etc.) Ultimate Fire Sim (It's where you get to be different Fire creatures like phoenix, Chinese dragon, Fire Crab, etc.) Same thing but with Earth, Wind, and Water. Wind: Wind Spirit, a smoky serpent-like creature. Wind Dragon, a dragon with feathered white wings on the end of its tail. The Wind Dragon's colors would be purple, gold, and white. Earth: Burrowing Dragons (the name says it all) They would dig underground palaces, caverns, etc. Grounders, small black, green, and brown creatures that create tunnels. Water: Water Dragons, dragons  with blue, purple, aquamarine, or sky blue fins on their tails. Fleepers, small, bright creatures that are like flying fish but instead in shades silver, bronze, blue, and purple.

Create. Conquer.,4.6 ‚Ä¢ 95.4K Ratings,Free,#60 in Adventure,"September 1, 2020","I am so glad this game popped up in ads online a few weeks ago. I have always been a huge fan of the computer and Xbox Elder Scrolls series. I thought since it was mobile that it may be a disappointment, BUT I absolutely love it. Amazing graphics for mobile, a nice storyline, it‚Äôs just like the other versions. I just defeated the Lich king or whatever and saved my city. I hope something new comes up in the storyline soon as now I only have small side mission quests to do from the board, which is completely repetitive. Perhaps when I fill up more empty slots in my city, more quests will pop up. We will see. People who complain about this being a p2p game are very impatient and/or unknowledgable. I am level 36 and for the most part getting there was f2p and without difficulty. I got some revival scrolls in the beginning levels, but that was with gems given to me in the game for free. Eventually I thought I might need a lot of gems or something later on and bought a cheat at a great deal with gems and revival scrolls that was 100 usd for only 20 usd. And guess what? I still haven‚Äôt even used those gems yet because it has so far been unnecessary. And only a handful of those scrolls which also one don‚Äôt really need although convenient. This is practically pretty much a f2p game. Those who complain it isn‚Äôt are probably (hopefully) kids who are impatient or don‚Äôt study all the parts to the game to see how to accomplish without paying. I've played this for awhile now. I also read all the reviews where people are saying is boring or hard around level 9. Here's the deal, this game is awesome if played correctly I'm currently level 24, with my town about level 7 ( just a bit under ), I don't know if people are not building their towns up, but that actually expands the game, brings in new missions, upgrading shops gives better options to craft or buy with in game currency. Early on when things are easy upgrade your inventory slots and chest capacity with the free premium gems they give you ( I get a lot free fighting in the dungeons) I have over 700 now, never bought anything. Time your chest timers around your work day, open gold while you sleep, never run into waiting issues. As far as combat and  complaining about dying, here's a tip get the healing dodge and upgrade it, choose your talents and perks wisely, craft health absorbing armor and jewelry, with the right loadout, and proper potion planning, no quest is too difficult, the challenging ones are harder because they're supposed to be, you'll have a wonderful feeling of accomplishment when they drop a free legendary chest on you.I'm level 24, all eleven gear, rings and necklace, usually have 15-20 various chests to cycle through, over 700 premium gems saved up from free drops, haven't spent a dime of real life currency.Play smart play often, this is an unbelievable free offering from the elder scrolls franchise!!!! I played for a month before writing this review because I understand it is still a beta release, Blades, in my opinion is by far the best game on a cellphone and trust me that I should be a critic I have played and deleted thousands of games. With all that being said Blades has amazing graphics that I would expect on a console, the gameplay is amazingly polished especially because you can tell they are improving it daily, when I first started Blades would shut down or freeze every so often (once a day) and now I cannot remember the last time that has happened. The pace of the game seems perfect to me as some days I don‚Äôt have as much time I will open the treasure chests and construct new buildings in my city and on the days I want to grind for gold, material or weapons etc etc... Blades surely lets me decide my own pace. I believe Bethesda is by far the best game developing company ever to make games so this is not a impartial  review, I already knew I would love this game as I have from everything they have ever released. So far the only thing I would like added to Blades is the ability to change between first person and third person as so many of Bethesda games have done in the past, it is amazing that this game is free because I dropped many other games off of my phone, Blades is all I need. Thank you Bethesda and also a thanks goes out to whoever read this book I just wrote. "

Besides that, this game offers an excellent range of game play at a very steady pace. It gives you reachable goals, a free boost up to lvl 1000, provides fun and difficult challenges, and I have paid $0 in total. You don‚Äôt NEED to buy the ‚ÄòStarter Pack‚Äô to progress. You just need to play. I‚Äôve been playing for a few weeks, logging on for my daily gems that the devs GIVE you, leveling things up, and repeating. It‚Äôs not mindless, because it still gives you daily quests to complete. It is a fun, easy game to pick up that you definitely do NOT have to pay to advance. However, I‚Äôm not saying you SHOULDN‚ÄôT pay, if you want to help out the devs with all of their hard work, you definitely CAN pay.All in all, great game, I‚Äôm on level 2500 and steadily rising every day. Wish I had more bottles, but it‚Äôs a minor hiccup in an all-around great game! I‚Äôve spent a few days playing this and I have to say I‚Äôm quite surprised. One of the better incremental games out there. I‚Äôd go so far as to say it has the potential of something like Tap Titans 2 if it‚Äôs done right. ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù currency is easy to get, yes there are ads but what game doesn‚Äôt have them. This one doesn‚Äôt really throw them in your face tho. And you don‚Äôt really miss out on much if you don‚Äôt watch them all. I‚Äôd personally like to see something of a guild/clan setup at some point, it‚Äôs one of the features I‚Äôd say is missing. Otherwise, and excellent idle or semi-idle game to play in my book. I‚Äôve played this game for a little over a week now, and I can safely review this game. It‚Äôs fun, has all the idle elements that you‚Äôd like to see. Upgrade system, different currencies, raids. But it‚Äôs greediness gets in it‚Äôs own way. What do I mean? Well do you want a new weapon? On that‚Äôs preferable Unique or Legendary? Well there‚Äôs only ONE way to acquire this. Either a single roll with 500 gems, (which is paid currency, and a fair amount of it. Roughly $5) that has a 7% of receiving decent items. Don‚Äôt want to roll? Well there‚Äôs another way to get the weapons! Buy them! For $10-$99!! That‚Äôs nonsense. I can‚Äôt play the game at a certain point because the upgrades that help progress to the next level, all require $. That‚Äôs just one atrocity among many in this game. Truthfully, I have no idea why this game has more than 3 stars. This is truly a mediocre game, with a shameful cash grab system. All in all, I say **** this developer. Make a game playable before adding the most shameless cash grab I‚Äôve seen. Shame shame. "

However, this game is P2W so it would help a lot if the developers think about lessening the cost of items and adding assistance for non-member players as they also seek to enjoy the thrill of the cinematic and mesmerizing graphics and interaction in the game to increase likeability. But with everything set aside this is an amazing game with a lot of cool adventures and you don't have to be on screen 24/7 to play as players can utilize the autoplay function in game.

I‚Äôm only here to help the developers and who ever else is tempted to download to try it out. Main things to fix or improve. 1. One crucial thing that I dislike about the game is that the story mode has got to get better more meaningful. There‚Äôs literally nothing going on I don‚Äôt even understand what I‚Äôm doing. That‚Äôs major thing to work on. Making sure that watch mission has some kind of story to it. It‚Äôs too cheesy. Five second sentences from each player we meet. Just very confusing and needs a good story mode. I would look into being able to click on what my character wants to say or react to the characters. This game needs it. At the moment all it is is just fighting that doesn‚Äôt make sense. Those are so crucial. Compared to all the other free games that have a killer story where you can interact with the story.  This game it does it for you and skins through it in like 1 second literally needs fixing or else your ratings will soon be going to one star. I see this game getting better just hope you take the advice. Bugs.1.Glitching when swimming. 2. To fast story mode. 3. Laggy in some parts of map. Hi, Hunter.

If you have any inquiries or additional suggestions, you may contact us through Customer Support. You may also visit our Official website and Fan Page for the latest news and updates about our game. Best, Devil Hunter Team I really like the game, however, there isn‚Äôt enough actual gameplay. You can set it on offline play, just do whatever else, then come back later and be on level 100+ or something. For me, I enjoy games that actively try to make you fight, for example, Darkness Rises by NEXON. The auto is just excessive.Another problem might be a personal one, but I can‚Äôt follow the story at all (if there is one). First off, you can tap and the interaction essentially goes away immediately. For someone who likes to tap and get all the text on-screen then read it out, this doesn‚Äôt work for me. I barely know what‚Äôs happening, and the lack of ability to turn off auto permanently makes me just being thrown into one group of monsters after the next. This forces me to ignore any sort of story that the game might have, which makes me really sad, since I love games with immersive stories.If there was something that would make the entire game better would be to have to option to turn off auto-battling completely. It‚Äôs fine to have auto-pathing, but for the entire game to play itself doesn‚Äôt give it any depth or purpose honestly. I‚Äôm sorry if this review seemed a bit brutal, but I‚Äôm inexperienced in writing reviews. It‚Äôs mostly because I truly think that this game can improve and become an amazing game. Hi, Hunter.

Also really cool to have a few free sound sets to give users a sample and a feel for the app. Great for GM‚Äôs who want to easily set the mood in their campaigns.A couple things that would make this app more user friendly and would increase to 4 or even 5 stars. 1. The app doesn‚Äôt run in the background, so music and sounds stop when switching between other apps. Forcing me to use multiple devices to run games as I use other apps for notes, NPCs, initiative tracking etc.2. The app has an extensive list of ALL the sound sets offered, and no way to filter that list. If you have purchased a sound set that appears at the bottom of the list you have to scroll all the way through every time. Would be great to have a filter to narrow the list making sets easier to find in game. 3. If using the app on your iPhone, make sure your silence switch is turned to the ringer position, otherwise you can‚Äôt hear anything, and  turn on do not disturb mode. Admittedly this isn‚Äôt that big of a deal but took me awhile to figure out. I always have my phone on silent mode. There is no way to register in the app!  You can submit fake log in info at which time the app asks if you have registered.  How?  There is no option.  I did find if you go to App Store and click on the problem with the app link it takes you to a website in which you can register.  Not user friendly, especially if the developers are trying to make some $.  Downloading free content?  Fine. Want to buy something?  Jump through hoops that are not readily visable. I've been using Syrinscape for 2 years now for my weekly Pathfinder game. The atmospheric sounds are absolutely amazing.  Players walk in to a quiet tavern and the sound of a crackling fire, a hushed conversation and a chair being moved fills the air.  The local drunk shoots off his mouth and at the click of a button the bar brawl sounds erupt and swords start flying.  Using the Windows version of the app has one major advantage over the iPhone in that the iPhone doesn't support surround sound. That of course is not the fault of the developer. Having the app on my phone is great for any pickup game or at next Convention. "

Genshin Impact has shown me that I waited long enough, the game asked me to write a review but I just couldn‚Äôt stop playing at the time. I have a few suggestions but the game doesn‚Äôt need major changes the updates are spontaneous but that is to come of a new game so it‚Äôs not a complaint, if you‚Äôre looking for a game that you can like and that has beautiful graphics along with fighting mechanics then this is your game. With the dungeons and monsters and many different places to visit it‚Äôs even fun just running around looking at the world, although one suggestion I have is that instead of just food to heal your party members why not add craftable health potions and such so my character doesn‚Äôt feel sick when eating so much üòÇ. The purity and smooth play of the game is phenomenal though, I‚Äôve already suggested it to a dozen people and I think this game has greater potential, on the other hand I was opening this was a open world multiplayer aswell, but the story says otherwise. If you need to relax and relieve stress this is the game, but if you want to play with friends and find people to meet you better have them added or you‚Äôll be alone like I am! All in all having a better friends system would be awesome but the game itself is phenomenal! Paimon is so Kawaii!!!!! So. The only problem I have with this game is the overwhelming lag that this game brings to the phone. If you guys could really fix this, I‚Äôd be very happy, cause I was Interested to see all of the amazing animations that you guys could bring to such a magnificent game as this one. Plus, it should be brought to my attention that you should get the material for wishes easier. I have been trying my hardest, but I always seem to get nothing, although I just do quests and stuff that don‚Äôt have them. (I understand that this is a very early version of the game, and your improving it.) Also, VERY. good job on the character models for this game. Honestly, this is the first ever good RPG game, making the fact that all the others were not very good, since it limits you to a lobby, not experiencing the world, and just fighting. I would also like to add, something That would improve this game a lot is if you guys had different Customizations. Like Clothes, Wing Gliders (there are 3 available so, I guess I have a wrong point there) And much more! It would seem to me so fun if there was a whole variety to this game. Also, Amazing game on the characters. I really like all of them, and I favor this game a lot. As being one of your big fans, please take these ideas into suggestion and improve the game early on! I would love to see this game being one of the most played games in the world ! ! I hope the best of luck to you guys! People are calling this game ‚Äúanime Legend of Zelda,‚Äù which is pretty much true. It is so fantastic and honestly I‚Äôm so in love with it. The storyline, combat, graphics, everything is great! The fact that you can switch characters to fight certain elements is something that I really like, especially with the really amazing voice acting that comes with it. I haven‚Äôt been this invested in a game in a while and I‚Äôm ready to play it through and through. I haven‚Äôt found any glitches yet so far so that‚Äôs Great!     One thing I will say, though, is that I really am excited for this to come out on Xbox and the Nintendo Switch. I kind of hope it could come out on Mac but Mac has been kind of complicated recently and various games have been becoming incompatible with it due to new updates. I also would love it if mounts were a thing. Even if horses can‚Äôt be programmed into the game, at least a hoverboard or something that goes equally as fast as the running speed. This game, I understand, just got released so there‚Äôs still obviously more things to do, so I can‚Äôt wait to see what more there is to come! I love everything about this game, I forgot to say how glorious the music is, too, and I‚Äôm just honestly amazed. Anyways, weeb/geek rant over. I‚Äôm just too happy with this game.

I love the gameplay, art-style, and story, and the whole thing just makes me want to watch anime again. It‚Äôs not difficult to learn the controls with the easy to follow tutorials and it‚Äôs simple enough that before some of the tutorials showed up, I could already figure out what to do. The heroes are all so cool and it‚Äôs not hard to find a valence between attack, support, hybrid, and defense heroes. It‚Äôs also easy to level up and evolve your heroes with the constant rewards and achievement system, with easy to beat special dungeons to earn growth items. Now this game isn‚Äôt all that simple, I thought I was unbeatable in the PvP arena my first 15 attempts until I got smacked by someone‚Äôs team with a higher rating/better team balancing. It‚Äôs a matter of making sure your heroes are up to par and are advanced out the wazoo, as well as playing the right attacks. I do have one problem that happens every so often after a couple hours of straight through playing which is that the app just closes on me while I‚Äôm waiting for a clear screen to load up or when I‚Äôm waiting for my free summoned hero to load every morning, and it‚Äôs just annoying because I don‚Äôt even get my rewards for it just closes to soon. Besides that bug, I absolutely approve of this game and recommend to anyone who‚Äôs thinking about trying it out! This game is highly enjoyable with fantastic graphics and smooth gameplay. Characters with their own personalities that clearly distinguish themselves from the rest. A system to where, until 9/5/18, any item or character could be obtain by both free to play and pay to win players. Netmarble has truly made a game that Free to Play and Pay to Win players can enjoy together. Although the one draw back that this game has is with the implementation of the costume system. Every aspect of the game, before the introduction of costumes, was as close to perfect as a free to play game could achieve. The aspect of free to play friendly has been tainted by the costumes that can only be purchased with actual dollars. Though costumes are supposed to be cosmetic, three costumes in particular, are straight upgrades to the hero. Thus tilting the balance of power towards pay to win players. With the costumes that provide a straight upgrade available to only to those who can pay with actual dollars and not those who play for free. Ruins equality of the game to the player base. A remedy to this would be to convert the price from dollars to gems. Though the decision is ultimately up to the developers whether they will change the costume system. Final thoughts, Knights Chronicle is a game that more people should get involved in and support. This game is highly recommended for its content and I have a fairly great time playing it.  Its mechanics are really fine tuned and the art is amazing (As said by any other review). I do not understand how people complain about the SSRs and SSR drop rates as the game is pretty generous handing them out weekly and events that consistently come,  boost SSR drop rates to 4.2%. Obtaining Gems or rare currency is very easy and just need some grinding (which is given daily by completing achievements or you can obtain a-lot by PVP or just playing the story as each level gives you 3-5 gems) Paying for Gems is basically you being lazy not to grind for them which is perfectly understandable (Grinding is easy as you can auto battle) The main complaint I have is what many other users complain which is the ridiculous 727mb download during launch, I understand maybe there is issues that cannot be resolved but I would be happy to at least receive a explanation of why it is required to download that much data. However this game is really well made and I recommend to those who wanna kill some time :) . "

Also there is a bug with the other wolves in your pack involving their tail? Also I like the personality think but I think you should add a stay button on your pack for like wolf pups. I think your pack should always follow you and stay near and not wonder off and get stuck glitching in the map you also need to fix the interactions on the zoom in and and zoom out that kinda stuff and maybe make the lakes have rocks underneath and maybe some tiny creek plants. Also I recommend you make a ultimate hyena sim 2 and dog because the last dog one you made was not to be rude pretty bad. I also think when you have pups that when the grow up their wolf pup fur changes into one of a random choice in the coat colors that would be cool. Also with the person my wolf is always gloating so maybe make some different personality and feelings and stories on how the wolves meet instead of the same thing and make it to where you can choose one wolf to be your mate so you can keep the bond you made with that wolf and maybe family relationships like brother, sister stuff like that please read this and maybe think about my recommendations please thank you I really love that game. Overall, this game is a very good one! However, there are many bugs. It is understandable that there are going to be bugs in a newer game, but some of them are too large and too obvious to be looked over and affects the overall game. The boss battles in this game are several elemental spirits. So far, I have beat the earth and water spirit. But every time I come to the fire spirit, glitches occur. In the beginning i would get very close to killing the boss, I would turn and run back to heal a little, turn back and the boss starts over. I was still in complete range of the boos battle, and I was in the range of the bosses fire, but apparently not enough for the battle to continue after five seconds of wait? I continued to fight the boss, but each time I was about a quarter of the way from killing the fire spirit, the game reset. I would give the game benefit of the doubt and say it‚Äôs incompatible with my device, but I‚Äôve tried it on several devices now and it does not change. Another glitch occurs after battles with smaller animals. After killing them, I am stuck on the camera setting that only is supposed to exist when a fight occurs. I tried turning on and off locked camera, going to a den, everything. The only way it works is if I leave the game and go back, but then I end up losing some of my game data? Again, this is a really fun game, but the glitches are VERY annoying. I had 3 pack mates. Crobel, my main character, Eroa, and then Hades, the son of Crobel and Eroa. He‚Äôs a puppy. I was switching back and forth between the three playing as them all when suddenly Eroa went missing. I went and tapped on her icon, and she fell from the sky onto a totally different part of the map. So, I opened the map and tapped on a den to teleport there, but instead, she died(?), and her icon was replaced with Hades. There were TWO Hades?? I refreshed multiple times, but I can no longer play as Eroa. I can see Eroa and interact with her, but I can‚Äôt play as her. There aren‚Äôt two physical Hades, but there are two icons of Hades, one replacing where Eroa should be. I tap on both and they take me to Hades, and sometimes it replaces the duplicate Hades with a duplicate Crobel. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to play as Eroa. I‚Äôm scared to delete one of the Hades because I don‚Äôt know if that will delete Eroa or if it will delete Hades, so I don‚Äôt want to do that. Please try and fix this. I‚Äôve been noticing a lot that whenever I tap on a den icon, the wolf dies and switches to another one, but this is the first time anything like this has happened alongside it. "

So I know what should be done and how things should work. I have this game 3 stars because it still has simi slow servers and there are tons of small glitches and some pretty big glitches as well. Some small ones are, when you first port somewhere you don‚Äôt have a tag and people think your tag less, which is fine just a glitch but a big one I‚Äôm noticing with everyone is that sometimes you will have all your troops home yet when you go to send them somewhere, their simply gone. This happened to me while I was out attacking a hive, after about 3 attacks the game did a little lag and suddenly my troops disappeared I couldn‚Äôt send them out yet I had all my power. To fix this you have to reset your game, but what if I‚Äôm not done attacking and when I reset my game I big guy comes in and zeros me. I‚Äôve spent hundreds of dollars on this game. If that were to happen to me I would be all over. Complaining a storm. Also while your in the chinook if your being attacked your screen isn‚Äôt red so you have no idea if your being attacked, you should add that. Thanks for reading and please fix the troop glitch because I‚Äôm noticing it more and more. If I changes I‚Äôll make this a 5 star. Cause it‚Äôs a really cool game just needs updating in the right places Dear commander, please contact the Customer Support to solve the prblem about losing troops. They would take care of the problem as soon as they receive it. As for the suggestion you provide, it has been reported to devs. Believe that they would think about that. Thank you for your support. From the beginning of the game they give you a chance to build up and survive amongst the other players by early on unlocking a piggy bank allowing you to keep resources if you are attacked. Now let me say now at a level 23 command that bank doesn‚Äôt do much but in the first few days that helped me keep my drive on building and gathering resources. What pushes me now is my great corps that I‚Äôm apart of they help protect me and others on the battlefield and help keep peace and order during the week but on the weekend expect pure chaos. Be prepared to put a shield and wait to the weekend is over to gather resources outside of corps gathering plot or else certain death may come to your troops. With all the things that have changed and happened with this game over the year or so I‚Äôve played it I give it 4 stars it‚Äôs fun and frustrating at times but what‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen is you lose your army and resources oh and don‚Äôt forget the flames you have to look at if you get attacked to but other than that this is a long term fun strategy game I love and recommend to my friends all the time. Occasionally there are bugs but I report it to the devs right away and they usually take care of them in a day or so. I‚Äôm happy to play this game all the time and will continue. Have fun gaming I‚Äôve very much enjoyed this game! It is very intuitive, yet complex enough to require strategy and planning to be successful in the various events and challenges. The constant flow of events keep the game fresh, and the various perks (corps boss, corps resources, etc.) of belonging to a corps make playing the game with others a cooperative pleasure. I‚Äôve appreciated the various aspects of regular game play, such as the acquisition and training of officers, upgrading your buildings and troops, and attacking other commanders in the battlefield. My biggest problem has been that I have so much fun, I struggle to keep from getting sucked in and spending time away from other, more important things (family, work, etc.). I definitely recommend this game!      One suggestion for the developers - the game is marketed to a male audience, which is fine. I think that female consumers may enjoy playing, but may be put off by the appearance of the female officers in the game. The game may have a broader appeal if the women officers were more appropriately attired and presented more as equals than as objects of a young boy‚Äôs fantasies. Just my two cents... "

‚ÄéThe Mines of Immortia,"Mines of Immortia is an Interactive Fiction game that leans heavily on the rules created for the tabletop role-playing game, Dungeon World. Play to find out what happens as you delve into the depths of the Mines of Immortia. The game has many different paths to get you to the end with two different ending scenarios depending on how you do getting there. Several of the rooms you encounter are randomly chosen to offer additional replayability.",https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple123/v4/1f/cb/7b/1fcb7b2c-151c-f518-223b-195493d4fa5a/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,Interactive Fiction PbtA,3.8 ‚Ä¢ 4 Ratings,$1.99,,"October 20, 2019","There‚Äôs a lot to like in The Mines of Immortia: good presentation, an engaging but not too serious writing style, and a fun mix of Choose Your Own Adventure style interactive fiction choice with the occasional randomness of the Powered by the Apocalypse skill check system. This game would also serve as a good demo for someone new to tabletop RPGs who wonders what a game of Dungeon World might be like.To the developer: this was a lot of fun! If you update this game or make another like it, please consider implementing the option for the player to save their progress. After my first few deaths I gave up on starting over all the way from the beginning. But this is a small issue in an otherwise enjoyable experience. To the mines! Success is almost entirely based on 2d6 die-rolls where actions fail on a roll of 6 or less which almost alway results in death.   With no bookmark/save function, you have to restart from the beginning after dying which becomes a real grind after only a few runs.  I appreciate the challenge of permadeath but not when it‚Äôs based almost entirely on RNG. That‚Äôs pretty fair criticism. Thank you for that. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something I can really fix in this game without a really serious systemic overhaul, but I‚Äôll definitely work on making future games fail forward more. "

Occasionally a few grammatical errors here and there but I still understand what they‚Äôre saying perfectly!!! I do wish the had a button so that you could restart a season but it‚Äôs fine i just get caught up in a story and then when waiting to earn more hearts I get caught up in another and forgot some of the story line for the first üòÖ that‚Äôs all my fault nothing to do with the app. And my favorite story is Astoria fates kiss!!! I wish they had a hades route!!! Could you make one eventually?? I just want to see how he‚Äôs like you know? Like if there is a tragic past or idk I guess I just like arguing with his character basically üòÖüòÇ I know that sounds weird but it‚Äôs entertaining to watch him get all high and mighty and then just kinda stop üòÇ any ways..... I love the app and highly recommend it!!!!! Oh and one more thing a lot of people get confused about Alex Cyprin‚Äôs physical gender and gender in general I feel like you should make some of the characters like Alex and JD‚Äôs gender more clear. I personally don‚Äôt really care about their physical gender and I don‚Äôt think most players care it‚Äôs just we get curious. Any way that‚Äôs most of my suggestions and opinions hope you read and consider them. The stories are great and really enjoyable! The only thing is that there are often a bunch of grammatical errors or certain parts that could use better wording, so you could really benefit from having a competent editor to make the stories even better. Then, there‚Äôs the whole issue with the hearts. I feel like a lot of the premium choices that cost hearts are too much. For instance, I chose a premium option that cost about 25 hearts (or something along those lines) when it should‚Äôve cost only 15 because the scene was so short. Most of the time it‚Äôs not even worth it, and I get disappointed about having spent my hard-earned hearts on such short scenes. I wish I could spend more hearts to read the premium scenes, but I want it to be worth my while.Also, the reward system (the daily rewards and the romantic quests) makes it hard and slow to earn hearts. I know that it‚Äôs a free game, and you have to earn money by getting people to buy tickets and hearts, but you should at least be reasonable. With Choices and Episode, you can earn diamonds and gems after each chapter you read. In Choices, you also get the option to watch ads to earn more diamonds. In Episode, the app has challenges where you can read whatever story you want, so you can earn more tickets and gems if you play consistently. So I rated the app 3 stars because I like the stories, but it would be better if the premium choices cost less or if the reward system changed. I've had this app for a few months now and I've explored the stories enough to really have a feel for all of them. I've played other apps like this one, but this one is by far the best! The stories are amazing and intense, with rarely a dull moment. I like all the MCs and they're even relatable. I love the art, but I do have to say that some of them can look a bit goofy at times. I've seen a lot of people complain about the tickets, but I don't see any issues with it. I've played games that have me wait 2+ hours for a ticket only for 3 minutes of readable content, whereas in this app the episodes are long and always have something to offer. I'm not a fast reader, more because I like to take my time, but it usually takes me about 10-15 to read each episode (like I said, some people may read faster than me). I'm okay with only getting two tickets because if I could I would spend hours reading the stories, since they are so good, but I've got life to move through. I do wish that it was easier to get hearts or that they would be less expensive, but they need to get the money somehow and I'm happy to contribute.Either way, I definitely recommend this app and my favorite storyline is Love & Legends (Saerys being my favorite and Reiner close behind <3)!

Then I started playing it and obviously it was going to have a little bit of a different gaming mechanic because it‚Äôs not hooked to key bindings but like a couple of the previous reviews. I think that you should bring back custom cosmetics by grinding or by login bonuses. Also that I don‚Äôt like that all the cosmetics are behind paywall which kinda ruins the game for me because one of my favorite things about Soulworker is the amount customization options there are. It makes you really stand out and you can customize your character to feel like you, that‚Äôs all I have to say. Keep it up and can‚Äôt wait to see what the future holds. I was pretty excited to make my own character but I'm sad to see all cosmetics are only obtainable using pink gems (paid currency), with the exception of some cosmetics available for trade but will only last 15 days. Hopefully later on there will be events in which I don't mind grinding for cosmetics. Good game so far. Would be nice if we don't have to do PvP in order to finish all daily bonus rewards. Will definitely stick around to see what else the devs have to offer. Hello mindyoursugarlv, thank you for your feedback about the game, we will forward it to our Team.

For example in mission of the ‚Äúold pirates secrates‚Äù u must give them 10k to stop chasing and there is no option for u to not to and end it by force.- also adding more states of the relationships between u and other kingdoms would be good because it gets boring just going around the map in every location freely. For example if u have really bad relation ship in specific kingdom u will be chased and will have to fight them or escape using some kinds of artifacts (which i hope will be added).- and lastly i would love if u could attack ports and be able to capture them making it ur investment and defend it from attackers. Which than u could supply with guns and ammos and materials which would be late game but still possible. Definitely the best pirate-themed game for the iPad (by a large margin).  Picture it as a very polished Sid Meier‚Äôs Pirates! but with 25x the missions, stronger graphics, a fantastic score and 100% less redundant ballroom dancing.So why only 4 stars instead of 5?In a word: land.  This game has about a half dozen land quest types (they rotate randomly).  And its during these quests where the polish is tarnished.  A prime example: on a mission to save an Emperor‚Äôs daughter, you run to a pirate haven to save her. Often, the haven doesn‚Äôt render until you‚Äôre in the middle of town where you promptly get blown apart or trapped in geography.  Likewise, some trees don‚Äôt render and you‚Äôll get stuck on them.  Perhaps the most common issue is the camera panning 180 degrees in the opposite direction of a fight because of some object behind you that you‚Äôre stuck on. Additionally, your pirate will move a bit oddly through the land missions as if on rails (randomly). If the developers could fix the issues with land quests (giving them the same polish as the vibrant sea battles), this game would be an easy 5 star winner and one of the best games on the iPad. UPDATE: With the newest update, my expectations have, indeed, been exceeded! 3rd person boarding and land missions are absolutely bonkers! Been on since day 1 and I hope this game NEVER dies! ORIGINAL:Supremely bummed to see my original review missing :( .   Anywho- this awesome pirate game is the best all-round free-roam pirate action RPG on the App Store! At first glance, simple mechanics and mission chasing are abound!      However, what most fail to see is the actual depth of the game. For starters, it's a social game that allows you to play with other people cooperatively or anonymously. You can also upgrade your crew AND captain. There are mysteriously powerful artifacts to find, mythical sea monsters, and a budget for all of it..so venture wisely. Otherwise, the graphics and camera angles matched with the realistic sounds give this game movie-like qualities...just zoom in on deck and sail for a while with your friends, it's a blast! Then cooperate in pirate battles...it's a literal blast!    Sixth Star!!! The 6th star goes to this game because the developers have gone above and beyond providing excellent customer service.

‚ÄéSomme Trench,"You're a fresh British infantryman at the Battle of the Somme, one of the longest, bloodiest battles of World War One.

Schaefer, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based‚Äîwithout graphics or sound effects‚Äîand fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.

Or you might give in to your inner demons and wind up chatting with ghosts and skeletons as though they're your friends. Whatever path you choose, you'll be immersed in a richly detailed, interactive historical novel that has almost as many twists and turns as there were soldiers at the Somme. ‚Ä¢ Immerse yourself in the world of the Western Front ‚Ä¢ Choose paths as diverse as infantryman, stretcher bearer or aircraft machine gunner ‚Ä¢ Learn about some of the most important events of world history ‚Ä¢ Challenge your mind ‚Ä¢ Enjoy a richly-detailed interactive novel with countless storylines ‚Ä¢ Solve mysteries embedded within the game",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple115/v4/43/b0/87/43b08784-e891-3e54-3691-f757853e5529/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-85-220-0-4.png/1200x630wa.png,,5.0 ‚Ä¢ 23 Ratings,$2.99,,"June 28, 2018","I downloaded this game for the first time over a year ago. I've played through dozens of ways and still find different paths. This is a great game I've never experienced anything like this. You can laugh and smile at somethings and at others be heartbroken. I still remember my first play through. I love this game and no matter what I've always comeback to it at some point. It was very well made. Just to point out how much I like it this is the only game I'll ever write a review on. I can't stress how amazing it is without spoiling it. Anyways. Just. Get it it's. Amazing to say the least. No just the fighting and all that just. Get it. You won't be disappointed in the least. The one problem I have with this game is that I've been playing it for the past 7 hours straight. I've played through many times. I've died probably 10 times (mostly within the first 10 mins of fighting). It's a great game which actually has a lot of replay value. It's really interesting to see how each job you can have ties together and how a couple different choices can so greatly affect who lives and dies. Must have game right here! This is the first interactive fiction game that I played on mobile and almost certainly remains the best.It captures the tone of the war excellently and allows the player to take decisions that make for very different playthroughs.If you enjoy this, Divided We Fall, about the Spanish Civil War, makes for a strong follow-up.

I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Looney tunes in my childhood, but this game makes me change my mind. It‚Äôs gameplay is good, it‚Äôs super competitive, and it is extremely addicting to play.,which leads to problems.I‚Äôm going to talk about the in-app purchases in each in game currency to tell the developers to fix these things, or they will ruin the game. The coins are no problem, they can be earned super easily. The ?illudium?‚Äôs purchases are ridiculous. They cost about 100 gems for 2 illudiumÔºÅIn perspective, you can spend 5 energy to get 2 illudium and a bunch of other items! The developers must be drunk when designing this market. Change this please!The energy system is way too expensive and way too little. I have to wait for like 2 hours to play it again. Maybe the energy cap raises as you level up? This way more people will play it. The daily tickets are fine, but I wish there would be more places to get them. The golden tickets...no, I am not spending any money on them, they are simply a place for new players to spend their money. Seriously, 200 gems for ONE golden ticket? I will never buy that.I seriously like this game, but it punishes free-players(including me) for not spending 50 dollars on some golden tickets. I‚Äôm sorry to see this game be like this, so please change these features! Sadly but not surprisingly, greed ruined another potentially amazing free to play game. The art and animation are wonderful, and it‚Äôs a really fun concept. Unfortunately, the free to play overlords in the company want your wallet more than your praises. I don‚Äôt like free to play models, but I accept them. This game, however, has only been out 2 weeks and is already geared for whales (big spenders). It uses special events (holidays, etc) as an excuse for you to spend more money rather than giving you much free stuff (what other free to play games do). Sure you can earn some, but they also offer tons of rewards you can‚Äôt possibly earn without paying real money. There is literally no way to reach them otherwise. And the gems you can earn for free don‚Äôt go very far at all. Everything you need in game currency for is way too expensive. I have paid money in other games with a much better rewards system, but I will not be spending a dime on this one unless something changes. And for a game that revolves around brawling with other players, it does a pretty terrible job at pairing you with a fair match most of the time. I may keep playing a little longer to see if the devs are listening, but for what could have been amazing, I feel pretty disappointed. Two stars, one for the animation team and one for the designers. None for the bigwigs who are way too greedy for a game that just came out. Great concept, wonderful characters, fun and addictive gameplay. However, store is a disaster as everything is way overpriced. 300 gems for 5-100 pieces of a character, cmon. At least 300 gems for most store items most of which you can get for free just by playing. In lower levels hundreds of trophies means a difference in your battles, but at higher levels I‚Äôm at least 3000 trophies higher than opponents and lose more than I win. Ages no sense. Crate system is awful and extremely flawed. Went to work with 4 crates under an hour to open. Came back and all were stolen. You never get to attack an opponent with less than an hour on a crate yet somehow you always can lose them no matter how much time you have left to open them. Constantly try to start brawls, it loads and then tells you the crate is already open. Then why is it an option to fight that opponent? This happens a LoT! This game could be awesome. Look at all my complaints and I still give it 3*! Small side complaint, where are classic characters like Speedy, Taz, Tweety, Henery Hawk? Wile E and Roadrunner are special characters only which is fine but we have a few obscure characters but not all the staples. Loads of potential lots of aggravation at higher levels. Just tired of losing to people thousands of points below me. "

But I was unable to beat it due to a game breaking glitch that stopped me from advancing and fighting the final boss. Can't recommend a game that's broken at such a critical point, sorry. Overall I'd say I like this game. Here are my likes and dislikes:Likes:1) the game has a creative way to show progression in ur character w/o leveling up2) the characters, monsters and game illustration is pretty cool3) the game and combat system are addictingDislikes:1) too much grinding (other raters have mentioned this as well)2) no sell back option in the shop. Once a card becomes obsolete its just a dead card in ur library3) a longer story would be nice. Minus all the grinding the game doesn't actually last that long. Suggestions:1) add in a sell back option at the shops. This kills the dead card and grinding options w/one stone2) add in more story driven side quests. This could add some depth to the main story3) add in some hidden cards. Perhaps single cards that are so strong only one exists. This could be a optional side quest that the player has to unlock. Also adds more length to the story, but as optional the player can choose to not do itAll-in-all great game! "

Her cub waddled up to her side, riding against her before settling down. Her partner was the alpha and sat beside her. The perfect image was to good to last. A pride was closing in, the females circled the den, clueless of them noticing their every move. Noah (the alpha male) triggered an alert to the females to protect the cubs. The rogue male that joined the pack a while ago made a quick escape, bailing out of the pride, not wanting to end his life today. The rogue‚Äôs alpha male walked up the slope that led to the den‚Äôs main room. Noah stepped down and before they could argue, they were on the ground fighting. Some of the lioness from the rouge pack attacked from behind. The alpha female gathered the cubs and shoved them behind a rock. Her soft nose pushed softly but swiftly and quickly enough for her to turn around and pin a lioness that was about to pounce.      After the fight, the rouge pack lost and only a couple of lionesses survived along with all the cubs. The alpha female and male were devastated and decided to move their pride to the soft-spoken plains with rolling hills and grazing gazelle. It will take them a few days to get their but it would be worth it. Long story short, they regained their pack‚Äôs health and let in new members. Their pack was now the strongest and could take on any pride any time of day.                             The End :) We should do a 101 Dalmatian game where you can play as cruella devil or the Dalmatians. If you play as the Dalmatians you would start out as an adult male or female and you would live with the couple and the maid and the you could have them take you for a walk. Then eventually you get a mate and then eventually you can have a puppy and another and another and another. And after 4, you could have eventually the option to type how many puppies you want. Or you could go to the pet store and adopt some puppies. And at night you could have your mate stay home and guard while you go to the pet store and try to save the dalmation puppies from cruella devil and the two guys. If you are asleep and your owners are asleep at your home and the two guys show up or are almost at your house then while you are asleep a visual will show up on the screen and will somehow represent an instinct, that should last a second. Then you choose wether you want them to take your puppies or if you want to protect them. After they take them you could give a sound alarm as a bark or a howl to all of the dogs in London. And then you could find them any way basically that you want. If you don't want to deal with cruella devil and the two guys you can have that option. And you can live a regular life. "

Honestly it‚Äôs rather boring. Every episode I did the exact same thing. New outfit, new hairstyle, and a new picture. Then off to the stage to do a routine that lasted less than a minute with three moves out of a selection of three or four for each style. After that get 4 stars (about 10 out of 15 times) and stand there in the same position and have the exact same reaction when one of the judges says something. Then I do it all over again. Once I got to the last about 3 episodes I suddenly failed every time after winning every single episode before. I get that it should be a little harder to win, but not that dramatic. The only reason I kept playing was to win the season, but I lost. I don‚Äôt have the want to to go though another 15 episodes of the same thing over and over and probably just lose again so I‚Äôm gonna delete. There is also extremely limited options. About 10 leotards, 4 hairstyles, only about 6 different pictures you could take, etc. Another thing that is really annoying is that you can‚Äôt practice so the only way to get better is on stage. Gymnastics Superstar is much better and I played it before they added all the other events. "

Much more an old style turn based jrpg. However there are a lot of flaws.  Many bosses and monsters really create a frustrating experience making the game not fun overall.  Many bosses and monsters just spam negative effects or area of effect spells, and you spend most of your time reviving, healing and curing with any surviving characters.  You will blow through many dungeons just to find a boss obliterate you in 3 turns.   Even if you level up or change/ level up classes your hp are still very low and negative status effects hit at a very high rate. Often one charm spell charms my entire party.   Many boss battles I just got lucky, and I can't seem to get lucky on the last boss who often spams 4 area effect spells killing your entire party in one turn, even with the best eq and maxed skills/spells. There also isn't a skip button for conversations, since you will be fighting some bosses 10+ times hoping to get lucky and win, hearing the same conversation every time is tedious.Overall I like the genie concept, and style of game (although I will say you will be frustrated with how many levels have spike/lava floors! Seems the level designers love damage floors) however the balance of the bosses and how spells and effects hit makes the game very frustrating and not enjoyable. Touch Controls + Small Screen + Spikes = Does not work well together. This game is alright on iPad display but is kind of a nuisance on the iPhone. Game plot and gameplay is good like the others. I know these are old games being translated but if any more are being released I think the plot of ""empire"" needs to discontinue for a bit. There is too many currently revolving around the ""empire"". "

Maybe at least photo booth shouldn‚Äôt be locked! We shouldn‚Äôt be forced to spend to much on a game. I have had other Coco games, and they too have the fun things locked. Please make that better! Also, when I race, an ad pops up right before the race! Does the game pause? No. The causes me to lose most of the time. Also when I race, I trip over things that aren‚Äôt even there! I mean wth! Enough ranting. Let‚Äôs go over the good parts of the game (or all that we have without paying). I love how you can make the clothes any color you want! Please put that feature on the accessories option. Also with dressing, please save the outfit so we don‚Äôt have to make a new one every time we reopen the game. Just about everything else is cute. But you have to wait to go back to the park for 11 FREAKIN HOURS!! 11!!! That‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ unacceptable. If it must be hours, make it 1 or 2. The eating animations are sweet (the lemon one is so cute and funny). From this review you see the app needs to be fixed. But also this app is cute and fun (again, fun with all you have without paying). Devs, please fix the app problems I have said. Thank you, have a blessed day. I had this game when I was 7 and then I got locked out of my phone I forgot about this game but the song still stuck in my head I have been trying to figure out where I had learned that tune and then I was playing another one of coco‚Äôs games an ad came on of the game and I was like that‚Äôs the tune I was singing!!! That was my favorite game when I was little!!!! Omg I have to ask my mom and dad if I can get this game again!!!! So I did and I got it again!!! I was sooooo happy!!! And I have not stopped playing! At the time when I saw the game for the first time in forever, I was at my grandmas! Haha!!! Coco always has the best games! And can‚Äôt wait to see what they come out with next!!!!üòäbut also one thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that you have to watch ads to get things and how you have to spend that much on the game just to unlock other things! It‚Äôs just a game and you wanna have fun playing it! I do enjoy it but I don‚Äôt enjoy having to spend so much we should be able to do anything without having to spend so much money some people need that money on food or spend it on there house and what ever electronics they are using to play the game and then it‚Äôs not AS fun as it is when you can do anything. We want to be able to do everything without having to spend money!       Sincerely,               One of your gamers I like how you can design your pony but I wish you could make them talk or you could do more than just racing your pony it‚Äôs not the funnest game you could ever have but it at least it‚Äôs a Way to pass the time it‚Äôs not that hard so like five-year-olds Could play it and it‚Äôs not the baddest game in the world I just wish they put more effort into making the game the game is not so fun in the game was not so boring and made me feel weird because my pony kept jumping around and it was so creepy I don‚Äôt like how the pony smile it‚Äôs creepy I wish the wings were bigger and I wish you had more options for clothes and I wish you didn‚Äôt have to pay for the spy or the clenchIt to be a free game for everyone to play and you don‚Äôt have to pay for anything unless it‚Äôs like for getting me more food or buying more money or something this game stinks sometimes with all the ads it makes me want to grab my iPad and slam it on the wall please turn down the ads they‚Äôre annoying PS your games are totally fun sometimes but also totally annoying with the Reminders hopefully you make ones for animals or hunting games or even games from American girls dolls.

I do love the Bartholy family with all my heart, but I really wanted a story outside of their household. This story had a strong start, and led me to believe that she was on her own. Perhaps living in an apartment. But when she dropped that she lives with them, then I knew that the same old was coming. I know they are the main family of this universe, but perhaps in Sebastian‚Äôs story, we could actually be enemies/strangers to the Bartholys. See them from a different perspective. Or even keep them away from being the main focus and still have their powerful influence over the city. Have more conflicts. Maybe it‚Äôs because I have read all the other stories and it all seems the same. If we do end up leaving for that internship with Sebastian then I‚Äôll probably be surprised and change my view. Until then, let‚Äôs see what Sebastian has in store for us. üö®üö®üö® UPDATED: It seems my questions have been answered! The Bartholy boys are NOT the main focus, and it‚Äôs kinda sweet! Not the same old! I am enjoying this story quite a lot and brings me back to the excitement when I first met Drogo. I am super excited to read more and more! It is not as predictable and it‚Äôs definitely more sensual so beware younger crowd!!!! üö®üö®üö® Energy is the same ‚Äúpay to read ahead‚Äù system so I am not bothering complaining about that. ‚ù§Ô∏è I just recently discovered otome games because... well, Shelter in Place. This was the best of all of them! Great story, gorgeous graphics, likeable heroine (smart, not stupid; sensible, not rash), and a very sexy hero... who is nice, not an egotistical a-hole! What I liked best was that the story included details about archeology and myths, which fits with the story line. There‚Äôs also plenty of mystery. It‚Äôs not just another shallow romance churned out quickly. Too bad it‚Äôs so expensive to read at a reasonable pace. You need ‚Äúenergies‚Äù to read. You get 300 a day, which doesn‚Äôt roll over to the next day. That gets you about 15 sentences! Believe me, that goes quickly, which is especially frustrating when you‚Äôre at the part when the heroine is just mulling over what just happened. You can win extra energy by playing a mini game once a day, but you can only get 160 max if you watch an ad. I bought $20 worth of energy today and I couldn‚Äôt even get through 1 chapter... not even close. And there are 11 chapters. Do the math! At the amount you get to read each day without spending a bunch of money, you‚Äôll start to forget what happened just a chapter ago. The author, Claire Zamora has her own books and I would rather read those. Unfortunately, they‚Äôre only in French. I absolutely adore this game , and find it incredibly interesting. The story and characters itself are great!! I like how this story has more of twist on it than the others!! THOUGH, the energies that you get each day run out way too quickly. Now you are probably saying, buy more, which is understandable. I understand that the company needs money, but at the rate that the energies, run out , it would completely exhaust what I can afford. It‚Äôs fact you have to pay so much to advance , it‚Äôs not worth it. I have read many reviews similar to mine and they pay ( Which I have no problem with, as long as you get your money‚Äôs worth), and they are left unsatisfied.I think that the 300 energies you get each day should make the story and dialogue lays a little longer. The only interesting part I got through so far is Sebastian in the forest, the I have been stuck in and out of his class, because I ran out of energy. I‚Äôm just wondering how much more do I have to stop to get to the next part of the story.. As a new player that completely adores this game, I hope my thoughts are heard, and hopefully answered..Thank you for your time is you read this. I hope it gets heard. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth less than five minutes of gameplay. Please listen to your audience.... "

‚ÄéEncounter Challenge Calc,"Determining what constitutes an appropriate challenge for your party of heroes can be a real chore.  This app handles all the math for you, including modifiers for creature count and number of characters, so you can spend more time planning your adventure. First, describe the character levels that comprise your party.  The app can handle any reasonable number of characters, at levels up to 20.  You could, for example, specify that your party is made up of three level-4 characters, one level-5 character, and one level-6 character.  Once your party is defined, the app will tell you the XP thresholds appropriate for challenges of easy, medium, hard, and deadly difficulties. Those thresholds become the basis for a couple of other features: Creature Count per CR, and Custom Encounter Difficulty. Creature Count per CR is essentially a quick-reference chart which shows you the maximum number of creatures of each Challenge Rating that you can throw at the party to generate encounters of various difficulty.  For example, suppose you want the 5-member party described above to have a Hard encounter with some Challenge 2 creatures, such as ogres.  The chart will tell you that you'll need to use 4 of those creatures. Custom Encounter Difficulty is a calculator that allows you to define an encounter that consists of multiple, mixed CR creatures, and then tells you the difficulty of that encounter.  To illustrate, consider again our 5-member example party.  Using the Custom Encounter Difficulty calculator, you can create an encounter consisting of one CR1, two CR2, and one CR3 creatures, and it will tell you that this constitutes a hard encounter worth 3,600 XP.",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple7/v4/03/c3/a0/03c3a0c3-c1e0-4a77-e54a-97b2ecc9733f/pr_source.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.0 ‚Ä¢ 2 Ratings,$0.99,,"August 1, 2015","Not bad, much easier than doing it manually.

The graphic and sound design are phenomenal, and the game itself is a blast. However, it does have its share of problems. Almost everything has a daily limit, and I feel this limit is too strict. Sometimes, it makes some sense with hunts and the portal, but there‚Äôs already an energy system in the game. Only being able to do each hunt 5 times a day is fine because there‚Äôs multiple hunts to do, and the portal because one doesn‚Äôt want the player to achieve all of the rewards so fast. However, I believe the limit system should be used for each individual favor, portal battle, etc. instead of a total limit. The current system is way too restricting and makes the game much grindier as one has to wait a day to do certain things. The limit system is sometimes fine on its own, however with the energy system it is ridiculous. The only time the two systems come together is for hunts which is fine, but the portal, monster cave (which I think the torches for entering are too rare), favors, and others shouldn‚Äôt be this restricting. I also believe the energy system should be a little faster. Other than that, good game. This is a fantastic game, hence everyone else‚Äôs responses, but I wish the hunts made sense. I just recently got into the game as I mean it just came out but it really seeps into the idea of pay to win. Which I mean you don‚Äôt have to but to get anywhere or progress you do, the weapon development//upgrading is already beginning to feel very grind-like (which I don‚Äôt necessarily mind) but the issue is it doesn‚Äôt pay off well. Even after referring back to hunts when progressing into the game 6 turns is ridiculous, I was even tempted to pay (which I don‚Äôt mind either but I don‚Äôt want to pay for something in which the money I spend is going to require me to end up spending kore to catch up.) all in all I love the game but it‚Äôs lacking the engaging experience of progression through earning and I feel like it falls short for that reasoning. I‚Äôm personally going to continue to play but just like clash royale eventually the money grab will get on my nerves and rather than wanting to pay I won‚Äôt pay at all. I needed a new mobile game in which I just hope these little issues can be reduced and the game could be one of the best games to be released on the App Store. I just hope the devs are actually listening and aren‚Äôt trying to monetize as bad as candy crush was. Godspeed and I hope the best for this game.üôèüèΩ Love this game so much that many ideas started sprawling everywhere in my mind, I have a couple of them or two. The first one is since I found out that there‚Äôs a samurai hero in this game and I love samurai very much here‚Äôs this: involve a far eastern part of the world of knighthood, where you can meet the different version of the knights of rage, why not put the samurai of virtue: they master the art of virtues and allows them to summon yokai from their sword called yokai-no-tsurugi. And the second one is one that could make anybody love it more is that they should involve before I say this well I know in many fantasy genre we are treated to dragon knights and all that, nothing personal about that so here‚Äôs one type of knight you would love, the Dino knights! Awesome idea right? I think that be amazing enough to have into knighthood. I mean I‚Äôm thinking about the Dino might rage gauntlet, Dino knight heroes, dinosaur type monsters and all, trust many dinosaur fans are going to love that so much without a doubt. So what do you think? Impressed? Intrigued? Amazed that such an idea came to mind? Cause let me tell ya, it amazed me too when that came to me. "

It really should have more people playing it! I already played it before and I‚Äôm getting into it again because I have enough storage for it (I‚Äôm running low on storage at the moment so even smaller apps are hard to get right now). Basically this game is a type of tapping game, I really love it! The overall storyline is super cute and its fun to play and if your on a road trip, airplane flight etc. it is a great game to play! I am incredibly surprised that it‚Äôs not super popular right now! I like how also the types of creatures you fight aren‚Äôt always easy and that the game is actually challenging! Thanks so much for making this app! I really love it! Will definitely continue to play it as time passes bye :3! Keep up the good work! I‚Äôm going to probably add on to this review seeing that I have only been playing again for a little while because as I said I downloaded it again! :3 Love! ‚ù§Ô∏èThe art style, the fish, and collectible skins are all so very cute and the story/ game play is enjoyable as well.  I‚Äôve been using this game as a productivity app; since it needs to be running for you to fish and offers an auto/ black screen mode, I have found myself trying to use my phone less and getting more work done ever since playing itüòÇ There are regular monthly events on repeat but I look forward to new events in the future. In any case, I only high praises for this game; I love it so much!! Don‚Äôt get me wrong I really love this game, but when you want to ride your boats to places it‚Äôs really frustrating. I wish that you could just simply click one button and then you would be teleported there. Now I understand that some people like to fish at that time, but I usually don‚Äôt. So if you would be so kind to have the OPTION to teleport there that would be fantastic! Thank you for reading this and have a wonderful day! "
‚ÄéDemon's Rise,"*** Touch Arcade's RPG Reload Golden Poncho Winner 2015 (Top 5 Best Original RPG's of 2015) *** Rated 4 out of 5 Stars - ""The sheer variety and amount of things to do and play around with outclass most of the game's peers in this genre."" ~ Touch Arcade *** Top 10 Best New Games List on MacLife.com Requires an iPhone 5, iPad Mini 3, or iPad 3 or later - will not run on earlier devices. Enter the depths of the ancient city of Angor and prepare for battle.  Form a mercenary party of adventurers, sell swords, rogue sorcerers and assassins and enlist with an army of Dwarves trying to retake their ancient homeland.  Fight in a brutal campaign against goblins, undead, ratmen and the demon lords they worship.  Demon's Rise is a turn-based tactical game where players must lead a party of six heroes through the bowels of an underground city.  Battles are intense affairs where the proper use of terrain and cover is as important as the choice of spell or attack.  BATTLES:  Fight through 35 grueling campaign levels and another 51 patrol missions. CHARACTERS:  Choose a band of six heroes from 30 playable character classes.  Each class has unique strengths, weaknesses and special abilities. REWARDS:  Uncover the treasures of the old kingdom ... find gold or thousands of possible weapons, pieces of armour and artifacts.  Equip them to make your heroes stronger or sell them off and buy something more fitting. EXPERIENCE:  As your heroes fight, they gain experience, level up and unlock powerful new spells and abilities. COVER / TERRAIN:  Position is key to victory.  Place your heroes behind cover for protection or next to a magical shrine for extra power. MORALE:  Your heroes and their enemies may panic when they see the battle go badly or enter a berserker fury if they see an ally cut down.  Form a tight battle line where your stronger heroes can lend courage to the weaker ones and use intimidation as a weapon against your foes. ABILITIES:  Wizards can launch fireballs, cast protective wards or summon powerful monsters to their aid.  Illusionists can trick their enemies into switching sides or make them panic without reason.  Mighty warriors can make powerful weapon strikes, become berserk or heal themselves during battle.  All 30 player classes and many of the enemies you will encounter can perform such abilities and can use them to turn defeat into victory. Demon's Rise is a traditional game with NO IN-APP PURCHASES or unfair ""pay to win"" mechanics.  Victory is earned through courage, strength and tactics and not additional spending.   * Requires an iPad 3, iPhone 5, iPad Mini 2 or higher.",https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/a5/ae/a8/a5aea857-5f08-4657-3a1c-dfb07eb41c58/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-85-220-5.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.3 ‚Ä¢ 42 Ratings,$7.99,,"December 12, 2017","Good start. Def worth the .99 I paid. Would like to see more content, but there's a 2. Not many games like this avail for ios. Small dev, has updated. No in-app crap. Music and voices became annoying, utilized option to turn down. Like having double speed for combat. I'll probably get tagged for this, but keep up the attractive female characters. Support.Camera update fixed the rotation prob. No top down tho, unless on screen controls selected.Reply to dev:Impressive, timely response. Confirm top down controls fixed - ui interface no longer needed. Load times appear to have improved. Continue to replay w/ diff classes. No glaring ai or randomizer imbalance presenting yet. Add 1/2 star.Would like to see these games evolve. Some suggestions: base and army build, random encounters, choice affect world, economy, factions, character depth and interaction, battle damage, visible gear. I reinstall just so I can leave a review, although I've been in the game a while back it's still one of the best I've played on mobile.  No by gem or gold scams; fun turn based tactical combat in a fantasy setting. Plenty of content and characters.  I was a little disappointed when it ended abruptly; looking at the map it appeared that I had only finished one territory of what looked like a huge map.   I'm not sure if the developer planned on adding additional campaign areas (I would have paid for extra content!) but at this point I don't think it's happening.  The game as it stands however is well worth the money. I own all three titles by this developer and can say this is the most polished.  If you like fantasy tactics, definitely pick it up and consider the other titles by the same developer. Love these games from wave light. Hours and hours of strategy. Tried the game on easy and won, but moving up to normal makes the game a real chess match. Don‚Äôt over extend your troops in battle or expect them to die. Best part is you don‚Äôt have to pay anything more than the price of the game. I will definitely buy all of wave light games future sequels of this game "

Some things that should be improved: - Battles are missing interaction, I believe an option to make Oves only attack when and who you tell them to (basically, having control of the battle) would be a nice feature.- Ultimate skill animations are rough even on 60fps.- The room feature needs to be polished, the poor quality of the chibi Oves and the fact that they have no reactions to touch other than being dragged around makes the room a boring feature.Other than that, this game is great! Do give it a chance. "

I pre ordered it and it was installed on my phone the day it came out I enjoyed it the game is something new I like the idea of transcendence and I like how the game has a lot thing to do. There are only a few things I want to talk about in the game. Number one the pvp mode I liked the idea but now that I‚Äôm on the second map every time I enter I end up getting destroyed and I have a all UR party so it confused me on how I kept getting owned. Finally the last thing that I think needs work on is the pet system I think u should add more pets and make them easier to get or adleast make pets obtainable in another way then the pvp coins. But other then that I love this game it‚Äôs fun, new ,and different. Keep up the work u guy thanks for the fun game üëçüëçüëç Awesome game, every aspect is amazing. If I didn‚Äôt have to close the app 100 times a day to get the ads to load, I‚Äôd say this game is the perfect time-killing, entertaining, end-all application!!Edit: the ads are more consistent, and today I noticed an auto play (idle feature) that wasn‚Äôt there before... still loving the game and appreciate the adaptations the devs have already made- keep it up!! I‚Äôve been having a fun time with the game. I do enjoy that you have a lot of extra things to work on and increase as in many idle games. However here it does feel like I am having more of an impact working on crafting gear mid fights, looking at rarities and the ability to transfer over abilities from different characters is nice. It means you can level up teams you like and if you say get some ultra rare character that you really enjoy you can take abilities from the character that you‚Äôve been leveling as well as their gear (if they are of the same class) meaning all your hard work is not essentially reset. A fun game and honestly pretty much the only idle game that I‚Äôve ever been able to get into. Enjoying it so far! "
‚ÄéParadigm City,"The Golden Age of heroes is over, but you're just beginning. Will you use your powers to help the world or help yourself? Set on a near-future Earth that has been irrevocably altered by the arrival of superhumans, the world has been dealing with a radical shift in the nature of humanity. For thirty years, those with world-altering powers - referred to as capes - have been at the forefront of the world's media. There has been heroes, there has been villains, and there has been world-shattering confrontations when those two groups came into contact. For a time, those individuals walked the world like modern deities. For a time, it was good. But things change. Given time, all things resolve to entropy. The Golden Age is over. The player, a member of the newest graduating class of an international academy for powered individuals, needs to find their place in this new world, and whether that place will be determined by their own hand - or by the machinations of others. Assigned to the troubled Paradigm City, it'll be up to the player to determine whether their name becomes a byword for fame or infamy, idealism or pragmatism, and loyalty or ambition.

If you make a certain choice that ends in you battling the Maekir unit, and decide to ""take down"" Jotun and arrest them all, the story hiccups to the option where you kill Jotun after some writing that makes no sense both order and option wise. Would really appreciate a fix, thank youEdit: soon after writing this, after having killed Jotun unwillingly, I chose the option to troubleshoot Anima and the writing makes it sound as if she killed Jotun instead, probably something that happens if you make different choices? Anyways, just another problem, thanks. With the quality of latest hosted games I didn't have much hope for this one but it surprised me. It was well written and the story was pretty good. I actually enjoyed it very much. Doesn't have a very high replay value however it is lengthy and well executed. Worth every penny. I don't think there'll be a sequel but I would love to see one "

D. D. It's a lot of fun being that you progress so quickly and always level up so you feel good at the game even when you're new and when the game does get tough you just Prestige then your power more powerful than before. There is A lot of content for such a simple game even if you live a busy life style your character continues to play even when you're not actively playing.  I recommend you try it out.  I guarantee you will love it. I've played for over a year and still continue to move up and put up a good contest in tournaments. Plus it's free and the in game purchases don't make you that strong so they're not necessary. So may the BEST man win not the RICHEST. I really want to love this game, and do love many aspects of it, but even after numerous communications to the developers (with only limited and extraordinarily slow response in return) I remain immensely frustrated by the effect of hacker/cheaters in tournaments, and especially the extremely obvious ones in the Heroes Tournaments!Better rule enforcement is needed to prevent individuals from exceeding the limits of normal gameplay to rise to the top of the tournament roster with end-game levels within the first hour or two of the tournament, and clearly with several times the scores of the best normal players below them. I have screenshots from numerous tournaments that clearly demonstrate that this is happening, and continue to forward them to the developers, but without any apparent concern on their part to update Tap Titans against the hacks, now that Tap Titans 2 is out. It is totally unfair to all the players who are trying to play the original game fairly!Unfair play aside, this game has many worthy attributes, and would otherwise be worthy of a top rating. Developers, please fix the hacker problem, for as long as this shameful situation continues, it stands as a black mark against your prowess as programmers, and lowers our interest in any of Game Hives's other offerings! It's a pretty good time waster. It's fun pushing the limit to see how far you can get before you prestige. Each time you prestige, you get X amount of relics. The amount of relics you earn is based off of your characters level, your group level, and the stage in the game you reach. You use the relics to buy artifacts which give you a variety of bonuses such as additional damage, or more dropped gold while playing. It's a pretty fun game, but can get boring. When it gets boring for me, I just let my characters grind for me offline, and when I open the game again, level them up, advance to a stage proportionate to my team's strength, and close the game. So either way you want to play, I think it's fun. I did buy the lowest possible amount of diamonds to get rid of the ads, so it makes the game a little more bearable. One final bit, I would not recommend spending diamonds on anything except buying things for your character, and there's no need to actually spend cash for diamonds. You get plenty of free ones in game through drops, events, ads, and weekly login awards. "

The gameplay is beautiful AND challenging. You do NOT have to pay to win. I haven‚Äôt paid a dime and I‚Äôve played the game as far as it‚Äôs been developed as well as leveled up my character build to nearly unbeatable. Honestly my only complaint is the newer levels haven‚Äôt been released yet. An unrelated suggestion would be to create dynamic levels (outside of the storyline) that are longer to allow more hacking and slashing. Could be randomly generated, loot-laden, levels that still allow people to enjoy the game after the storyline is done. Did you find the title to this review incomplete? I promise you it‚Äôs more complete than this game is... there‚Äôs really no point in calling it a pay to win because you can‚Äôt win something that isn‚Äôt finished yet. What happens is you get drawn in by the stunning graphics and gameplay mechanics, you have a little bit of fun so you shell out some real money to level up and become strong enough to see the rest of the game...then when you click to advance to the next chapter in the game and test out your newly purchased might, you're met with a shadowed out screen that says coming soon. It‚Äôs been saying that for over a year. I contacted the company on FB and they assured me that new updates were fixing to roll out... since then several updates have come but literally the only thing that changed about the game was its icon picture... all its 4 hours of gameplay never changed a bit. The latest update won‚Äôt even load. It keeps freezing on first load screen! This has been the case for an entire year! No additional updates or content, just a chance to throw your $$ away. This game has very smooth graphics and really diverse and interesting magic skills. I didn‚Äôt have to pay a cent and I was able to reach level 37 and beat the game (they say one more final chapter is ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù in an update). Like others said the problem is that there is nothing to do now. All my items are already maxed out and since I‚Äôm not spending money, there‚Äôs no way to get better items, nor do I need better items to advance anyway. The loot in the challenge ladder is simply not that interesting. And finally yes, there is one skill only available through gems that that is totally OP and lets you dominate. The way as a free player you can occasionally ‚Äútaste‚Äù this and other skills is by sharing other (paying) people‚Äôs avatars.All in all a good game that has an abrupt end and needs a more satisfying endgame set of things to do.

Another thing is that your character turns super I mean super slow!!! To follow up on that the graphics are terrible and no work at all was put into making it a good games the mirrors don‚Äôt work the spacing is way to far it‚Äôs not realistic and a trillion other things!!! And the second to last thing I say is that while you cut hair you can‚Äôt turn your screen!!! Last for me it wasn‚Äôt a problem because I play barber games all the time is that it didn‚Äôt have a tutorial all though some people may really need it so I highly recommend that you never ever get this game!!!üò°üò°üò°üòíüòíüòí‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏èüëéüëéüëé At first I thought oh wow this game might be really cool because I like 3D stuff.

The English subtitles are off and incorrect. The characters are very well created but stagnant and don‚Äôt coincide with what they are doing in the storyline. The parts (18+) are censored. There are not options aside from character choices. This looks like a great start to a gaming app but it just seems very unfinished. I‚Äôd like to see how the developer updates the app in order to make it more successful! I think I may have preordered this, because I don‚Äôt remember downloading it. But I just tried it and it was quite entertaining. It has a very intriguing vibe. It has some charming issues with its English, but quite understandable. I was left wanting more. It seems more like the introduction to a more intricate story, I would hope there is a follow up to this because it was so short, but the experience provides for quite a good time. The story as given is also somewhat perfect as it is, with a good stopping point. It‚Äôs great at evoking mixed emotions.Tl;dr: this is so short that if you are even slightly less than completely opposed to playing it, you should play it. Great vibe, Love it! When I saw the bad review I got curious about playing so I downloaded. Yes I admit it I wish we could at least put our names for a more personal story. Something to really draw us into the story. However i still loved it very much and I really hope you can make another one. If the creator is reading please make another one cause you got me wanting more and by the looks of things you got other people wanting more too. Just one change and i hope you can do it is to allow us to use our names to personalize the story. "

It takes so long it gets boring in my opinion, then you have guild battles and you can't never participate because the game doesn't load off the guilds who haven't been on in like 89 days. I've been trying to join or create a guild but it's not happening. Don't get me wrong this is a excellent game if you want time consumption but work more than one job you won't have much time at all. Plz fix these issues I greatly appreciate it. It has major potential if they get it right. If you can make a newer version with the camera right behind the player and more options than just one button too attack with staff you could charge for it plus fix these other issues my other players have complained about. Thanks a bunch. Since April 7th/8th 2020, I haven‚Äôt been able to get past the ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù portion of the loading screen on startup. I was hoping it was a quick fix on GL‚Äôs part. Checked the support page and did everything that they suggested (and more) to try and resolve the issue myself to no avail. I thought, ‚Äúalright, I‚Äôll submit a ticket to customer care and they‚Äôll fix it.‚Äù It‚Äôs nearly been a week now and I haven‚Äôt gotten an answer aside from the automated message that tells me to do the same things I‚Äôve already tried several times. I had purchased a few packs to help out with the (then) upcoming guild war and Easter egg hunt event; only to find that I can‚Äôt take part in either of them. I have to say I‚Äôm very disappointed and lost a lot of faith in Gameloft. I used to love so many of their mobile games but lately it just seems like they‚Äôre trying to rush out spotty updates to keep players on their toes and hopefully, to the developers, digging in their wallets. Normally I would rate this 4/5 stars, solely knocking one because of the p2w factor. However, with Gameloft seeming to CARE less about CUSTOMER CARE, I stand by my rating of 2/5 and would not recommend this, and many other of their games to anybody. A quick side note: I have read of many instances in online forums of this same issue happening multiple times through the past. You would think they could have sorted it out much more easily. There will never be a dungeon hunter game as good as the first 2 games, and they have been LONG gone and trapped in the past due to neglect. They were beautiful single player story driven games. I can‚Äôt even tell you the countless hours I‚Äôve spent in dungeon hunter 1, 2, and dungeon hunter alliance for the ps3 and psvita. Dungeon hunter 3 was okayyyyy but definitely a downgrade, then dungeon hunter 4 released. It was a combination of a good story driven single player experience with a multiplayer OPTION. And now you‚Äôve gone full circle with your latest releases. There are countless paywalls in the new games. I miss being able to just play a game. I can‚Äôt do that anymore. I have to PAY a game now. Hopefully you come to your senses and release a real game, but like most game companies/publishers nowadays, you probably never will. Its a shame, really. Dungeon hunter 2 is my favorite mobile game of all time. I played that game so much to the point where I memorized every single aspect of the game. (Glitches, chest locations, ways to do things more quickly and efficiently, farming locations) and there‚Äôs nothing fun about the new games anymore because none of those unique experiences are possible anymore.

Just pick a few items for our protagonist Sosuke to put in his backpack for the day, and off he'll go to explore. When he returns, he'll regale you with tales of his adventures. From bug-hunting to beaches to friends to family‚Äîmany stories both sad and sweet await you. So put on that swimsuit, collect everything under the sun, and come share an unforgettable summer with Sosuke and a wide cast of characters! Oh, and of course, this game is free to play from start to finish! --------------------------- Story --------------------------- Ah, summer break, and those lazy days of carefree fun in the sun! A time for adventure, yes, and a time to forge unforgettable memories, too. This is the tale of one boy's summer on a small rural island near Shikoku. It is a story of surprising encounters and melancholy goodbyes.

It was very cute, very relaxing, but also very riling. The game play was really nice. I thought the fact that Sosuke chose when he wanted to leave was nice. That way it didn‚Äôt really feel like an obligation, but that he/you really wanted to explore these places. I use he/you that way, because this game REALLY DOES make you invested in it and like want to go to these different places. See what they‚Äôre like. Plus the storyline. Ugh, don‚Äôt even get me started. It was so- Cool! That‚Äôs the only other way I can put it. I personally, was hoping that Sosuke would decide to stay on the island where he‚Äôs happy, but he does need to be with his mother. I feel like I also learned things that he learned with him. He really learned to understand her better and I think that was a really nice idea for it. I genuinely cried at the end, though. Seriously developers. I was in search of a nice game that I wouldn‚Äôt get tired of. And that was this. Though it was short, it brightened my day every time!!! So 1) Thank you and 2) Great job. This was perfect in my eyes. <3 Having played the other games of this developer, I must say this is their best work yet. They clearly put a lot of love and effort into their games. The games are not much in gameplay and are almost all about the story (much like a visual novel game), which I throughly appreciate. This one in particular is very relatable and hits so close to home! I highly recommend for anyone and everyone to play this game. You won‚Äôt regret all those peaceful minutes you spend in the beautiful world. It has some sad moments, some happy ones, and some funny ones too! Everything you need for an emotional adventure is right here in this little game. Please feel free to pick it up and support the amazing developers! This game is a true stress reliever- it‚Äôs simple to play with an engaging story that doesn‚Äôt force you or manipulate you into buying anything to actually play. There is a power up that makes the game completely effortless to play and there are occasional ads that give you rewards, but they‚Äôre inconsequential and not really needed unless you‚Äôre trying to speed through the game. I finished this game in about a week, maybe less, and I honestly wish it were a bit longer only because I was having so much fun. 100% recommend this game, along with the developers earlier titles such as the Showa Candy Shop series.

‚ÄéWeldBoss AR Welding Game,"Exciting augmented reality game that simulates real world STICK and TIG welding. Play this game to learn how to weld, or test your existing welding skills.   Just open this app and point your phone a suitable flat surface that automatically becomes your welding bench.  Augmented Reality detects flat surfaces in the camera view.  Sufficient light and a flat surface required!  When a surface is detected a button to add virtual objects appears. The weldable virtual objects magically appear in your camera preview as if they were real objects. Welding sounds and the metallic surfaces of the objects are so real, you will forget they are virtual objects. Pan, pinch and make rotate gestures on your phone's screen to move the virtual objects around the real world camera view. To weld, use the add button to select the ""Stick Electrode"".  This attaches the welding electrode to your camera's view in ""First Person"" perspective.  Now, your phone is the electrode. Move your phone  towards objects and the electrode moves towards the objects as if it were attached to your phone. Touch the electrode to a virtual object by looking at your phone screen, and moving the phone towards where object appear until the sparks, sounds and welding beads magically appear. Sdd multiple objects and weld them together into your own creations! Download the app to train, practice or just show off your technique. This app is screen record enabled.  Press the red ""R"" button to record your welding and share the video with friends. (Record button flashes while recording and a second tap stops recording and saves a video to your photo album.)",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple128/v4/9b/6f/f0/9b6ff045-9ffc-fcc1-7dd1-79b27353f63d/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-P3-0-0-0-85-220-0-0-0-6.png/1200x630wa.png,Stick/TIG Welding Simulator,2.7 ‚Ä¢ 61 Ratings,Free,,"July 17, 2018","To start with this game is something cool but, it does need a few upgrade. One take away the time this could use to recreate projects before doing them. Two this is a good app just that it would lag out for some reason and freeze then unfreeze. Is an app with potential for other uses just need a little of work Thanks for leaving a review.  I made the app several years ago when apple first added world tracking ability to the phone that allowed developers to place virtual objects into camera views and let users interact with the objects.  I don't really have time to further develop the app but hope it offers people a realistic simulation of welding. I love this app, I use it in my spare time when I have nothing to do, sometimes I even use it in public and people think I look retarded moving my phone around in such a way. Even though I love using this app (despite the unrealistic welding experience)There is one fatal flaw...the time limit, I honestly wish the time limit was gone or could be set to a certain time or set it to unlimited time. But over all great game I‚Äôd definitely recommend it to my freinds. Thanks for using the app.  I did not anticipate how many people would hate the time limit. I am not sure I have time to make an update but adding a practice mode is at the top of my list for why to make an update. Hey this game is really awesome and fun I mean it‚Äôs not really accurate to how welding is but eh I‚Äôll give it a passing grade.But you should consider adding more to it like pipe welding or angles or something along those lines making the game more realistic. But why can I only weld a tiny bit? I mean it‚Äôs fun and all but I can only weld for like 3 seconds and then it‚Äôs over...and you can‚Äôt even get another rod it‚Äôs like you have to start over. I think you should be able to weld more and you should add more things onto the game :) Overall awesome game and I‚Äôm looking forward to getting updates and (I‚Äôll pay if I have to, to get more things to do and weld in the game.) Keep up updating it and I‚Äôll keep playing and posting about it on Instagram :D I wish I could see you using the app.  I think you are just not having a steady enough contact to maintain the arc.  There is not a 3 second time limit.  Also, you can select square or round tube(pipe) or a flat plate.  You can even select multiple pieces and weld them together.

I added one more star for finally fixing what was broken, withholding a star because this game is clearly not getting love from the localizers. -------------------------------This is a great game, but unfortunately an incomplete product. There are 2 bugs I've encountered: one where none of the St. Maryanne's Academy name tags are recorded, and the other is that the game crashes in EX Chapter 5. Please fix these, and I'll throw in the other 2 stars this game deserves. I'm not into Anime, nor am I into top down retro games like this, I switched playing this On a PSP emulator right before my laptop bit the dust and got as far as the end of the first chapter. It moved me enough to buy and play the game on my phone, and I find myself liking it as much as I like the Witcher 3 or Fallout 4. These games are absolutely not similar though. I really enjoy the story. I can't say why ""spoilers"" voice acting, though be it in Japanese, is great. As you read along with the voice, it feels like the actor speaks English, definitely recommend This is basically the exact same game as the PSP Version, but a few things... bother me. One: the typeface is set to either Arial or Times New Roman, one of the two. It doesn‚Äôt really look good at all. Two: The game is seemingly locked at like, 300 FPS. Everything is way too fast, to the point where the Wrong End screen gets cut off VERY fast. Otherwise, it‚Äôs the same game with relatively few changes. "
‚ÄéEmber,"About Ember ‚ÄúBack in the earliest days, there was no sun and the world was dark. The heavens opened up and stars fell like beacons into the pitch black world, and they were known as ‚ÄúEmbers‚Äù. Powerful and wise druids of a primordial race, ‚Äúthe Lightbringers,"" roamed the orb searching for this luminous matter. They performed a ritual of awakening to call the ‚ÄúEmbers‚Äù out of their deep sleep. Suddenly the world became bright, and the veil of darkness was lifted. The Embers were the embodiment of magical flame, light, and life, but as word spread about the sheer power of the Embers, they came to be hunted and captured‚Ä¶and so the War for Ember began‚Ä¶‚Äù  From the tome ‚ÄúRestoration of the Lightbringer‚Äù  Gameplay overview A passion project 10 years in the making, Ember is a homage to classic role-playing games. Ember features a deep branching story, endless exploration across dynamic and living environments, a robust skill tree, and an intricate crafting system. In Ember, players are resurrected as a ‚ÄúLightbringer‚Äù and summoned to protect the dying Embers as the world is on the brink of collapse. Beginning in the Deep Barrows, players traverse vast environments divided between aboveground and underground realms ‚Äì ranging from lush forests to dry deserts and dark abysses ‚Äì to reach the City of Light. The story unfolds through encounters with strangers, and players are forced to decide their destiny by making pivotal decisions.  Key features 	Classic-style, role-playing game with 30+ hours of epic adventure  	Epic storytelling filled with fascinating characters, lore, adventure, and humor  	Over 70 quests with diverse gameplay enabling players to choose their path  	Engaging party-based real-time combat system with tactical pause  	Over 65 combat skills for the player to use in customized battle party strategy  	Encounter hundreds of NPCs with their own tales to tell  	In-depth crafting system, from baking bread to forging magic weapons  	More than 20 handcrafted environments and shadowy dungeons  	Meet different companions with their own backstory quests  	Experience dynamic weather and time of day system",https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple111/v4/0e/39/6b/0e396b2d-426b-759c-7074-5b35590ef81f/mzl.worrbikw.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.1 ‚Ä¢ 180 Ratings,$9.99,#151 in Role Playing,"December 20, 2016","To start I must give kudos to developers who poured their hearts into this passion project. As a gamer I can immerse myself into their world and feel the meticulous details. Great character design, landscape, music, voice recording, and effects. Thank you for a wonderful game. Now comes the ""BUT"", and this bit of irate is magnified by the perfection in every other aspect so far I have experienced. The blemish lies in the dialogues and literature of the world. If only the developers hired writers with higher proficiencies the game would be complete. The writing style is of a modern teenager's attempt being a bard or historian which breaks the immersion. And the protagonist sounds less like a legendary warrior and more of a pleading child. I only point it out because this would otherwise have been a standard bearer for iOS isometric RPGs. Hope to see more from developers in the future, and a writing quality on par with Baldur's Gate. The good: Nice graphics with bright colors and buildings that pop out at you. Basic crafting system, not overly complicated. Plenty of quests. Open world.The bad: Would be much better on an iPad, the buttons are so tiny that they‚Äôre hard to hit. Combat feels over simple without many strategic elements. Text trees almost all seem to lead to the same result, regardless of what‚Äôs said. Overt political bias of developers in storyline. Minimal differences in three character classes. The status and menu bars block the screen enough to significantly detract from the pretty graphics. The characters look small as little ants, if you zoom in, it remains fixed on your main character so it‚Äôs tough to zoom in and just focus on things unless he‚Äôs near them. The main character seems empty, hollow, unrelatable, boring, even in his picture. I did win the game, but never felt a huge amount of satisfaction. It would have been better with a little bit more freedom to change the outcome of quests, more text trees with varying outcomes, more strategy in combat, more variety of the classes, and an interface that better suited iPhones without teeny buttons. Just to name a few things. Probably an option for less experienced RPG fans who are looking for a simpler experience and have an iPad. This game is great and worth the price. My only complaint is, as playing as an iPhone player, the controls can be frustrating. My complaints are only with movement. I click on an enemy to attack but the character will move next to the enemy and not attack. Or I will want to move and click on an object instead. Other than that this game is quite addicting and well worth playing if you like challenging rpg's. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

All the characters are fun and cool in their own way. The designs are amazing with something for everyone included. It is not a P2W game unless you want to reach the highest echelons of the PVP or event rewards circles but even if you are a F2P or relatively cheap to player like me you can still be competitive because they give out higher rarity units frequently. The only time you may run into the pay wall is if you want to max uncap a limited unit by getting 5 or 6 copies but it is not necessarily a requirement. The gacha currency is easy to earn week to week through challenges and pvp so you can save up to roll on collab banners or limited ones. The monthly packs give a decent amount too and there are frequently sales going on. The only complaint I had is that the gameplay sometimes gets a little boring once you reach past a certain point, but they‚Äôve added in many different ways to play that it will take a long time before you reach it. If you want to play hardcore you can. If you want to play casually as a waifu collector you can do that too. All in all one of the best games I‚Äôve played so far. Definitely a gacha that i‚Äôve been enjoying for a while. Other than the loads of fanservice, the game is an auto-battle lover‚Äôs dream. The gameplay itself is based around auto-battle, but the fun aspect is being able to make a team that synergises well enough to auto through the content you need it to. There are definitely boosts for whales, but you can definitely get by without spending a dime. The only trouble you might have is PvP, but even the lower ranks give a decent amount of currency per week for you to roll with. The rates are okay (3% for highest rarity, 6% on a daily 10 pull, mileage after a certain amount of pulls, etc) but i‚Äôve definitely seen and dealt with worse. Even though the highest you can pull is 5*, even those unlucky enough to only have 4* and certain 3* units can still get through most of the content. Give it a week of hard grinding, or maybe a month of super casual grinding, and you‚Äôll be pretty ready for events and other stuff. My only concern might be that if you do decide to whale, the shop prices are super expensive for anything meaningful. For f2p players like myself though it isn‚Äôt that big of a deal.If you‚Äôre into lewd waifu teams, this is the game for you! The animation is amazing and the story is unique and fun. You really get to know characters which is great. Storyline ties into events which is extra awesome. Game play is customizable to what you need (full auto and 3x speed, partial auto and 2x speed, no auto and regular speed) which really helps when getting to know your team and how to use abilities, or to save time on grinding once u got a decent setup. I loved this game when I first got it, uninstalled it for some reason, then came back to it recently and am really enjoying it again. The best part is that there's no pressure to pay to play, you can buy lots of things to help you if you want, but it's not necessary to engage with the game in a fulfilling way (especially if you're willing to work hard and grind). I think that fact alone will keep this game on my phone, as I'm trying to only have games where I'm not constantly tempted to spend $$$. It also makes the developers seem like more decent people who actually care about player experience, so if there is an event or something I really want to buy, I'll feel better about giving them my money.

Good game with innovations to make it standout from other farming games.  Not sure how to get the higher level resources like marble...I‚Äôve upgraded the miraculous plot to level 4...seems I should get marble some but can‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm sure the game will further improve with time.  Nice job. Been playing this for a couple days and have enjoyed it...to the extent I could play it. It‚Äôs a fun sim farm game, with enough extra to keep it interesting. The biggest con is the lag time while playing. I‚Äôll try to start producing a product and it will sometimes take 30 seconds or more for it to register in the game. Same with fishing, talking to villagers, and planting and sowing crops. This has happened with incredible regularity over the last couple of days, so while I do enjoy it, I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll have the patience to continue playing for much longer. Not sure what the first few negative reviews are about, this game is as good as any other farming sim out there.  Graphics are nice, easy game play, at first glance it seems there may be some extra depth to this (upgrading tiles, rare products, cows working out, etc.) - I‚Äôve only played a short bit so far so haven‚Äôt fully explored all the features.

It does all the things you need for a game. If you're the kind of person who has a regular table and like stats, download it today. Things I wish it had:There is a ""back"" or ""undo"" button for damage, but there is no way to back up the turn counter.I wish someday that there was a way to save the stats online so that one login could be used for one table or a league or players that play with each other regularly: everyone in the ""league"" would have the app on their device, but we would share a login or there would be a way to create a league and keep communal stats.I wish there was a way to set the poison counter number and that it would register as a kill.I'd like to change the name of a deck without erasing it's previous data.Sometimes the six player screen has trouble drawing lines to the correct player. The drawing lines is an annoying way to register damage from one player to the next.

Alright now let me address something else. People DO NOT download this game if your expecting an open world adventure game. Mobile games can and will not become that in a very long time. This game is a Gacha game. What is a gacha game? Well it a game where you collect ‚Äúunits,‚Äù you then use these units to further progress in the game in various activities. You can upgrade them in a variety of ways. So in that case, this game is nearly perfect. Already far superior than any other gacha game on mobile. You have a 10x auto feature so you don‚Äôt have to keep clicking retry on your phone every minute, you have a new shard system which is amazing for FTP players. And yes this game is COMPLETELY FTP, Tectone(a youtuber) is a top player and has spent no money so trust me when I say that. Although is it nice to support the developers for what a great job they are doing, yes. And now for my Final Point, the developers, they are the best I‚Äôve seen in any game. They respect community feedback and they are very open to changes. For example, energy that you use to progress in the game was massively reduced in the last update by 50% and now it‚Äôs easier to grind more than ever. They had plenty of other great changes too. Thank you devs if your reading this for providing a great game that keeps getting greater with massive updates, most respected devs on mobile! [Com2uS] Dear Portal Master!We're glad to hear that you enjoy the game & thank you for all your support! We hope that you can continue to enjoy the game and we wish you the best of luck in your gameplay! Please be sure to keep an eye out for new events and updates at www.withhive.com and the Event banner within the game. Thank you! Adding a skip feature to the game after completing missions would be extremely helpful, so that players can go back to the same mission and simply press skip, doing this they don‚Äôt have to constantly go through the whole battle over and over again to get what they need in order to level up and upgrade their Skylanders. If you add the skip feature it will allow players that have already completed a previous stage, to go back and loot the stage without going through the whole battle sequence again. If this feature is added in the game, it will help players strengthen their Skylanders more efficiently allowing them to progress further in the game. The game is fun, but not having this feature in the game itself is just........(sigh) boring. I get bored of having to go through the same battles over and over again. I‚Äôll be changing my ratings for the game from 5 stars to 4. Please add this feature to the game, it would be incredibly helpful. Thank You. [Com2uS] Hello Portal Master!Thank you very much for your review! We always appreciate getting feedback from users as it helps us improve the game. We also suggest that you voice your opinion on our forum at forum.com2us.com as comments are regularly relayed over to our devs. Thank you! I‚Äôve never really liked these type of character-based auto RPG gacha games (looking at you, Marvel) mostly because they don‚Äôt let you play as who you want. I was hoping Skylanders would be different, but it wasn‚Äôt. So here is my suggestion to the devs: let the player choose at least one Skylander at the start of the game. The starting three you get (Hot Dog, Stealth Elf, and Blades) are awesome characters, but it‚Äôs discouraging to know that it will take me hours before I can unlock a Skylander I love like Spyro, Drobot, or Dino-Rang.Also, another suggestion, start including older characters more. I‚Äôve noticed the character selection seems heavily based around the later games, which is fine, but older Skylanders like Sunburn, Camo, Zap, Eye-Brawl, and Stump Smash are sorely missing. I honestly expected this game to at least have the original 32 Skylanders, but I guess not.Other than that, it‚Äôs a typical gacha RPG game; you‚Äôll either like it or you won‚Äôt. The UI is at times confusing and the amount of stuff required to do basic tasks like summon or level up Skylanders is frustrating, but that‚Äôs pretty typical for these games. I will give the developers this though: they have really captured the fun tone of Skylanders, and the character designs are spot on. All in all it‚Äôs a decent game, but it lacks a wide range of heroes and is a little grindy. "

But as the title suggests, the odds are NEVER in your favor. The leveling system is ridiculous, with the Kaiju always being way too overpowered. Allow me to explain. The Kaiju‚Äôs abilities charge WAY too fast for the amount of matches they make. Their combo chains are also rigged to give whatever Kaiju you‚Äôre facing 6 to 7+ combos, almost always resulting in your jaeger instantly dying. I also think the team matches against the Kaiju are ridiculous, an example being that the Kaiju stock up enough matches for both of their characters that, when they‚Äôve done enough damage to you, ALWAYS use every ability they have, THEN switch to their partners basically giving them free moves against you. Now, onto the loot system. At the rate players earn Platinum, it‚Äôll be MONTHS before they have enough for even ONE loot box. The game is kinda forcing you to pay for platinum, and as you progress through the game it starts to feel more and more like a ‚Äúpay to play‚Äù type of game. And the glitches in the depot? Just crap. It‚Äôs nice that when I go to open 2 loot boxes I just spent a good chunk of time working for I get no icons, only the quantity of how much I got. And even when I close out of the app and start it again, it doesn‚Äôt show me what I got in my loot boxes, if I even got anything at all. Again, the game has so much potential, but too much demand. Hello! Thanks for your review. We're sorry to hear that you are dissatisfied with our game. We've updated our game (ver 1.6) since you made this review and have included balance changes which allows new ways to turn the tables on the Kaiju onslaught.If you need any tips feel free to contact us directly from the in game Settings>Help menu or Helpshift https://kffgames.helpshift.com/a/pacific-rim/ if you have any questions concerning the new features. This game looks great and is fun to play when just starting out. Granted, when you first get into the game the navigation is difficult at best when you try to get through the menus. This needs to be simplified with a lower number of clicks to get where you are going. Gameplay is smooth and the graphics are cool, I will seem that as a positive for this game. However, the gameplay is still heavily favored to the Kaiju. One previous review of the game by another player brought this item up as well. In my recent gameplay today, the Kaiju had almost unlimited play of their boosts and matches and continued this when switching between Kaijus as well (up to 3 Kaijus in one match). Their matches power up all of the Kaijus on the roster, however the same is not true for the Jaegers. The matches also accumulate quicker for the Kaijus. Gameplay is definitely and severely slanted towards the Kaijus favor, however you may not notice this until you are at level 20 or higher. This is where another roadblock comes in. Leveling up your Jaeger becomes extremely difficult and expensive at this level. Unless you spend a lot of money, plan on being stagnant for a long time. It‚Äôs a good game to get started on but, it is not really good for the long haul or an extended play game. The gameplay needs to be a level platform between Jaegers and Kaijus, at this point it is not. I think the developers can do better. Hello! Thanks for your review. We're sorry to hear that you are dissatisfied with our game. We're working diligently on providing balanced gameplay based on feedback we receive from our players. If you have any suggestions on how we could improve it for you, reach out via Helpshift https://kffgames.helpshift.com/a/pacific-rim/ Honestly I really wouldn‚Äôt advise playing unless you want to spend all your money and barely get enough to get through the first few stages. I mean the kaiju are super overpowered and no matter what move you make they will usually either get a wild and almost kill you or get a bunch of three in a rows and fill their super attacks and insta kill you. It‚Äôs so unfair because it takes so much time to get factory vouchers and when you get enough you don‚Äôt even get a jaeger you want. It will most likely give you some 1 star jaegers shards that won‚Äôt be used. I despise this game and the jaegerworks vouchers are unaccesible because you never release or give any. I have played this game since release and I still despise it. Do better on your game people I mean seriously. I really hate how I have spent so much money and barely have any jeagers. I have spent over 250$ on this game and the only exclusive jeagers I have are Cherno alpha, bracer Phoenix, quake meridian, and midnight winter. I mean considering that my friend payed around 125$ and has gipsy avenger, saber Athena, and brute Komodo is kinda bs. The whole luck that u get in this game is so bad because I have been playing for around 5 months and have around 11 jeagers Hello!

It contains a variety of different fire rescue scenarios that you need to balance realistically with personal life demands putting you in the shoes of a volunteer. The scenes are very well written and varied and your choices really can change the outcome dramatically.  Each play through took me a few hours and it is definitely worth repeated plays to try to get the best rescue outcomes. I'd definitely recommend giving this a try. It is well worth the 2 dollars.Thanks for fixing the donut fire bug so quickly! I don't know exactly why, but I cannot for the life of me take this game seriously... Perhaps the subject matter is too familiar for me to role play with, perhaps the writing style does something weird that makes immersion hard, I dunno. For me at least, this game is in some sort of uncanny valley.If this doesn't affect you like it did me, I hear the game is great but short and has a refreshing level of realism. "

I dont really like how the gameplay of pvp as of now, I feel like the fights in general are too long and it takes basically 3 v 1 to get the hp down at a consistent rate and that still takes about 2 minutes. The pve gameplay is quick and great I can‚Äôt wait for new updates.The experience cap is the only thing that can say I truly dislike Little would you know it doesn‚Äôt take but maximum 2 hours to get to it and it discourages new players to even consider playing often knowing you can‚Äôt do anything in game once you reach it. ***update since comment below - changed rating to 5.  The developers answered and fixed the issue. Looks like my character was moved to another server less full.  They were not deleted. I appreciate resolving the issue.  Thank you I appreciate it!I love the game. I would give it 5 stars, however all my characters are all missing all of a sudden on US server S5.  I hope I get them back or I'll have to delete the game. I exhausted too much time to start over.  I have emailed the developers using the email address they have provided others in the reviews.  I have also included my account they requested.  No response from the developers.  Please respond to the users instead of using a copy/paste response.I would love to see outfits and weapons change as you get gear, like in WOW and O&C.  Having the same thing all the time is boring.  And new gear isn't rewarding, because in a game like this visuals go a long way. The game is great until you reach level 90. Before 90 you can manually change your pvp status from all, guild, team, faction, peace, etc. you can CHOOSE to opt out if pvp. Once you reach level 90 that option goes away and even when set to peace mode other players that are not set to peace mode can attack and kill you. This combined with the small maps and the fact you‚Äôre limited on the amount of experience and gear you can attain per day means you will NEVER be able to catch up, let alone play on a level field with those players that pay real money to further their in game account. These pay to win players take delight in continually killing weaker players while the weaker players are questing. If you do not pay loads of real money for in game items, you will never stand a chance in this game and your weeks/months of grinding will still see you getting continually crushed by the pay to win players. Horrible system greatly entices you to spend money to catch up to the other spenders. A simple change of not forcing you into pvp at level 90 would greatly increase the quality of game play. "

All the bosses have one-hits, high stun chances, or reflect full damage back?!!?!! Like what the point in DEF it does seem to do much and it doesn't help that the lowest stats you get in the beginning. LUK does double damage but it caps at 60 but it doesn't seem to do much. My problem is the lag of weapon choices at certain point (FLAME SWORD all day) and DEF just doesn't seem to protect as much. LvL up isn't that rewarding less these ( +1 AllStats, +Match2, +Match3, +MaxHp) and these are in order of best to least. Individual Stats are ( +DEF, +ATK). LUK doesn't even matter but to easily assessable  so lvling that is waste of time.  At this point investing in high hp stack would be great to help avoid against being 1-shot. This game can be addicting if you enjoy games based on the luck of the draw. But what makes it even more addicting is the customizations you come across like various weapons and enchanted items that can give you an advantage.You can also go to the bar and spend your hard earned gold for the chance toincrease your total hp and luck which is invaluable in the later and harder levels you'll unlock.Yes, its simple and mindless, but its extremely entertaining if you're in the mood for a casual dungeon romp. This has been an all time favorite of mine for years. Tl:dr few good hours of gameplay, pleasant to look at, not too hard to avoid dying but if you die you start over, simple gameplay doesn‚Äôt take away from experience. Would recommend.This game is enjoyable to play although the gameplay is simple and only involves letting a slot wheel spin the lack of ads and retro design style make it better than almost all other games I‚Äôve tried. According to other people it seems once you progress far the difficulty curve becomes too steep I‚Äôve played for about three hours and haven‚Äôt found any issues yet. My only problem is that if you die once you restart but I didn‚Äôt find that to be a huge issue. "

The rewards are awesome but I found out that I cant get any of the rewards unless I‚Äôm actually in the same level of when I can get the reward, also I hate the fact that I can‚Äôt get a specific summon, I also cant get the summon anywhere. I didn‚Äôt even know how to play at first so it was all coming to me too fast as well. So whatever you guys do don‚Äôt use everything you receive all at once. üòû I kept dying a lot...overall its a great game to interact world chat etc. You can roam around freely in the game and see other players and fight them in the arena. To me it was hard to get every piece of information of how to actually play the game, you know specific small details such as the beginner questüòÖüòÇ ps. Letter which btw I did not read or even see cuz you know while your playing the game you don‚Äôt necessarily check everything especially because they have so much written content on almost everything. I recommend this game for players who like online gaming for mobile. I absolutely love the game and the story I love a game with a good story I love everything about the game but two thing the level requirement to  continue the story and how hard it is to level up. Its just so hard to level up its impossible to even level up just once I don‚Äôt even level up once when doing daily tasks and I do all the tasks with EXP given. Daily tasks are supposed to help level you up to meet that level requirement to continue the main story and it just doesn‚Äôt work I really don‚Äôt think the level requirement is necessary because what‚Äôs the point of it when players and not just me but many others can‚Äôt get to that level requirement. If this issue keeps going on people are gonna get uninterested in the game and aggravated with the hassle with leveling up and this level requirement to continue to he story and uninstall the app and stop playing all together. I have a idea maybe to improve the leveling up issue maybe you can Boost the EXP given in the daily tasks because the EXP in the daily tasks is no where close to the EXP Given when you are doing the main story quests it‚Äôs a real big difference between the two and if you can‚Äôt do that then I think you should remove this level requirement thing to continue the story I hope you guys really think about the problem cause I and surely many of other people really love the game and don‚Äôt want it to fail. Thank you for your feedback! We will take your suggestion and will ensure to implement more feature that engage coordination with other players as well as more more events that will help player increase their EXP gaining.Hope you enjoy the game and leave us a better rating.

This story has so much promise and so many pieces left unfinished. With the ultimate climax yet reached, it‚Äôs a shame that this intriguing story is still unfinished. Choice of Vampire is in my opinion a wonderful thought that isn't executed effectively. The problems with this story is that it's too linear. Another annoying feature is that it forces you to partake in its confusing politics which introduces too many characters in such a short time. Lastly, a few people will be confused if they have similar play troughs, but I've found hat certain stats somewhat matter and will bring about an event you didn't chose. However, these actions feel weird and out of place. If you want to continue the first book, I say purchase it, but don't expect it to be too good. Both of the games were great, but I am to this day hoping you guys will make a third one, fourth one, and maybe even a fifth and sixth one? The game is very interesting to me and it would be a great experience to see how you guys would write a story as the timeline progressed and with it our characters strength and status. There are a lot of ""it would be's"" but really I hope you guys make at least a third game. Cheers! "

The items you collect only come out 1 unit at a time where as a random 4,4 or greater minion can come out of no where.  So I feel as your hero progresses in level, the number of units of swords, shields, axes, or picks in one square should increase as well. I also feel like it would be nice to start at the town you are completing quests for, rather than it being an imaginary place.  That way you can track where you are on the board and you could track quest items/monsters as well.  I like the concept of the game and the gameplay itself.  I feel it was worth the $0.99 I paid but definitely could use some more elements. "

You can get pretty bored with it after a while, but when you first get it, it‚Äôs really cool. Sad thing is the problem with the game and the other miga games is that you have to pay for certain rooms and people. It‚Äôs not very expensive but if you got this and saw you would be quite frustrated that a fun game very close to to a life has to be bought. Toca is even free but not some parts in miga. In some of the miga games all you can go in is an apartment and do you really think ü§î that out parents will buy a game like this. For most people. It‚Äôs really fun and you would enjoy it. Just beware of the in game payments. The first place it‚Äôs OK. And I kind a got bored of it easily so I decided to go to the next place but everything looked dark and I couldn‚Äôt move anything and all I saw really was a dark room and A little cat standing in front of a locked door which I guess is kind of cute so I tapped on the cute cat but he wanted me to pay money so I went to another place but the same thing happened and I want to another placeAnd again the same thing happened then I found out everything but that little boring house cost money I just didn‚Äôt get it you‚ÄôreAlso trying to copy TocaIt kind of is like Toca except it‚Äôs more lame and not fun there is no crumpets I don‚Äôt mean cakes if you ever play Toca there‚Äôs these little animals call crumpets but there‚Äôs not even a alive thing except for the people or the pets and there‚Äôs no big fluffy crazy monsters like in Toca and there‚Äôs not one single sloth that is what you call lame and disappointing I know I keep saying lame but that‚Äôs really what it is you‚Äôll think this app is for free but really a little secret comes with  it at least you get one place... that‚Äôs not even fun wellWish you did a better job I don‚Äôt even know if you tried hard you just want money it‚Äôs not what apps are about I love all of the games that you make for everyone I have all of your games but I have a great idea üí° for your game not just this one but I was thinking what if you made a new game that is not just one game but it is all the games that you have made on one app and the games that the people have is made into one game and it is called miga world how I got the idea is that toca boca has a game called toca boca life word and since everybody says that all of your games have only one room so you can get a lot of more room to play in thank you so much for the fun games that you have so far and keep going with your great games your Asome "

I like that it is hip-hop first ballet and not just ballet first ballet or hip-hop first hip-hop. It is a lot of fun to play. Here is another reason that I really like this game and I just started it and I think it‚Äôs really really really good. I think you‚Äôll like this game also because you may like to dance like I do and I love to dance. Maybe you‚Äôre not allowed to go to a dance school but this game is kind of like a dance school. But mostly I think you‚Äôll really like it. It is a lot of fun. Also maybe you were just like it because you like to dance or it‚Äôs fun or you just like to play. I love this game so much and I think you will too so please play it or buy it it‚Äôs a lot of funAnd then you can finally see how much fun it is like I did. I give this five thumbs up because it‚Äôs on me it‚Äôs an amazing game for kids and kids that love to dance like me so I think you‚Äôll love it just like I do. Love Paige Okay I‚Äôm typing for my younger sister she honestly loves  but so hates this game. Have to buy the full version but most kids don‚Äôt have money or enough money or the parents will allow them to buy the full version and it‚Äôs just you know ruins their fun. My Sister just hate how you have to buy the full version but like you don‚Äôt have permission to order also the ads and let‚Äôs say you want the ads to go to way but even if you buy the full version they‚Äôre not gonna go away my sisters has been playing this game now for a couple years now. Also walking like half of the dance moves and hairstyles and outfits is actually not exactly fair because even if you still have the full version you‚Äôre still  you‚Äôre still going to have ads and it‚Äôs going to ruin your fun time. Also it isn‚Äôt fair that some of the different like salons or something like that or being locked off but you still have outfits and you‚Äôre not walking that which is isn‚Äôt fair at all so I would really appreciate if the creator of this game would add something to make the game better. I would also appreciate it if there wasn‚Äôt such a thing called full version because it just ruins the game it ruins your free time fun time you know what I mean, Just removing the ad and removing the locks off of clothing would be nice. Hello there! If you are looking at this review to see if this game is worth getting, I think it‚Äôs awesome! It is VERY addictive (to me at least) and has no flaws in my opinion. First of all, the dance type. When I got this game, I thought that I could only stick to one type of dance. Actually, you can switch the dances(hip hop or ballet). I switched my dances, and I liked it! Also, you can watch ads for SOME items instead of having them locked, which, in my opinion, is great. Though I said there are no flaws, maybe the game should have a little something added. Say it is Halloween and somebody is playing. There should be an update for each holiday. Maybe the game changes by adding some Halloween related things to the game. Maybe the stage has hearts for Valentines Day or snow and presents for Christmas. This is an idea I had that would make this game even MORE awesome! Overall, this game is one of the best games I have ever played! üòÅüëçüèª "

I think the developers had as much fun coming up with all the cat puns as they did the exciting and engaging story. The side quests were all spunky and enjoyable, the world was very well laid out with increasing difficulty as you headed north, causing you to pause and enjoy getting stronger in each location before rushing headlong into the next area. I loved the diversity of equipment and powers and really found a simple pleasure in the attack/retreat pattern of fighting enemies. I loved all the secrets and mysteries hidden throughout the land and once (no spoilers here) a certain ability was unlocked, I couldn‚Äôt wait to search the whole world to its fullest. Great job guys, I enjoyed the game very much!P.S. I‚Äôm so sad to see you added Cat Quest 2 to the Apple Arcade roster which means I will never get to enjoy it due to my refusal to sign up for a membership to play games occasionally on my phone. I don‚Äôt believe in subscriptions and I think it‚Äôs a terrible idea. I would love to pay a flat price and enjoy your sequel, but as it stands I guess number one will have to live forever in my memory as the pleasant and only Cat Quest to me. Cat Quest is very fun and addicting - just a couple changes I would like.When you go into the area to see your weapons, armor and spells you tap on the icon in the bottom left. Then to exit you click on an icon in the upper left. I would love for the exit icon to ‚Äîalways‚Äî be in the same place as the icon to get into anything.I would like more control of how far I zoom out. And I would like to be able to tap somewhere and have kitty cat start walking to that place with the zoom zooming back in on where the cat is. Also on zooming. I would love to be able to tap with two fingers anytime I‚Äôm zoomed out and have it zoom back in for me instead of tapping on an icon. You can add it as part of the training at one of the monuments. Either tap on the icon or double-tab anywhere to unzoom. Or even double-tap to zoom out and then double-tap to zoom back in.Oh, and I would love to be able to put my own X somewhere. I could then tap on that X later with a note about that place. Like that place where you walk through the water to the chest that is off screen? Not everyone will remember where that is after you finally find the key. I‚Äôve spent a few hours playing the game and been all over and haven‚Äôt found the key yet.I would also like to be able tap on the stats for each item so that it can tell me exactly what it refers to. Like 6/6 = six of what and six of what? The game cant really stand on its own ... its not engaging enough to hold your full attention - its more of a mindless game you would play while watching a movie or on a long car ride. Customization is key for a good RPG game and this game offers very little. You get stronger gear from chests & quests, basically you'll get 3 sets - tank, mage or DPS. There is no kind of enhancement or crafting system. Skills are boring too - you pay gold to increase their damage aaaand that's it. I'd say this game would be good for ages 13 and under ... older and you probably wont be too impressed. Due to its simplicity, i believe a 5 year old could easily beat this game. I would say i got my 5 bucks worth as far as the amount of time ive sunk into the game. The 3-star rating is because it's not a great match for me personally, but I would recommend it for casual players and a younger audience. It is a well polished game, my experience has been bug-free and never had even a single crash. There is a foundation here for a 5-star game - as it is, it is generic, lacking in features and any kind of originality to make it a memorable experience. Hoping the developers will give this game a bit more love. "

It doesn‚Äôt hold your hand but it doesn‚Äôt leave you high and dry in jargon or theory.What I found the most important and for me powerful element is that the story, centered around one relatively inconsequential question creates the entire plot, an entire discourse on ethics, morality, power and even life and asks some powerful question in the story and then answers them. Or better yet let‚Äôs you answer it yourself. It is truly hard to describe the elation I had at this story and just how much it moves me without spoiling it so I will wrap up here with this. I laughed and cried with the characters. I walked and ran with them and I danced and wondered with them. I was there and that is not something I can say about a lot of stories. Oh this is such a fun game! And I loved every character they were all sweet and 3 dimensional. They really do make you want to save everyone, especially Loren, such a sweetheart. The story was great as well, by the end, I felt like I‚Äôd just starred in my own gothic romantic adventure. I got the friendship ending where I saved everyone but didn‚Äôt date and I feel like my heart grew three sizes, it was so heartwarming. If I did have any feedback though, I would love the option to be of another race. Being non-white, it felt a little odd to be compared to Dev and Bastian as if I were white(such as the scene where you have to chose whether to go to town or send Dev, and it says something like ‚Äúthey might not take to well to him bc of his skin‚Äù. I remember bc I thought ‚Äúüò¨ well they‚Äôd hate me then‚Äù lol). Speaking of, I really appreciated the attention put into identities in this game, in race, sexuality, and gender identity (there was even a poly option???). It was put in seamlessly, but it still felt like they weren‚Äôt just cosmetic identities. I loved it. Games should really follow this game‚Äôs example when it comes to diversity. This story was beautiful and I was attached to all of the characters by the end. You can tell how much care and craft went into it. I am so attached to the characters I would even love to play a sequel! I really felt their pain and was so worried when I thought they‚Äôd get hurt. I also enjoyed the diversity and especially Loren being nonbinary and the option to be trans. It felt a little bit unrealistic (it would have been great if there was binding in the story etc but it‚Äôs not necessary) but the story was fantasy so it was not difficult to suspend disbelief. The one complaint I have is that the romance all seemed very hurried. I wasn‚Äôt sure who to choose that quickly and was unsure if denying their advances at first would make them no longer romance-able. It was also frustrating because the choices all seemed to happen at very inconvenient times and so I would put off showing interest in them until a more convenient time but then they‚Äôd no longer be available. Spoilers: I was actually very sad when Dev and Loren got together. I love them both so much and I‚Äôm glad they found each other but I would loved to have been able to romance them both (that may have been an option but it wasn‚Äôt in my ending) or at least be able to choose one of them later in the story. Regardless, I‚Äôm so thankful I was able to get them their happy ending. "

So far lots of fun and actually has somewhat of a choice system in which you decide how the future will be. However there are a few issues I do have. One is the glitch where if you dash at a wall sometimes you will get stuck and the enemies will absolutely obliterate you if you don‚Äôt know the exact why to get out. Another is the weapon balancing, now I understand that the weapons are preference and get stronger over time however the cultless sword is the best starting sword to have as the added range beats any other light weapon in the game, the double edge is pretty good too. But the mace is really bad and needs a buff. I would also love to see like frequent updates so we can grow this world! Great job so far. What I love about this game is it doesn‚Äôt punish you for getting killed, you actually get some buffs and perks. With this said you will most likely die a lot if your not that good at fast mostly up close games like I. It took me like 5 tries to kill Dracula‚Äôs hound, and after killing him the levels only get harder it seems if you get hit once your dead. When I finally got to the Dracula level I didn‚Äôt even make it to him before I died. At that point i was a little annoyed going through the seemingly same decisions and levels all just to die and do it again, a real ground hog day feel. But if you have the time or are bored and just want to mess some enemies up as a vampire go for it. One thing I would like is a OST, I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying for it, specially the final Dracula stage music which sounds sick. In a crowded mobile space, Immortal Rogue really stands out. Rather than just surface-level, mindless clicking, it brings impressive polish, unique mechanics, interesting premise, and a fun, replay-worthy formula to the table. The combat is fun and easy to learn, and the game offers a progressive challenge for those who are up to it. What‚Äôs really nice about Immortal Rogue is that you can pick it up and play for a couple minutes, or stick to it for a few hours. Either way, you‚Äôre getting a satisfying, rewarding experience. The added layers of the time-traveling story, upgradable abilities and weapons, and changing environments really gives it a fresh, addictive quality every time you jump back in. This one‚Äôs a winner and should be played by anyone who loves an original, well-made game‚Äîlooking forward to how many years I can make it on my next run through time. "

It only happens when i am outside of the mall.  I am sorry i cannot provide many details. Please respond and fix this and i can play more This game, alongside School Of Chaos, has become pretty boring. Not to mention, this game is very ‚Äòlowkey‚Äô, meaning that not many people really know about this game. I have no place to give buildings advice, but I think that it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to be given some sort of promotion, or advertisement of some sort. Unless I had found Bad Nerd through hours of sitting through games on the App Store, I don‚Äôt think I would have ever found School of Chaos, and eventually City of Chaos. And, let‚Äôs be honest, there‚Äôs no incentive to make any game better at least to a prestigious level unless that said game was doing pretty well in the first place. To exemplify how not well the game is doing, people used to use the game to make their own personal gain (money), if a person had the capability they could hack the game with ease, and the game sells exclusive items for upwards of $50. I think that if this game had gotten more attention than it does now, you developers can probably have a better motive to improve the game, and you might have a better name and exposure in the market so that you may even get better help developing and improving the game. I could be wrong on so many accounts, but that‚Äôs just my opinion from peer to peer. Nonetheless, this game is great, and despite myself leaving or quitting this game numerous times, I still never fail to come back to it. I hope you read this, and thank you ;) For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know. Months back Vnl got sued and old Vnl went bankrupt. Old Vnl knew what they were doing. For a while now there has been a few developers. I tried to reach out and give ideas but you ignored my emails multiple times. Back on topic though. I remember school of chaos was ahead of its time. I‚Äôm not sure why you guys didn‚Äôt add on to soc because it was very addicting. I feel like city of chaos is more clunky especially in combat. Movement is slippery and there isn‚Äôt much to do. Supposedly I‚Äôm pretty sure you guys have been working on this game for years and you‚Äôre letting school of chaos slip away. At this point you‚Äôre using soc to promote city of chaos. I can tell because the Valentine items are bad. Most of them are just from least year. Sadly I feel like by the time you‚Äôre done with this game soc will be extinct and there will be less players on city of chaos . I‚Äôm the end people will unfortunately forget about you‚Äôre game. It‚Äôs already happening because there really isn‚Äôt a lot of people with city of chaos. Most of them deleted the game because it‚Äôs still unfinished. I really hope you guys know what you‚Äôre doing. "

The cute and fun art style, combined with great music, topped off with solid gameplay that feels really good is a recipe for a great mobile game! Its difficulty is varied enough for both beginners and hardcore players to enjoy, and putting your reflexes and mind to the test feels great! When there is so much poor content that litters the app store (that people pay for too!), seeing a well-made game that isn't littered with ads and an unnecessary surplus of in-game purchases makes me really happy! I feel like the game developers really just wanted to make a fun game first and foremost, and it came from their passion and not because they want to just make loads of cash. I encourage everyone to continue to support this company and Digrun, because quality content like this on mobile games can be difficult to come by these days! I can really see them making some great content in their future. I hope to see more! I encourage anyone looking for a cute and fun game and wants to kill some time to check out Digrun!

‚ÄéEndless Depths 2 RPG,"Endless Depths 2 is a rogue-like role-playing game that holds true to classic features such a randomly generated dungeon levels, a myriad of class/race combinations, a bunch of treasure to discover and a one-life-one-death difficulty level that can be quite addicting. In addition to what might be expected in a rogue-like RPG, Endless Depths 2 adds a level of persistence to the genre that allows for item farming, crafting, and even increased difficulty levels should a character make it to the end. Endless Depths 2 is a sequel to the popular Endless Depths and Endless Nights RPGs available in the app store.   It uses the TitanFire RPG system, which focuses on building a strategic defensive combat system.   This class-based game encourages a mixing and matching of classes, including special classes that can be unlocked as the character progresses.   Endless Depths 2 Features: * Classic rogue-like game play and turn-based strategy * Farm gold and gems that carry over from one character to the next * Craft items from the gold you've acquired (even gold gained from previous characters) * Start with 4 basic classes (Warrior, Adventurer, Cleric, Mage) and discover over 20 new classes as you progress * Start as 6 basic races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Gnome, Halfling, Half-Ogre) each with their own unique ability * The game starts over with increased difficulty should you defeat Mephistopheles Endless Depths 2 is similar to RPG classics like Rogue,  Angband and Diablo with a level of challenge similar to Dark Souls.  You can find online help for the game at http://www.nations-software.info/endless-depths-help or by clicking ""Online Help"" from within the game.  ***All new to the Endless series*** See the nuts and bolts as the status will display your dice roll and any bonuses compared to your enemy's dice roll and bonuses.

Handles great but looks like my childhood games. One of the worst things about randomly generated environments is that they often look totally fake and out of place.  Endless Depths 2 does great placing pseudorandom elements like hallway statues and fountains and altars to make dungeons memorable.  Great ""as you fight, so shall you level"" character development too.  Try a true retro RPG.  Take it from someone who was there! This is an incredible game, don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs fun and addictive and well crafted. But recently I‚Äôve run into creatures with 75% poison and magic resistance, weakness to light, and 100% resistance to literally everything else, including physical attacks. This is one case where I believe the game to be unbalanced, because playing a melee character means almost certain death when faced with one of these, especially since almost all monsters follow you RIGHT up your bum with almost no way to get away from them. We don‚Äôt need incredibly fast monsters that are 100% invincible unless you have very specific abilities. Instant fan. This is super addictive and well thought out. Only criticism is the lack of music or even some environmental ambience would be nice. Other than that this is down right solid and a lot of fun to play! "

I wish we had the original Wiz for iPhone...The price is very reasonable, I appreciate the developer's efforts (I read the credits, Jon!) and am going to enjoy finishing this little gem. Hi, Catman! Thanks for the review! You're exactly right: That very first Wizardry game for the PC all the way back in the '80s was a big formative influence on me, and it was fun to get to pay homage to it in Vigil RPG. :-) One of my absolute favorites. The graphics are budget, & the adventure is on the short side, but this is one of the most advanced & innovative games around. It's the RPG equivalent of an old school hot rod: strip away all the excess weight, supercharge the engine, then tune & balance it all to  perfection. The ""engine"" in this case is the combat system, and it's a nitro burning beast. I wholeheartedly recommend Vigil to anyone considering it, and I sincerely hope that AggroMagnet brings more games like this to market. Hey Discostallion, thanks for the super kind words! You pretty much nailed exactly what I was going for when I decided to make Vigil RPG: A fun and engaging combat system -- which is, after all, the bulk of what you spend your time doing when you play any RPG -- and just enough decent graphics, sound, and story around all of that to make it work. There's no sequel in the works as of right now, but if I once again get the itch to play a certain type of game that I can't find on the App Store -- as I did when I wanted to play a game like Vigil RPG, couldn't find one, and decided to make it myself! -- your kind words about enjoying Vigil RPG will be a big motivating factor! Thank you! I purchased this app after reading your interview on making a one-man game. Thanks for putting so much awesome info in the credits/acknowledgements. It is definitely challenging but also a lot of fun to play! I'll definitely buy your next game! Hey, MikeTMorpheus! I'm glad you liked reading the interview I did with TouchArcade; it was my first time doing something like that! As a solo developer, I did take advantage of many graphics and music assets that other folks had kindly posted online under Creative Commons and similar licenses, and I definitely wanted to make sure each and every one of those folks got credit for the cool stuff they had created! I really appreciate the review! :-) "

The puzzle really isn‚Äôt that hard and not realistic but is very comical. It‚Äôs like the loony toons but with Henry stick man. But I wish there was a few more parts to it (or at least some more funny options even of they don‚Äôt work). Other than that, this game is amazingly funny and super fun. This game is funny and a little hard but the ad‚Äôs ruin it. it‚Äôs so annoying and I don‚Äôt want to pay to get rid of ad‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a way to pay to get rid of ads. It‚Äôs just annoying they get you annoyed to the point of buying to get ad‚Äôs out of the way! I haven‚Äôt paid to get rid of ad‚Äôs and I won‚Äôt there are many FREE games that don‚Äôt make you pay to get rid of ad‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt have any. Or there like every 30min but this is ever 5 seconds. So if you ok with ad‚Äôs every 5 seconds to 2 mins then this is perfect. If not, this game is really fun you should still try it but beware of AD‚Äôs. This may seem like a funny game but its actually stolen content. Just from looking at the the title screen I that this is just a stolen game. The audio is also all glitched out too. I haven‚Äôt played the Original Escaping the prison but watching people play it, it never did that. Please don‚Äôt play this game. Its just a copy. This guy also didn‚Äôt seem to credit Puffballs United anywhere I looker, although I may just be wrong on that part. I don‚Äôt mean in the game itself. I mean in the app description. Like I said, This guy just copied the entire game and was too lazy to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything like glitches or the game crediting Puffballs. Please don‚Äôt download this app. Its a cashgrab. "

I also like organizing my islands and breeding new dragons. This game is pretty fun, but why I‚Äôm rating four stars is because of two reasons: 1. Everything‚Äôs really pricy. I know you‚Äôre trying to make the game more challenging, but come on guys, just lower the price just a little. I‚Äôm on lvl 14, and i still think clearing obstacles is expensive. It‚Äôs no fun just being stuck without being able to afford anything. 2. I never get my prize after a tournament. It‚Äôs not fair because you‚Äôre working really hard to get a good prize and then when the tournament is over you don‚Äôt get the prize at all. Don‚Äôt get me wrong,I love this gameüëç, but I think it will be better if you made it easier to play. Gota say love the game, somewhat balanced but this game really shines in the combat system. Love the idea of armor and tons of different upgrades for dragon abilities and stats as well. But please make it so save data can be saved on Facebook cuz I don‚Äôt use gamecenter anymore and it‚Äôs a pain when my current gamecenter just resets my island to a empty land. There should be an ability to transfer save data over to a Facebook account (like dragon city) or to another gamecenter account. Or better, make their be a dragon world account system where you can sign in and have your save data saved on a server. (Which would cost a lot I‚Äôm guessing) but I‚Äôm just throwing out ideas to make this more optimizable. Other than that great game :) I used to love this game. But it feels like the developers abandoned it. Features are now obsolete, like any friend adding through Facebook, which is fine. However, they don‚Äôt remove any of the quests pertaining to deleted features. Nor any of the references to adding friends. And whatever you do DO NOT contact customer support. They will just give you no resolutions and then fill your inbox with useless emails asking if they have resolved an issue they told you they cannot or won‚Äôt resolve. When you ask them to stop emailing you over and over, they will continue to do so. It‚Äôs maddening. I finally deleted the ap. Which is a shame because the graphics are the best of one of these types of games but it‚Äôs clear they really don‚Äôt care about making the game make sense - like deleting features and quests relating to features that no longer function.

It's a much better game now, so thank you, Gluten.A few tips to whoever' reason this-- to get to the underwater ship den, you have to go to the bottom level of the ship. There's a hatch you can go down on the two upper levels, or some handy windows at the very bottom of the sunken ship. Then, at the bottom level, there's a wall with two shark-sized doors. Past the wall is the den.To get away from an opponent you don't want to fight, press the red X and swim away. Sometimes the opponents will be very fast, so I'd press the button for Fast Mode so you can get out of there sooner rather than later.To get around the crashing, pick a den close by to where you do most of your stuff. The underwater ship has lots of prey and a nice breeding ground nearby, but one den (can't remember which) has barely any prey. Which can be a challenge when the prey is hard to catch. If you pick a good den, you don't have to lose much traveling for food/a mate whenever it crashes.If your shark becomes a laggy mass of random pixels, don't worry. Just wait a bit, particularly further underwater. It happens more to me when my head's poking out above water. "

Your first impression may be that the game is too easy, or that there's nothing you can do to get farther than your last game. That's not the case! The game rewards the time you spend figuring out its systems and learning how to optimize your progress by making it possible to do better and better. It helps that it's so snappy. Games can take a few hours if you're doing well (but the autosave is perfect for mobile), but compared to other games with interesting min/max systems, there's really very little bloat. I like the idea of fire emblem or xcom where your tactics and upgrade choices make a real difference in outcomes. But in reality they stress me out and lead to save scumming or resignation because it might take ages to realize that I've messed up irreparably. Fun, clear graphics. The music is good. The unlock scheme is interesting. I like that the game isn't a pseudo roguelike where you can eventually grind your way to excellence with a persistent reward. I'd love to read some interviews with the developer, he clearly put a lot of thought into creating a fun, balanced system.Edit 2018: fixed some typos For what it does, this odd game is great: it throws together a slew of symbolic creatures, events and gear, and makes you place an increasingly hostile hand of tiles down to get to an exit.However, the Nemesis is the ugliest, indiest graphic placeholder asset I've seen for an adversary.  At least use a cool shapeshifting monster face that gets increasingly hostile as it levels up, with its level as a small Roman numeral near it.  Nobody past Sesame Street age gives a crap about being chased by the number 3. Well, some slow Electric Company types, but you'll always have those.I may not have unlocked a problem-solving event after a few hours, but there should also be an increasing base percentage of providing a fitting tile each time you get stuck.  Stalling is random to the point of ugly.  Maybe it's a neat risk-to-reward mechanic for bending your path backwards, but it really is a showstopper in a game that is so slow to start with.  If you're an accountant with a big manga collection, knock yourself out, but if you have to reset three times in three seconds like Angry Birds, move on. Please, please, please update Dungeon Raid to 64-bit for iOS 11+!It was my favorite game, but now I can't play it anymore!I am playing this game now, and it's very good too. But I miss the seemless flow of playing Dungeon Raid!! "

This app has simple tips and acquisition locations for every item, organized by category and set. I especially like how the boss weapons are organized in their boss header, and included in the weapon type lists. My only (minor) gripe is the scrolling through the item lists could be more responsive. Not a whole lot to this app. It gives information great to have at your fingertips while playing the game. Item descriptions and some great information upgrading weapons. How the upgrade process works, the math behind each upgrade and the locations of items needed to make the upgrades. Even though there isn't a ton of information in the app what is there is definitely worth the money. Make the purchase. This app to start off, is phenomenal and very ambitious. The display is very ascetic as well as pretty accurate descriptions and contains very helpful information. However it is missing rings, as well as other minor details. Also, Scholar of the first sin, boss stats, merchant locations, and level description. If these things are added overtime, this app would be a 5 star app. Again, full of potential. Thanks for making a great, solid app. "

I love these games but on other reviews written it says thanks for making these free for the first week or something like that. Every single my town game I have besides my town home was $2.99!! I can't afford it! I would delete every other game I have for all of the my town games but I can't get them all because they are too expensive. I know you are trying to make as much money as possible but if so many people like these games they will get more if they are a cheaper price. That way your are making probably even more money. Please make your games like 99 cents and not $2.99. Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. I just wish there were more than 1 jail sell and in the cop car after you fix it you could go arrest criminals like how at the fire station you can put out fires and save peoples lives! In the sell you can go through the sewers well I wish you could escape and it lead somewhere outside the jail.I have a lot of good ideas that I would love to share more sometime. "

The controls are simple but yet effective. The gameplay is good for beginners but you will need practice to be good. (Personally love that game design). The design of the graphically is AMAZING to say the least. It‚Äôs runs very smoothly (around 60-80 FPS witch is unheard of in mobile) the graphics and game art style is AMAZING. The character roster is really really great with characters for every different play style. And I love how that added a competitive mode with all of the characters unlocked and all moves unlocked. But Man I wish mobile would let us the skin of the character you own in competitive, like it would still be competitive but it would let me use my other big band costumes but only the skin not the stats, like an ult in smash bros or other fighting games or like in 2nd encore we‚Äôre they let you use a skin, and I want it because I want to show people cool looking characters and stuff but I don‚Äôt like playing free for all because not only people with characters that have the power level advantage would win 90% of the time, but the good thing is you can show off the cool characters. So if the game devs are reading this please add a feature we‚Äôre we can use the character costumes in competitive. This game is really really worth a download and playing and I‚Äôm only asking for one thing and that is to let us use our character costumes in competitive. Hey there,Thanks for the great review! Expanding the options and features of the online Versus mode is definitely something we want to do eventually. I can't give any specifics yet, but it's definitely on our radar! Best Regards,~HVS~ This game is absolutely great in every way possible. If you know you can handle it. It‚Äôs not for everyone. You need good hand eye coordination, and just being mature enough as you will enjoy the game even more. Getting premium credit is not difficult once you master how the system works a and how to properly use a good number of the 12 different fighters. I currently use Peacock, Squigly, Ms. Fortune and Beowulf really well now. Just playing a good amount that you get comfortable using combos and adapting makes it even more enjoyable. It will get slow after day not gonna lie but once I persevered and continued to keep players by I was rewarded with having lots of fun and getting excited to start getting silver tier and hopefully soon enough a gold tier. If you get stuck, you must remember as I don‚Äôt see too much help online,Don‚Äôt sell anything (yet)Upgrade Bronze even if you know there are silver and gold characters. (They are still good to have)Take risks that fit how well you play. I also love the comments some of these characters make after winning a match. I‚Äôm still laughing after the fact. Getting fully immersed in the story will be amazing for you. There are so many good things to say that you should just stop reading and play already. Thanks for this awesome btw, developers. Music is great, graphics is 200% on point, no glitching EVER and I‚Äôm happy to be playing! ü§©ü§Øü§óü§üüèªüëèüèªüëåüèª I downloaded this game a couple weeks ago and i‚Äôve been grinding a lot, almost every day, and I can‚Äôt seem to get enough of the game. I haven‚Äôt spent a cent but I can still get as far as everyone else by just playing. this game is hilarious, from intro/outro lines, but it even has JOJO REFERENCES. I could leave the review here from that last point alone but I have more praise for this game. I love the gameplay mechanics, they‚Äôre easy to learn and when you can eventually hit like 30 hit combos you feel untouchable. Another good aspect of this game are the constant updates and daily/weekly challenges. they keep the game interesting without necessarily getting repetitive.

I think you've hit an obscure rule in the game that when the portal appears, all teleport spells are lost (to avoid 'cheating'). You could teleport in, kill Veldar, and then teleport out before the portal appears.  This would be the only way to get the keys to the door as well.Teleporting can break the normal flow of some quests which is why it is not an immediately accessible spell. If you have further questions, I'm happy to help if you email support@sonicsloth.com Just picked this up a few days ago after hearing about it in the touch arcade comments... can't believe I didn't know about this game sooner!  I'm a huge fan of turned based strategy games and this game satisfies that itch in a big way.  It's challenging in a way that forces me to improve my decisions in the game. The RPG elements are the icing on the cake. The minecraft-like graphics fit the game well.  The worlds, monsters, atmosphere, challenge and light story all work together to make a fun, addicting game. This game shatters the mold for what an SRPG can be. Your warlock has weapons to craft, spells to cast, & an entire Monstrous Manual of minions to summon and command. These elements are conjured onto battlefields that are incredibly interactive, allowing your tactics to be limited only by your imagination (& resources). Battles play out more like table top RPGs than anything else I've ever seen in digital gaming. Summon an Elf, craft him a longbow, & mount him on a Pegasus to out flank your opponent? Yup, you can do that. That just makes my day :D "

The flight controls are still angering, but other than that it‚Äôs a pretty good game.You go on quests. There are bosses, Mini bosses and wild animals you can take on! Tame animals!Well, sort of.Players should be able to tame any animal they come across rather than the set three (Sabertooth, Wolf, Dragon). I like how the amount of land there is in the game is increasing, and that the graphics are decent. The gameplay time is still at a small, and the same concept of nymphs and books is still there. In your next game, here is what I suggest:I noticed there was a black and white dinosaur model that looks kind of like a spinosaurus (without the spine) and I like it a lot. Maybe you could center it around that one?Maybe it could have that power tree I have talked about in my review of ‚ÄúClan of Dragons‚Äù, and maybe you have to grow your dinosaur (actually growing it) and going on a newer concept. Like:1. You hatch (with a sibling?)2. You learn the basics (hunting, drinking)3. You go out and collect materials for armor and defeat bosses while growing4. Daily quests!Again, these are all ideas, it‚Äôs your game and your models and these are only suggestions üòÅThanks!

Doesn‚Äôt seem too p2w just yet. However, the lack of content is an issue. Theres no real way to farm gold or pandora materials. You have to rely on Hot Time in order to get some gold  which is only for 3 hours on the weekend. The amount of gold ‚Äúfarmed‚Äù in that time is so minimal compared to how much items actually cost. We need some sort of gold dungeon. Also, there needs to be other ways to get materials for pandora. With pandora you need 3 materials to craft a piece of gear. Its totally RNG but supposedly the more materials you put in the higher the chance for good gear goes up. For a game that relies heavily on gear crafting there is absolutely no way to get those crafting materials besides doing daily and weekly achievements. They simply don‚Äôt give enough. The game is fun but could definitely use improvement in certain areas. But above all we need more content! Once you beat chapter 6 there is literally nothing left to do and the dev team has not given any indication of an upcoming update which it desperately needs to keep the player base interested.

Unfortunately this game revolves around having good gear and the only way to do that is to not level up but to ‚Äúenchant‚Äù you‚Äôre gear which involves pulling dupes. The crafting system can be frustrating cause it‚Äôs completely RNG...You can spend all your resources or barely any and it won‚Äôt affect the rarity of the equipment pulled. So if you don‚Äôt pull dupes to help enchant your equipment you then are unable to unlock some of the more unique skills of your equipment which makes the difference in boss battles. Cause the conquest mode where you farm material to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù your equipment is significantly harder than the campaign which is what you play to unlock the conquest boss.So you become under power and unable to advance even. So if the developers want to emphasize equipment they need to re-haul crafting or make it to where you don‚Äôt need to pull dupes to unlock the unique skills needed to take down bosses. I want to believe in this game, but the traction on this game is slipping as more people are getting frustrated and quitting...the download numbers can show. Pretty soon people will start making rant videos as many of the content creators are 1) out of content to make and 2) leaving to play more popular games.

‚ÄéFinding Bigfoot monster hunter,"Bigfoot monster hunter is new FPS horror game. You need to face mysterious monster beast. Be a brave hunter and find Bigfoot in north forest. A lot of people who went on finding Bigfoot just disappeared. Knowing that this adventure might be very dangerous, you prepared for it?  Bigfoot or Sasquatch is a hairy, upright-walking, ape-like being who reportedly dwells in the wilderness and leaves behind large footprints. Over the years, individuals claim to see the creature across North forests.  Your journey starts from a hunted cottage surrounded  in large north forest with lakes, swamps and caves. You need to equip yourself with spy cameras, traps, hunting rifle, flashlight gun and all necessary items for horror survival. You can always come back to collect emergency health box or more bullets.  Horror Sasquatch journey starts as soon as you leave cottage. You need to survive in forest and search for Bigfoot. Days and nights may pass and you will hunt and eat animals but you cannot leave this forest. You need to find big foot and hunt monster down.  Remember, many people have tried to kill the big foot but failed.

I understand you need ads but do you need to let the game keep playing while an ad is playing. Just now I almost killed Bigfoot and a bear saw me, I started killing it when an ad played, all I heard was the bear growling and my character grunting, when I could skip the ad I had 1 hit point left, pure horror, the last thing I saw was a bear on its hind legs, growling, striking then...game...over. Please fix this, like, pause the game while an ad is playing or place the ads differently, please. Thank you for reading my review. This is a really fun game to play, I can see the idea behind it, but there is so much that you guys can do to improve it that it honestly hypes me up. Some ways in which you guys can improve the game are:             ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-: change the way that you land, make the landing more realistic, also have there be dead bodies around the map(it will give the game more anxiety)....Have there be more missions other than just killing bigfoot, maybe having you save someone that bigfoot has captured or something like that...the map needs to have more to it like more structures more places to explore-Now one big thing is co-op online if you guys are able to get online multiplayer into this game it would be HUGE-ex. Let players create a gameroom so that you can play with your friends and 2v1 Bigfoot. That would be very fun......Also the ads that keep poping up when u play are annoying it would be nice to remove those...those are just ways that u guys can improve the game because I believe I can be a very good game, but other than that keep them updates coming guysüí™üëçüëç This game is great! The graphics aren‚Äôt too bad, but it‚Äôs good enough that you can actually play the game. But it is missing some things and stuff that needs to be removed. For instance, i‚Äôm pretty sure no one likes ads popping up every minute or so when your getting attacked by a giant ape in their own home. And bears, they need to get removed. They are too buggy, and frankly they are the only thing you worry about when your out in the forest. You worry about them more than you do worry about Bigfoot. And when I had spawned it I was instantly attacked by them. What it‚Äôs missing: A storyline. There is no reason your hunting Bigfoot, you just jump out of a helicopter WITHOUT a parachute. Which is weird. Why can‚Äôt the helicopter just land instead of jumping out all Fortnite *cough* Fartnight! Style? You just land at a house in a forest. Anyways, the rest of the game is wonderful! "

Because I'm looking and it doesn't say which dragons to breed so I'm really confused i even used the breeding calculator i put in the dragons i wanted to breed and pressed breed it just took me to the top of the screen and showed white so i exited the app and re loaded it and it still did that so I'm really confused The encyclopedic stuff is useful. But in general, the app is very laggy and kind of temperamental. The breeding calculator is not very user-friendly. It is there and it is at least something though.Be careful not to accidentally click any ads during lag spikes (even if you can‚Äôt see them yet, they can still get you)- you may have to restart the app because they‚Äôre so hard to get back from.Ultimately, I don‚Äôt have the patience and will take this off my phone.

Several places they have asked for player feedback and provide a hot key for quick and easy access to their support team. I‚Äôve never seen that in a game where they really seem to want to listen to you and assist you if needed. Many other big name games could learn from this one about how to keep customers happy! So had a lot of fun for the first week. But even at just 2 weeks in gets very monotonous!  Log in do the same exact thing every day.  The only new content you get after lvl 250 (which isn‚Äôt that high) is farther in the Chapter. But that lasts for about 10 mins and then you need 10 more levels to unlock more. That system is absurd!  If you have the power to beat the next Chapter then you should be able to play it. But let‚Äôs get to the real issue VIP level. It is a huge driving force for content. Unlocking content/more loot.  Everything except Chapters is driven by VIP lvl. Want the good gear better raise that VIP level it you‚Äôll never get it. Want to raise your level yup look forward to a weeks worth of logging on and barely having access to do anything. Or raise your VIP level.  I got sucked in spent about $50 on this game and I‚Äôm barely in the top 10 for power and I‚Äôve been playing since the server opened.  My 2nd and 3rd character which I have spent no money on aren‚Äôt even close to be on leaderboards.  And trust me to get anywhere on this game you have to be high power or else you‚Äôll get be down on the most important events.  If you don‚Äôt want to spend money trust me there is much better RPGs out there. The game is fun and enjoyable to play with friends and helping out others. The only thing that makes it annoying is that VIP is a must have to get more chances in dungeons and to go into the VIP dungeon. Without vip you‚Äôll be leveling up and getting gear really slowly. You guys need to have more boss/dungeon chances without needing to have vip all the time. There‚Äôs not much to do after you‚Äôve done everything besides events which are somewhat ok. Only reason for that is because you have these pay to win guilds and players that keep you from getting the good loot in those boss fight events. My server has (which is new and started 2-3 weeks ago) already has the number 1 guild at almost 1 billion power. It‚Äôs half full of people who pay to be #1 and keep in mind that the server is really brand new. The devs really need to balance this game out a lot with them because there‚Äôs no point in doing these events for better gear when they swoop in and keep you from it even though they don‚Äôt need it. At least separate the high lvl players from lower player with events that require a specific lvl to enter and once you already have everything you need from it, it will lock you out and place you into a higher lvl of the same event. Hi there, thanks for your sincere support and suggestions for Dragon Storm Fantasy! We have collected your opinions and will take them into consideration in the future development of the game. Have a nice day! "

I saw the commercial during another game and it has a similar title to a game I knew I would like so I downloaded it. I have hated wall games all the way back to when it was very likely the only electronic game you could own. I‚Äôm talking pre Atari, the true Stone Age of games. I‚Äôm sure I liked it when I first got it but when it‚Äôs the only game in town and then the Atari came out I began to hate it the same way I hated hair metal. I loved it at one time but now it‚Äôs embarrassing. The depth of this game, the affect characters have, the interesting levels all surprised me. I may start looking for other games I‚Äôve excluded as result of this game and hopefully I can conquer my traumatic gaming past. I‚Äôm obviously exaggerating traumatic and considering actual trauma faced everyday I needed to point that out so I didn‚Äôt feel like a dick for putting that in. Great game even if you hate wall bouncers. So I think this game is excellent overall. It‚Äôs a unique take on the normal brick breaker formula and it works very well. My main issue with the game is that you cannot train (level up) your team members beyond the level you are as a player. For example, if you are player level 20, that means you can‚Äôt level up any of your team members past level 20 either. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you literally have enough potions to level up a character to level 30, if you are only player level 20, then you can only level your characters to level 20. Only until you reach player level 30 can you use the potions that you‚Äôve had since you were player level 20 to level up your team members to level 30. This is a really dumb way to make the game more of a grind, not sure if this was intentionally done by the developers to make you want to pay real money to speed up the leveling process, but either way, it‚Äôs dumb. Developers, please fix this system. You already have other things such as energy limits and runes that can only be obtained in later levels to make the game more of a grind and slow progression, so why have the flawed training system too? Please let us train our team members to any level we can with the potions and coins we have, regardless of the level we are as a player. I want to be able to level up my characters when I have the necessary resources (potions and coins) to do so, NOT when I finally reach the next player level. Edit: Well I never lost interest... a few months later... game is still super fun. Once you get into the rhythm of the game and start upgrading heroes it becomes more and more engaging. Plus updates are constantly adding features and responding to player requests. Great game. Original review: First want to say that this game is super fun and puts a cool spin on the hero collecting/upgrading concept. Now for the negative: So I know devs are trying to get people to spend premium currency, but this is ridiculous. I can play for 15-30 minutes (including 1-2 level ups and tower) before I‚Äôm out of energy and have to wait OVER EIGHT HOURS before my energy is completely refilled. That‚Äôs absolutely insane. 3 minutes per energy is ridiculous. It needs to be 45 seconds to a minute or the devs need to severely reduce the energy cost. I‚Äôm only 2.5 days into this game and I‚Äôm already losing interest. "

It‚Äôs why I make games and specifically open worlds. I like exploring nature and using my imagination And I want others to have a place you can do the same. NimiAn Legends feels like it‚Äôs a real place to me in some ways and I am always trying to learn better ways to bring it to life. Right now I‚Äôm working on a new world that‚Äôs a lot larger and I hope to bring you an even more massive natural world to explore soon. Vandgels and BrightRidge are two places that have been in my head since I was a kid and it‚Äôs a lot of fun to finally see these characters in an actual game. Your spirited feedback and five star review also really support me. As you said I‚Äôm one person so I also am boosted when people say kind things and it means a lot to me that the experience meant something positive to you:) I will keep it up! First off let me start off by saying that this game is absolutely one of the most visually stunning games I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on for a mobile game. I will say that the developer has shown great care and love to the scenery the characters in the story and some really great plot twists. I fully support your development of these games and of any future endeavors you might undertake. I will say that I am a person who does not write many reviews about games that I play because I play so many it‚Äôs not worth it for me, however coming across this title I knew that I had to speak up because I could absolutely tell the amount of effort put into this game. I have recently downloaded another title by this developer and look forward to checking it out as well. Thank you very much for putting the effort into this as you have. I am at a loss on the great reviews for this game.  Perhaps it does not work correctly with the newest ipads?  I am using an ipad pro with 256gb of storage, over half of which is free and I had no other programs open.  My experience with this and the prior Nimean game is that the controls are utterly horrible.  Camera swings about wildly when you try and move your character and constantly works in too close.  Changing control and view settings did not help.  Game does not seem to be designed for a touch screen and there is no onscreen joypad appearing even when I select that option.  Simply agonizing to try and make the character do anything.  Also, no audio speech, just a compressed squealy babble when characters talk - text does appear at the bottom of the screen but I tend to miss it - just weird as speech bubbles do appear most of the time when characters talk - however there are no words in the bubbles.  Also difficult to tell who is speaking and who they are speaking to due to camera jumping around and getting too close in.  There may be a great experience here, but I‚Äôll never know it.  Life is too short. There are lots of great games out there that work properly - better to play one of those than struggle with this.  Oh well. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

This  game is good right now because it gets players moving during quarantine. Also I would like to say that the energy And coins gets annoying. If you don‚Äôt have enough you have to buy some and no one wants to keep buying stuff for a game over and over. I read in the other reviews that others were having that issue to. Also In the vault you can delete items. I would like it to ask twice instead of once to delete an item because I accidentally deleted a very useful potion. In the chambers In Hogwarts it doesn‚Äôt let me switch back to AR so can u make that easier please. Since we are in quarantine I would like it if more objects came closer to me because we can‚Äôt leave the house as much as before. Also I live in a small community and I have to ride my bike half a mile to town hall to visit an inn and find traces. Also you have to spend money to fill energy.          Other than that whole paragraph this game is great. You should try adding a hogsmeade. Thank You for taking your time to read my Review and I hope you take my suggestions into consideration.                           -Addicted Player I really enjoy playing this game...it‚Äôs fun, I enjoy the story line, picking a profession, and all that stuff.  However, there are a few things that I think would make the game significantly better.  1) It‚Äôs been said by many already‚Äîspell energy.  Can their be other ways to obtain this?  Specifically for people in rural areas where inns and greenhouse and few and far between.  Can we earn like 1 spell energy every 30 minutes or something?  It would be awesome to be able to wake up with a full energy bank each day, and would also make me want to play the game more frequently because I know that I could. 2) Can Masterful casts actually mean something?  It‚Äôs pretty stupid that a low level threat can resist a masterful cast.  What‚Äôs the point in trying to get a masterful cast if all you get is XP?  There is literally no other perk, as it doesn‚Äôt at all seem to affect your likelihood of capturing a foundable.  I have defeated a high level threat on a ‚Äúgood‚Äù cast, but had a low level threat depart after a masterful cast?  Seems stupid and pointless to have casting ability only count toward XP. 3) Storage.  I know this has been said by others as well, but it‚Äôs annoying to constantly have to delete ingredients/potions...particularly if you‚Äôre trying to stock up for a Wizard battle.  I realize this is to make people spend actual money buying coin to increase their storage, but it really makes me want to play the game less...not more. I agree that it‚Äôs a lot of fun for Harry Potter fans, and there are a lot of fun features. But in the American version, it‚Äôs hard to find inns unless they‚Äôre literally right there (within a mile) because you can‚Äôt zoom out on the map in game to find an inn nearby (I.e. within 5 mi) (and the online maps don‚Äôt work well either). I also don‚Äôt like that the game isn‚Äôt as intuitive as Pok√©mon Go‚Äîthere‚Äôs a learning curve, and right now I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm doing or how to work things. It would be nice if here was somewhere to go to review the storyline as well, because there‚Äôs a lot of moving pieces and it‚Äôs a little hard to follow. Also, the graphics are shoddy in some places (especially the people‚ÄîGinny was very slender in the movies, yet she looks overweight in the graphics, Luna is only recognizable because she‚Äôs he only one that wears that hat, Neville does not look all there, etc.). and the profile pictures will update on our personal app, but our friends can‚Äôt see it (my husband and I play together, and we will have to show each other our phones to show each other our profile pics). I realize it‚Äôs like this in Pok√©mon Go too, but I also don‚Äôt like that you would regularly have to travel to different countries to get everything (e.g. that awesome opal eye dragon in about a week). So you would have to be incredibly rich to get everything. BUT there‚Äôs a lot to do and explore, and I am mostly having fun with it. Requires iOS 10.0 or later.

It feels pretty fluid and easy to comprehend. There are plenty of changes from the physical version of the game but it is to make it faster for mobile which I understand. Some things that I wish we're different: - sentinels should be allowed to activate whenever you want. Some instances I want to use it before the triggered activation like staying under 4 damage. - I would prefer if cards added to hand on trigger checks. I understand why they are not but it would be nice. - pull rates for RRR cards need to be increased or a different system to purchase packs.Those are my biggest gripes with the game but overall I'm very pleased. The graphics are great, gameplay is quick and clean, ranked play seems pretty good so far. Good job. 4/5. The game is cardfight everything about it is what I loved yet the gameplay and game mechanics from the store to the missions and everything in between is really confusing it looks like it should be played like the tcg yet it‚Äôs really different once you play and the ai helps you a lot that should be a good thing it‚Äôs not does not let you play the way you want and don‚Äôt get me started on how you obtain your cards the system is kinda weird and I think you can just get endless cards as long as you got the money to get them so you can just continue to get cards you don‚Äôt want till maybe you get lucky and get one good card that you need there‚Äôs a lot of problems that can be changed and I just hope they change them before it‚Äôs too late I already spent 100 $ and trust me when I tell you that 100 $ in yugioh duel links goes a longer way then in here plz update the game clean up the rough edges make it more user friendly and better to understand I love vanguard but rn your better off playing the tcg then this and once again this does not follow the tcg rules it kinda change the way the game is played even tho vary small it big cuz it‚Äôs not the game I‚Äôm use to playing The game is fun and competitive but it shows a bit of favoritism towards certain clans, because I invested a lot of money on here and when I open up certain packs where it‚Äôs an event going on to support that clan like the Gacha pack for Dark Irregulars or Aqua Force but instead I get rare cards from different clans. I‚Äôm just saying, if the likelihood of getting that clan is boosted, then you should be able to get those cards. When playing the story or Character fights, the characters tend to get certain cards to their advantages and on Character fight-the higher the difficulty, the more power they get, that‚Äôs unfair because how you think people are going to be able to get 4 damage and beat them within 6 turns or less. I think that should be changed to at least starting off with damage. Giving them 1k and 2k is too much. If we can‚Äôt get the right cards from the packs and the game don‚Äôt offered better ways to give them out other than having an certain amount of VPs, then maybe it should be an event or reduce the amount of materials it takes to craft cards. They should add more items and cards onto the exchange store because it only got certain characters and cards to exchange coupons and tickets for.Also, it should be 5 tickets to be equal to one gacha ticket and maybe try fixing your shuffle system because you could discard a grade 3, just to get that same card back into your hand "

A simple, fun game to play in between boring classes and such, but recently they have been making it much too easy for new players. About a month ago, they had an event where over a month they gave out 200 magic stones (the in-game currency that usually costed money) and had a very good egg machine (where you could get new monsters), and my level one friend got some of the ten most overpowered monsters in the game, giving him a team nearly as good as mine. It was also sort of disappointing that he had enough starting team cost to be able to use them, where I recall two years ago grinding to level up to increase my team cost so that I could use my favorite monsters together, where he had to do nothing. One dungeon later, specifically and Experience of a Lifetime with x24 experience and a Ganesha as a helper leader, he was level 100 in his first day of playing with one of the best possible teams. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this game, but I‚Äôd love it a lot more if it felt like a i was rewarded at all for my years of grinding. The game very pretty balanced, and they will keeping adding new contents to keep things interesting, and they are very kind. They give players gifts! Last month or two, they game 100 gems, and now they gave 100 again! They just give you the gems and you get to choose what you want to do with them, but most players with just spend the gems on the dragonbound event. They also do collaborations with different anime! I would recommend this game, but it depends on you if your willing to spend your time playing it. I have been playing this game for almost 3 years, and in the beginning, I only used 5$, but it is unnecessary, since it is so easy to get gems now! You just need to know when to roll and create teams that work well with each other. There are also tutorials or examples of how to beat dungeons. Also, some cards sometime won‚Äôt be as strong as others in one dungeons, so that‚Äôs why you have to sometime make the best team within you collections to beat that dungeon. I truly enjoy this game but sadly, the Japanese server seems to get the better deal then the US server. I have no problem with that, but I still think it would just be easier to just have the contents as one. But overall, this is a great game. I‚Äôve seen more than a few comments flaming this game but, like others have said, it‚Äôs not for casuals. If you can put in the effort, it becomes worth your time and is extremely rewarding to clear some of the tougher dungeons. I‚Äôm still only around Lvl 170 and I can‚Äôt claim to have been playing for very long but I still have a great lineup for a team. Remember to always save up for events like godfest and monster hunter. DO NOT ROLL on other events, as many think the egg machines will give you good leaders no matter what, but it‚Äôs a complete trap to make you use up your eggs and thus take longer to progress. It also helps to do 2 player dungeons. I have a few friends who have carried me through dungeons I would never be able to complete on my own and that helps speed up the team building process as well. Look up events online and most definitely get a companion app for this game. I got Pad guide and it works great (free). Over all, remember to not give up and grind out the normal dungeons even though they may not seem worth it. Their point is to give gems, not monsters. SELL EVERYTHING but monsters you look up and will lead to a solid team lineup. You can farm for materials when the need arises. "

I do love this game a lot! But...a lot of the items on here are locked and I do not want to buy the full package. Maybe you could make some more of the items free. And when u are dressing up the groom and bride you can only watch one add for one of the items which means we would have to choose what we want. Cause what if we wanted both the lipstick and the eyelashes. And when u watch the add for the bride on the groom u can only have 2 choices hair, and facial hair. In my opinion I do not like facial hair. So if you are reading this please consider doing the things I have noted. I have only done about 6 wedding and it was very difficult to make them look decent with the little choices of dresses, hair, pants, etc. I also do not like how u have to watch adds in order to get the items. I know u want to advertise different games of yours but just make some more items unlocked. Please consider making some more items free and unlocked. Thank you for reading this whole thing I know it‚Äôs kinda long. Let me begin by saying that this app is by far one of the best free apps to offer what it does. However the fact that you guys are promoting that you have fixed the bugs on this app is a bit misleading given the fact that you have not. I was able to get through about 24 weddings and I am now unable to continue due to the same screen coming up even when I close out and reboot the app. It‚Äôs also unfortunate that you guys have us watch so many adds when the only things you offer as rewards should already be apart of the dressing options. As a business owner I understand the demand and promotion for paying further into the app but you guys are a bit over priced for what you‚Äôre offering. In conclusion I actually really enjoyed this game and the only tips I have for the wonderful people who created this app are as follows l: 1. More color coded free options with matching attire 2. There shouldn‚Äôt be more shorter hairstyles than longer given the fact that we are dealing with brides. 3. There should be matching attire items for each outfit chosen for the groom and bride and the bridesmaids and groomsmen to match accordingly. 4. Consider setting up adds to offer some of the things you are asking us to pay for, it supports the player to want to purchase further into what you are selling if they could at least try the locked outfits on. No further tips at this time. Thank you for the idea and the app that you have put out.       Best Regards, Brown Cosmetics Hey there,Thanks a lot for your helpful feedback. We're constantly working on making our game the best it could be!If you have any issues, please contact us at support@tabtale.com and we'll do our best to assist you.Thanks for playing!Dream Wedding Planner Team So i got this Game and it was so fun!! Until the thing I dread the most happened an add. Now I thought this was just a one time thing I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong I did watch adds to get stuff but this add came without me clicking a ‚Äú watch ad‚Äù icon. Then more and more came till my screen just went black I clicked my ho e button and then clicked the game again and guess what ..... it was still black. Anyways so I cleared my history and it worked but anytime an ad pops up the same things happen. Now I don‚Äôt know if it is just my device glitching or something else. Another thing is that the Ads are sometimes inappropriate and I don‚Äôt like I don‚Äôt know if y‚Äôall can change there being less ads but at least choose appropriate ones. Anyways but other than that it‚Äôs a great game I also have a suggestion you should have a thing to where you can dress your character. So yeah please fix thread situation and have a great day! "

It is very time consuming, but it‚Äôs worth it. There‚Äôs not a lot about this game I don‚Äôt like! I just wish that there was a way to get your little friend on his scooter to speed up refill time. And I wish there was a way to buy gold AND diamonds like a lot of in app purchases out there. I would really like to see some new strains added (if y‚Äôall still do those kinds of updates and additions to the game) like Girl Scout Cookies or Zkittlez or Blue Dream or Chocolate Mint OG etc etc. just add some new strains so that we don‚Äôt max out at 55 for growing and 56 for potted plants. I think that would be cool. Like let‚Äôs max out at like level 100 on both! Or if that‚Äôs too much, let us max out at like level 80. Just add some more strains and stuff please please please! Even in the candy machine we could make shatter chips or gummy bears. Or we could start making dabs in some sort of machine. The possibilities are endless because of this new day and age of the grass! It would be really fun to integrate those ideas! But other than that, this game is super fun!! Actually playing it now! Peace I have been playing for a long time now and am having so much fun with this game. I just have a really big issue, and that is I have way way too many materials (bolts, nails, boards, tape etc) they are taking up all of my storage. I could sell them all in the shop, but that would take hours and hours to do. Being such a huge level I open chests and get like 6000 a time. Please please add a way to delete items. I cannot play the game normally until I get room in my storage. The sales are way too slow you got to wait 7 days for a 24 hour sale that needs to be every 3 days! Great game been playing for years! Now when I got to the mailbox to buy more supplies the game freezes and I have to close it and open it up again...I‚Äôm level 233 and been waiting on the ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù update for quite a while now!!

A lot times you will work hard to upgrade multiple things, and when you go back to play the level, it still won‚Äôt let you pass. I played one so many times and didn‚Äôt even miss a note after upgrading 3 different costly things, and it failed me by probably 3 or 4 points. And if you don‚Äôt make any in app purchases, there is an ad literally after every ‚Äúshow‚Äù. Good way to pass the time, but definitely frustrating. Soon as you are 49/50, and on the last one of the recording studios, it don't let you pass it, even with 2 fully upgraded guitars, it puts a score so high, that even the best Pedals, and so forth, it's made sure you can not beat it. This is a fun game, very addicting, but to make it more successful, lower a little bit of the expected scores, even with all notes hit, you can't get past the score there. Also would be great if you could pick some of your own music, it would make it a lot more challenging as well, and also to compete with others on line, letting them pick a song, or you.  Also adding some more graphics, giving more stars then a couple a week, also more money, since that's all we do is spend money to upgrade the guitars, or buying drums, bass, amps, as well as band members etc... It‚Äôs good I love it. But, it could be a lot better if you guys didn‚Äôt make it so hard to get the credits cause I‚Äôm good at the game I could get most of the circles and miss one. But it‚Äôs hard to get enough of the points cause I can‚Äôt get enough points when it‚Äôs hard, at first I thought when it said hard that meant I just had to get most of the circles. Well I was wrong I had to get enough points to upgrade the guitar/equipment first then play and I can beat it. "

It had me first move the screen which I did and it worked; then it moved to dragging items around and that was when the app  started having some problems because if you drag the item the app doesn‚Äôt realize that so you are stuck on that.I had reported the problem to Apple explaining what was wrong and asking for a refund but instead they said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt qualify for a refund‚Äù so I have an app that doesn‚Äôt work and I won‚Äôt get money back cause I don‚Äôt qualify. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app because if it doesn‚Äôt work you won‚Äôt get the money back and you as well will be stuck with a app that doesn‚Äôt even work.

I‚Äôve played the original game for many years back in the day and it‚Äôs always been in my top 3 games from my childhood. It was one of the ones I had the most fun in. I coincidentally saw the game ad on instagram (funny to think about it), and I immediately thought ‚Äúit‚Äôs back?!‚Äù (kind of expected since many old games have been moving to mobile). I saw that the gameplay looked totally different and initially it threw me off because my dumb self was stuck with the original image of the game. After a while, I gave in and tried it out to see what it‚Äôs like, because who knows maybe I‚Äôll like it too. I couldn‚Äôt be more right, I‚Äôve been playing for almost a year already. The game keeps interesting since there‚Äôs always a sense of progression due to it taking reasonably long to evolve and having frequently updates. Also would not consider it pay to win (which is awesome), since paying seems more for speeding up growth and cosmetics. Although there are a few things that could be improved (no game is perfect), the staff does receive feedback with open arms it seems. So far, amazing mobile game, looks and feels really unique, and it‚Äôs very enjoyable! Great job! Hello Chaser! We are really pleased with your feedback. Thank you so much for your continuous support for our game since the PC version. We're glad you gave this game a chance so you can continue your wonderful adventures! Feel free to contact our support at grandchase_official@kog.oqupie.com for any concerns, questions and suggestions for our game. We're more than happy to assist you. Long live the Chase! Big player of Elsword and Grand Chase on PC. A lot of people‚Äôs initial reactions to this before its release was filled with lots of doubt, but I am very happy to say that it was misguided, elitist doubt. This game is very fun to play even for people who are not familiar with the story, and very free to play friendly! (At least, upon initially release. 2 weeks in, still find it very enjoyable.) I would not recommend buying 99% of the microtransactions because the ratios of premium currency to real currency are not great. If they were more generous with prices, they might find more sales for currency, though I believe most money is made on skins which is later on going to be in this game. Also, if you don‚Äôt like Gacha, maybe avoid imported games like this, but I would say there‚Äôs a lot of ways to chance your gacha, so P2W isn‚Äôt very dominant imo.From a gameplay and aesthetic perspective, I would say this is great mobile game, especially if you cannot afford to spend 24/7 attention to it. There is no stamina feature, so you can play as much as you want (or can, anyway) or as little, limited only by dungeon limits and the strength of your characters. There‚Äôs lots of ways to earn resources and it‚Äôs very satisfying to get them!My biggest tip for newer players: SAVE YOUR B-RANK HEROES! You can get 3k premium currency (equal to 10 rolls in gacha) if you save all the ones you get from the story and level them up all the way. I started playing the original grand chase back around 3rd/4th grade when ronan was first released and i was hooked on the game ever since. I played the game until the servers eventually closed and that wasnt the best of times. When i saw that this game was basically a sequel to the original game i thought ‚Äúdoesnt hurt to try it out‚Äù. The main thing that hooked me to the original game was all of the special events and armors/characters that you‚Äôd spend days collecting items for, the amazing community back when the servers were almost filled and the gm‚Äôs that would be around to chat with players and play alongside of the players. This game kinda brings me back to the old days especially with the soundtrack and the characters that i used to love playing(ronan,lass,asin,dio). It would‚Äôve been nice if players that originally played grand chase when it was on pc couldve had a chance to kinda get something to display that they have previously played the original game, but thats beside the point. The game definitely is fun and still addicting(probably becauae of nostalgia) but i have ran into problems. The game does really enjoy crashing whenever i play and i dont know if its an issue with my phone but it kinda ruins the experience. Hi Chaser! Welcome back to GrandChase!

‚ÄéThe Quest Classic - HOL IV,"The Quest Classic - Hero of Lukomorye, Part IV: Death to the Deathless is an expansion to The Quest Classic, a beautifully hand-drawn, immersive and enchanting world full of exciting challenges. After enabling the expansion, you can continue to play The Quest Classic with your existing character(s) to explore new areas and quests. However, if you don't have The Quest Classic, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game. You're called to the northern port of Seversk in deep winter to join the Tzar, his militia and navy for a final assault on the fortress of Kozney the Deathless.  Kozney has new allies, elves and dwarf blacksmiths, as well as the spirits of his mighty, cunning dragons to back him up. Enjoy one of Argimon's trickiest dungeons yet and learn Silvergirl's deathless secret. New monsters, new spells, roughly 60 quests will take you throughout a beautiful land, including a mysterious island, to the ocean floor and to the Underworld. To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select ""The Deathless"" as your travel destination. It is recommended to reach at least level 45 before trying to take on the challenges of this new expansion.

If you're familiar with this expansion on PC/Palm OS, this has been expanded from the original, so it's totally worth getting it again :). If you're new to the series, this works as a standalone game; as well as a further chapter in the series. The artwork is gorgeous, the creatures are amazing, and the game is played from your character's point of view, so you can get caught up in it. If you're a fan of role-playing games, you get the monsters, the weapons, and the epic battles. If you like something more cerebral, there are brain-twisting riddles, witty dialogue, and opportunities to craft a strategy. Game is absolutely amazing and for some reason looks better to me than the other quest games (textures seem to look more clear). The only rhing i disliked with all the quest games (i own all 8) is the stupid sicknesses. Please for the love of god add an option to turn them off and on. Zarista games keeps outdoing themselves with every new expansion to the quest. This one is by far the best yet. Great replayability too. The quests are challenging enough that you can play several times and still find it tough each time "

She storms a tower in search of dessert recipes and as you unlock recipes you unlock costumes for her. The graphics are top notch and there are 3 difficulties modes. You can save and quit to return your game at any time. I have not died so I'm not sure if you lose your inventory upon death. In this respect it may not be a true rogue like but who cares? The weapons and shields I have found actually change to what they look like when held. There are potions and scrolls of teleport and identify to be found as in classic dungeon crawlers. All in all this game is amazing and a steal at a buck. It is a girly dream come true for a gal that loves dungeon crawlers but I bet even boys would love this one ;)

It wasn‚Äôt just story it was the constant interaction of various elements that affected the routes you could take. Like (slight spoiler) in order to save a group of nomads you have to save up 2 points and invest them in charm otherwise you can‚Äôt save them or you if you kill off the bandits you can‚Äôt save the nomads. Along with a bunch of other stuff similar to that. It was a bit rough trying to figure out some stuff (although it wasn‚Äôt even that difficult) and map how to gain the most coin, items, equipment, interactions, exp, and fights in a single run, but once I figured it out it became a lot easier from there even to the point that endgame was became easy and I was pretty much rich. Tl:dr it‚Äôs an amazing, give it a shot, if you don‚Äôt like it by the time you have to pay, then don‚Äôt buy it. But as someone who did pay, it was worth it. Great job! Hi!Thank you for the kind words! We tried our best and I'm really happy you liked it. If you haven't already joined, we have a Discord server with loads of other players if you want to discuss possible secrets you might've missed out on or discuss lore etc. You'll find us at http://discord.untold-game.com/Adam This is such a cool game!There are a couple aspects that made me enjoy the game, first of all NO ADS. The game is only 5$ for the entire game, and it is definitely a smart move made by the devs Rather than spamming the game with ads. When a game has ads it makes the gameplay so much less... admirable. Every developer has to have a way to make money and this was the best approach.The gameplay itself is great as well, its a great and balanced game that is full of challenges! Rather than just winning every match you have to play with strategy and think about every move. Another cool aspect is the variety, there are different play styles for every body and for example you could be a brute with lots of health and dmg or a stealthy and agile character. If your a new player i have one tip for you, upgrade your perception at least a little, by doing this you can find extra content and find more secrets. All in all one of the best games ive ever played. UPDATE: Adam is amazing. I was pretty frustrated in my previous writing of this review and I actually emailed him (which I‚Äôve never emailed a game developer before). He responded right away and helped me get through my issue, which happened to just be me missing a step in the game process. My bad! I wanted to update this to 5 stars because every bit of this game and the developer deserve it. Keep it up Adam!!(This is my previous review, which I gave 4 stars) I love this game so far. The only thing (which I really hope the developer sees this) is I‚Äôm currently stuck in the crypts. Whenever I try to travel anywhere further it puts me right back in the crypts. I literally cannot continue the game because of this and I just spent $5 on it, so that‚Äôs annoying. PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP. Hi!I got your e-mail as well and have replied to it. Short version is: You need to enter the chapel, and exit it on the other end, and then continue.I hope this helps, if not, send another e-mail and I'll help you out!/Adam "

But what makes it a great game is the feeling of something original and fun. It goes towards the very basics of turn based gaming and is a roam type game which makes it even better. I had this game on a different account which was level 128, and now I‚Äôm starting over cause I lost my old phone... but never mind that. If you‚Äôre looking for a great game look no further. U may see people complaining about the energy system or ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù but this is neither of those. It has the option to buy things in the game, but honestly they don‚Äôt really help you. More of just a boost for an hour or two. And the energy, a lot of games use this to keep players from becoming super good within the first 45 minutes. This is purely so you don‚Äôt get bored and delete the game. This is a super fun game I honestly would recommend it to anyone who likes classical games. And don‚Äôt worry, the game is just like the video, no ripoff there ü•¥ The featured review talks about how if there wasn‚Äôt an energy limit you could just grind easily and get a ton of familiars except artificially increasing the length of a game is the biggest pay to win gimmick ever. The game is lazily made. I don‚Äôt mind the game itself but everytime I try and get a familiar it fails unless you bribe it with super hard to get gems. It takes ridiculous amounts of items just to upgrade one rare piece of equipment. You have to watch adds to get the rare gear because it‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôll even survive. Most of it is pay to win. There isn‚Äôt even a story! You could add a story that would take an hour to a week to write at most and essentially double the time without putting on an energy limit but that‚Äôs not going to happen because energy is how they make their money. The main way anyway. Oh, and the reason you have to grind for familiars is because of how rare they are even though they aren‚Äôt that useful they‚Äôre treated like gems and the game constantly rubs it in if you don‚Äôt have a full team of them. After the first two guaranteed familiars I completed the first map and guess what. I only got two familiar offers and they both failed when I tried to persuade them which by the way costs 1k gold and is rigged with a low success chance of about 40%. You can‚Äôt repeat levels, only dungeons and I never got another familiar offer from a repeated dungeon. It‚Äôs annoying, requires grinding, and get‚Äôs pretty boring when you add it all together. Let me fist start off by saying i really like the game The artwork The mechanics it all blends nice and well but what really makes this game frustratingly fun is the fact that you will find your self in pointless dungeon and grinding hours and hours just for a pice of loot or a ruin or other things you need to build up your character so he or her can become stronger and not die all the time like it happens to me but what‚Äôs really sad is the Energy is absolutely dreadful look I understand that the developers don‚Äôt want you wasting your time on a game but at the same time players like myself are really competitive and will stop at nothing until I achieve what ever my goal may be wither that be a ruin or a pice of armor you see what I‚Äôm saying I could go on about how much was promised but sooo little was given in return I really enjoy this game I do but it seems to me that the dungeons are really repetitive I almost feel bad for calling in other people to do my job for me I hope that both you there person that reads this and the developers that made this game takes the time to read this and get a little understanding of what people like have to deal with when it comes to bit hero‚Äôs so please all I ask of you developers is FIX YOUR GAME!!

But it never lets you eat the barito, the pizza or cookies. We should be free to eat what ever we want at the restaurant.2. I know I have the full version,but for those who don‚Äôt,you should make it free for them because poor people don‚Äôt have any money so if they want to buy the full version they have to pay! And they shouldn‚Äôt have to!3. We should be able to chat with people on the leaderboard.4. We also should be able to have more events because I don‚Äôt want to be stuck on the floor exercise. How about the uneven bars, the balance beam, and the vault? It would be very cool if we had more events.5. Ok this one is a BIG problem. Every time I leave the training place,the game crashes. Same with the spa. It keeps crashing and I have to train all over again because it probably won‚Äôt save. Speaking of the events, gymnastics superstar has the floor,bars,beam,and vault. Can you please have the same as them? Because I love gymnastics superstar also and I play it almost every day. Along with this game, I probably play it like two times a week. If you update the game and have more events and fix the crashing issues, I will play this game every day. Same with gymnastics superstar. I love both games. Well, the rest of this game is a wonderful success. I really like this game accept the adds. I play this game a lot and you watch adds more than you do anything else. You watch an add when you get out and in of something and when you want something and it is free you will get it but you still have to watch an add. And if you want a place you have to watch ten adds! I would rather watch five or six but ten!? Who the heck came up with that?! If you see this please, please, please fix the whole add thing. It is very annoying. Also, every time I don‚Äôt do what they want to do I get kicked out. I really need you to fix this game. Even though I never played superstar gymnastics I would rather have that.

I will pay more if I can get two more features added please:1. Be able to switch off 'local echo' so it does not put up on the screen what I am typing.2. Be able to log in a txt file what comes up on the screen.  Turn log on/off feature.Unable to get app support or developer webpage, 404 error. So, I downloaded this thinking that I could play my favorite games and it would work with voiceover. I was wrong. It will not even get me to the settings menu. Can we please have this fixed? I'd like to be able to play my games on my iPhone and not have to go through this hurdle of navigating the app just to read events that take place. Its easyer if the app speaks the messages out as I am typing or something. I don't even have echo support because I can't even get to the app settings.

The game itself is great, highly addicting and superb replay-ability (since it‚Äôs impossible to play the same game twice), and the majority (if not all) of the game has been refined to its best state. When the iOS port was announced and subsequently released I was ecstatic, and bought it immediately! However, as it‚Äôs meant for smaller screens and played with fingers, the port needs, in my opinion, some QoL changes to help the UI feel more friendly. First, many of the options in both the main menu and in other locations with small text are too small to comfortably use, as misclicks are all too often. Second, as others have said before, the card selection mechanics are a bit wonky ; to elaborate, there are multiple times I select a card to read it‚Äôs use, but then wish to play a different card. Due to the selected card hovering around my card-hand area, it makes it difficult to select a new card to play (especially with cards that can be played just by placing them on the field; those have a tendency to be played instead of de-selecting). Besides this slight nuisances and the occasional sound glitch, the game is amazing performance-wise for a full PC-to-iOS port! Must buy! Slay the Spire is a flawlessly designed and executed game. The only reason it didn‚Äôt receive 5 stars is because the developers were limited by the game itself. The genre‚Äîroguelike deck-builder‚Äîis brilliant and very innovative, but I can‚Äôt imagine any game of either of these genres receiving a perfect score. These genres, despite being fun and entertaining, lack the freedom to make a game that deserves a perfect score; one that‚Äôs not only fun, but exhibits emotion like Last of Us, tells a beautiful story like Half Life 2, or brings people together in some way like Rainbow Six Siege. The developers created Slay the Spire in the best way that anyone possibly could, they were only limited by their genre.The actual gameplay is fantastic. It‚Äôs snappy, self-paced, easy to pick up, very fun and casual, and can become as complex as you want, depending on your skill or effort. It has practically infinite replayability, especially with the inclusion of many modifiers and challenges and fascinating synergies.To consumers: it is worth noting that the cards can sometimes be difficult to accurately select on smaller devices. To avoid frustration or accidentally using the wrong cards, I highly recommend playing just a tiny bit slower to make sure you‚Äôre using the right cards. Edit:  upping my review buy one so as to t punish the amazing developers for a subpar port .  You do get accustomed to the crappy controls after a while. StS is one of my favorite PC games but playing on iPad is a pita because the card selection controls are so bad.  There are countless games where you have to read and select cards and I‚Äôve never once complained about how it was implemented.  The first issue is the text is off the screen (which is completely unnecessary on iPad).  So you have to tap to bring the card up (usually you just tap hold in games to read a card).  But it‚Äôs a fine line between whether the game thinks you want to read a card or use it.  Sometimes you think you‚Äôve dropped a card and go to play another but play the first card.  It‚Äôs just janky and sticky.   If you read a card that doesn‚Äôt require a target and tap to dismiss it, it plays it instead.  I‚Äôve played more wrong cards in this game in 5 plays then in every other deck builder combined over my entire life.  Fix it for five stars.  Also the sound is really tinny and there are some sounds that sound literally like static. "

The passenger should be seen at the back window and when a car turns to the left the driver and passenger should be seen and turning to the right the passenger should be seen. There should be people walking on the street and some crossing the street and when they are crossing the street and a car comes close to a crosser, the crosser starts to run. If it is a fast car,it would be a 50% chance the fast car would hit the crosser and the crosser falling to the ground dead and blood everywhere. Its a OKAY game. I have so many complaints. 1. The people were driving to their location are too slow and take forever. 2. When the other card crash into us WE are the people that lose our coins and its annoying bc it happens every single time I play 3. The lights take forever to go to green when no cars are passing by but! When its green it only turns green for like 2 seconds. 4. I was playing today and I couldnt move then all cars crashed into me and I lost so many coins! Also I lost coins from the street lights when I didnt go past it when I couldnt even move! Those are all my complaints about then hame other then the the game its good or great its just fine and okay and watch out for these stuff so you can report it and hopefully THE CREATOR FIXES IT if not im deleting it because its annoying and im tired of it! Ughhh. You read what I had to said. To the creator: PLEASE IM BEGGING YOU please look through it and fix it please. Thank you After playing this game for some time, there are many flaws. First the people are very slow and sometime act like there going to fall over. Also, the cars don‚Äôt turn like there supposed to and the reverse sometimes doesn‚Äôt work. Also, when I was do the parking part of the game the barriers were sometimes too close together and I couldn‚Äôt get through, but that wasn‚Äôt even the bad part there were like some kind of clear thin barrier on top of it making my car crash even though I had about a half a inch until I would hit the barrier. Also, I have been playing this game since the begging of summer and it had erased all of my progress! Witch made me supper mad! Also, I had gained the two levels that you had to pay for because I had got them as my daily gift and I only ended up getting one level which is not what I should of got. I would not recommend this game also because of its adds because there were way too many of them! Please do not buy this game!!!üò° "

I have been playing on and off since it‚Äôs release, and just finally got a new phone and have been playing for about 2 weeks straight and noticed some things that could be improved. For example, this game could use some improvements for newer devices in particular. While I do understand this game was released in 2015, and quite frankly, is somewhat an inactive seeming game, but it would be nice if newer devices such as the iPhone X, XR, XS, and XS max had controls to match the devices size. It is quite frustrating to have to rotate my phone a certain way to play the game effectively, and parts of the screen being cut off, even if it is a small amount. I would suggest moving the buttons to locations where they won‚Äôt be cut off by the bar at the top, and moving them away from the corners of the devices which are curved, resulting in parts of buttons being cut off and having a less sleek looking game design. Thanks for taking my opinion to heart. -Reviewer I have been playing for 3 and a half years and yes it WAS fun. When you see these games your excited but if your play for 2 years and over you will probably be bored. Why am I bored it's because there is no new cars, no new challenges, and no new places. There wasn't a huge update or even small update the creator needs to update. If you don't update your games it starts to get boring. Then nobody will play your game. You know those games that you really want to play and you see in the videos, for example Grand Theft Auto, it's fun but you can't find anything like that game. Why don't you buy Gta then? Well parents sometimes don't allow you to buy such bloody games. This game at first was a dream and that means I don't have to search car games. Fast forward 3 and a half years later it gets boring. No updates no nothing. If your game has no updates then you have to delete the game cause you finished the game already. And also will take some of my storage. If you want to keep that game, it has to mean something not just junk that you don't use. Creator if you are reading this listen,  ( you are probably not) make a big update. Also make more games that have cars. For example Extreme Car Driving Simulator 2020 This game is a classic that I have been playing for a long time. It‚Äôs great and really fun with tons of cars. I have a couple of suggestions that would make it even more awesome and hope developers see this. 1. Police chase. I think it would be awesome to have a mode where you could be chased by the cops. 2. More places to go. The city, airport and off road are all great places with tons of stuff to do, but once you‚Äôve played those it gets a little boring. I would add on to some places or create a whole new place.3. Easier to get cars. I don‚Äôt mind driving a certain number of miles and collecting the car parts but, if you want all of the cars you have to watch a ton of ads to eventually build up in game cash or pay real money. I know you guys have to make money but I would at least put someway in the game you can earn cash, instead of just ads, and make more cars able to get cash. Other than that, a very very good game that I can not stop playing. Hopefully developers see this and if so thanks for years of fun and I hope my suggestions are helpful! "
‚ÄéStradale Racing Simulator,"This is the racing sim that >I< think we need. The physics are as realistic as those in X-Plane, with engine power, tire cohesion, and aerodynamic drag and downforce all accurately modeled. The tracks are the most fantastic things I could dream up... tracks that... COULD exist. Now, with 500+ horsepower supercars and realistic physics, you can tackle those tracks that only exist in our imagination, but COULD be built in reality if we ever dared... And, with in iPhone 6+ and a cheap Google Cardboard headset, you can do the whole thing in 3-D VR... which is really quite amazing. The world looks HUGE in there!",https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/81/12/8d/81128df5-4c3b-d053-d77a-6597270a9714/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-85-220-0.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.4 ‚Ä¢ 31 Ratings,$1.99,,"December 16, 2019","This is a very fun and at points challenging. One thing that would make it a bit more fun would be more customization option that could even tweak each cars performance a bit more like aerodynamics or engine tuning. The graphics aren't the best but this game is awesome. I got all 12 cars available. It has a mode where you can make your own track. It also has a BNSF train. I think there is about 7 different types of trains. I highly recommend getting this game. It also has down force physics. When it says that thing about fantasy violence it is just some red that comes up on the screen when you crash. The cars can be hard to control so I recommend this game for people 12 and up. If you have an iPhone 6+ you can put in the Google cardboard thing if you know what that is. Please support this company and get this game so they can make more. I'm really enjoying Stradale on my iPad Air 2. It reminds me of the Atari classics Hard Drivin' and Race Drivin', both of which took care to simulate core driving mechanics as accurately as the technology allowed, but with crazy tracks. The controls are accurate - I'm finding virtual buttons for gas and brake with tilt steering emulates the driving experience well. And it's hard! Which is refreshing - a lot of us grew up with games that made no effort to hold your hand and this carries on that tradition. Trying something again and again until you nail it is immensely more satisfying than being assisted by a malleable A.I. that wants to give you a participation award. "

Also, im really not sure what the tier up level does for the builders as there is no help screen. But i love this game so much as there is no forced ads. And no forced buying to progress in the game. As the title says, this game is fun for the first bit. I opted to pay the ~$8 for the double income and the ad-free gameplay; it speeds up the game, but now after running through the 21 levels about 6 times, I have maxed out the facility and supporters pages so I have no use for the gems you get at the end of each stage(10k+ in storage). Also I have maxed out the worker page at 100 ranks in speed and cash, with 160+ workers. So now I have nothing to buy apart from a worker every couple of levels, but I just keep building the same 21 buildings over snd over... this game needs more variety in levels and something else to spend gems on as even without paying for the ad-free you could still run out of things to use them on by the 10th playthrough. Now I‚Äôm not talking about completely removing ads 100%, that‚Äôs just stupid. I‚Äôm talking about removing ads from the upgrade buttons. Remove the ads from menu button. Stop reskinning games for a quick cash grab. If you spent half as much effort in making a good game with NON-INTRUSIVE ads you‚Äôd make so much more money due to more people playing, watching ads they want to watch, and buying packs of in game items.Look at games like Egg Inc., Pick Crafter, and a whole slew of others. Look at Crossy Road. No intrusive ads and it made over a million in the first year it was available.This game and plenty of others like it will keep getting 1 star reviews from me until the devs learn to properly implement ads.

My internet is slow so it sometimes glitches a bit but I can‚Äôt complain, overall it‚Äôs one of the best online survival games ever. I enjoy playing with friends and creating things and I don‚Äôt mind if they are destroyed because I can always rebuild and that‚Äôs the fun of itüòÑ I just have a few suggestions on different things you could add in the future: flying animals; there are no creatures that fly in the sky, I think it would be fun if there were bats or something that attack you. I love a challenge! Or maybe be able to shoot down birds with a bow when you hunt instead of shooting chickens that sit on the ground. Water creatures; I know adding these things make it more like Minecraft but if you don‚Äôt make them look or act exactly like the Minecraft mobs it wouldn‚Äôt seem like the same game, can we pls have a fishing option to make a rod and go fishing?! What is the point of the water if there isn‚Äôt anything living in it! Anyway I have other ideas but I don‚Äôt want to bother! Great job with this game it beats all! Thx! I absolutely love this game! But the glitches are driving me nuts the lucky blocks are really fun but most of the time it spawns witches and skeletons with full chain armor. Please raise the probability in getting something good. Another thing is that I can‚Äôt seem to change from creative to survival or survival to creative please fix this it‚Äôs bugging a lot. I also think that the spiders in the game should not have potions like invisibility. For some reason I can‚Äôt go through the portal every time I try it doesn‚Äôt take me anywhere. It‚Äôs very strange. I want to be able to craft more items like soul sand or something like that. I also HATE that behind every diamond there is freaking lava! I don‚Äôt want my diamonds to disintegrate. The chances of you actually finding diamonds is very VERY low. I also don‚Äôt understand why there are emeralds in creative but they don‚Äôt exist in survival. Other than that the game is REALLY REALLY REALLY glitchy. I swear my cousin almost lost his diamond cause he couldn‚Äôt move and a freaking zombie was attacking! I wish I could give this five stars but these glitches are making me change my rating by the way i love the new update for enchanting thank you for reading I hope you see this and fix the things the thing I want most is to change from creative to survival and survival to creative. Dear customer!Please, send your cousin our contact(sergey.levchuk@solverlabs.com) to share a detailed description of the issue, OS version so that we can help her fix all problems. Please explore the world more by foot or teleport through portals to find more minerals. We will take your wishes into attention in future updates! Stay tuned! We hope that you will improve your review. Heyyyy! So I started playing this game because originally I wanted minecraft, but I couldn‚Äôt, so I scrolled down and found this game. I thought hmmm okayyy well this will work I guess, and I also thought it would just be a rip-off version of Minecraft, but to this day, I still play it!!! I have been playing for almost 2 years now, and even though this isn‚Äôt Minecraft, it‚Äôs really good! The only thing that I with there was is horses you can actually ride, and you can make saddles, carrots on sticks, be able to maybe actually become friends with, tame, and ride scorpions and also go fishing. Other than that, I will say that you definitely need to play this great amazing game!! You don‚Äôt even need to pay for it, and you can remove ads if you save up enough coins. I am also glad that they don‚Äôt pay or influence people to write good fake reviews. Come and totally play this game!!! "

There aren‚Äôt enough survival games styled like this and I‚Äôd love to see this game become more developed because I really think it‚Äôll become a popular game. It does need some work though. The graphics aren‚Äôt the greatest but graphics don‚Äôt need to be super great for a game like this. You just have to add more in game items and functions. If you need an example game look at Rust it would be the perfect game to get ideas from. Just start with small things like new upgrades for the bases you build, maybe a cave location or something and continue from there as the game gets better and bigger. This game always has a good amount of active people so I know as it gets better it‚Äôll get bigger. I‚Äôm honestly excited to see how much better this game gets in future. It‚Äôs a great game I love the concept of creating servers and joining them it makes the game more fun because it‚Äôs easier to play with friends and meet new people! The things that bother me are that if your hatchet breaks then your basically done for. You can fix this by making the hatchet permanent and you can‚Äôt remove it from your inventory even if you die. You can remove the crafting buttons for the hatchet and the problem is fixed! Another thing is that the ammo and arrows don‚Äôt do anything I spent so long trying to get ammo for my weapons until I found out that they did nothing, it‚Äôs a waste of material and it‚Äôs not the best idea to add. Especially if you use coins to buy them (which I don‚Äôt) and since coins cost money that‚Äôs basically scamming so you might want to get that fixed. And one more thing can you please make it so when you die you only lose some of your inventory. Example: I have a shotgun sticks and a campfire, if I die only take away some of my things like since I have four items maybe take two? And if I have a even amount of items then take half. It‚Äôs simpler and it will make the game more fun!! Thank you and I will read your comment if you respond. This game me and my friends love this survival game so much because there‚Äôs a lot of stuff to do but we have been looking for a survival game for a long time and this came up we tried and fell in love all the problems we had with it was that we would get furnace glitches, laying on the ground, and we just want more stuff cause when you get all the good items you run out of stuff in the game so please developers please work on more updates I don't  expect you to respond fast and do it we are all going through this together and it will stop eventually but here‚Äôs a game to look at to get some ideas this survival game is called rust it‚Äôs on steam so look at it and maybe play it and get some  ideas they have a lot of stuff on that game so please look at it and get some  ideas for update on your game thank you for this game it‚Äôs good I love it. üòç "

The ATS game-- replicates actual operations of switch rails, signals and crossing gates. reproduces passing loop on a single line, train overtaking, and stop signals before arriving at terminals. uses transition curves on railroads to offer very gradual curve. gives you general idea of how signals and safety equipment work. lets players know why it takes extra time during rush hour.

‚ÄéAlmost a Hero - Idle Click RPG,"Almost A Hero is an idle RPG clicker game of epic proportions where some of the most useless dimwits embark on a quest to be slightly less useless. They say never give a loser an even chance. We say different. A bunch of deeply unique and deeply flawed individuals have been chosen for greatness. Heroic, noble, enlightened... Just 3 of the many words they can‚Äôt spell. Combine them seemingly cleverly to beat endless waves of enemies in multiple modes - find your own way of hoping to make good use of them only to be taught otherwise painfully. Join these zeroes on a quest to become heroes in an ancient land. Train them to learn battle skills, magical powers and which end of a sword is the business end. In Almost A Hero you‚Äôll find quests, secrets to unlock and there's lots of clicking to do. Yup, it‚Äôs a clicker game, an idle one. Have you nearly got what it takes to maybe, under certain circumstances, potentially become almost a hero? ‚ÄúI‚Äôd challenge you to a battle of wits but I see you came unarmed‚Äù - Wendle the Wise",https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/86/a4/31/86a43127-2eab-3c81-e906-68736efd567a/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-7-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png,"Upgrades, Battles, Heroes",4.8 ‚Ä¢ 12.6K Ratings,Free,,"October 2, 2020","The game is very good for what it is(an idle game for you check on while waiting in line at the store or while you sit upon the porcelain throne) the art is very good and the characters are unique for example one of the goblin hero‚Äôs items required to evolve him is a prosthetic leg despite him not being an amputee which is funny because it implies he stole someone‚Äôs prosthetic leg.the only issue I have had so far is that when watching ads for diamonds there is one ad that crashes the game(its an interactive ad for world war rising) and doesn‚Äôt reward you with diamond so if the devs read this I suggest you either stop running that ad or you look into what‚Äôs causing the issue to occur because it is very discouraging as the game runs the same ad if you close the game and try again the only way to get past this is to wait a few hours before trying to watch another ad (from a business standpoint it is critical that you fix this it is incredibly discouraging to watch ads when I know I might just be wasting my time) I have tried this on an iPhone 10, iPhone 6, and a friends Samsung tab 4. I was not able to get the ad to run on the iPhone 10 so I have no idea if this happens there to but the bug does read occur on Android(granted the tab 4 is very outdated so that might just be a device issue)In short awesome game minus the one bug. Highest level I‚Äôve achieved is 600. So I‚Äôve played this a rather fair amount. I‚Äôve played a ton of tap games. The concept is ideal for me. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I am forced spend a lot of time in an app, but knowing I can if I want to. I don‚Äôt want to feel like no progress is made in my short play sessions, so in and so forth. Tap games are my best friend. That being said, THIS IS MY FAVORITE ONE!! The art style really sells this game. The characters have charm. They have purpose. You get attached to certain characters and really understand their strengths and weaknesses EASILY. The same cannot be said for other games in this genre. You end up with sprawling hordes of guys you don‚Äôt remember and you spend the time dumping resources into min/maxing a bunch of rando characters you don‚Äôt give a rip about. You certainly spend some time doing that in this one, but the 5-man team is PERFECT. It‚Äôs digestible, user-friendly, and you actually give a crud about your characters, leveling them up, working on their equipment. Brilliant. Great game. From one industry dude to another, kudos to the team that made this. I love rpgs and I love idle games, especially now that I‚Äôve seen the combination of the two. But this game has to be my favorite.So many things to upgrade, over a thousand levels, and multiple quest types. This game really has it all and I‚Äôm happy I get to enjoy watching simple side characters rise to greatness. I love all the characters especially Vexx‚Äôs quips and Lia‚Äôs design. The only problem I have is with Redroh. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like most of what he has to offer like the ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù and ‚Äúeasy targets‚Äù combo. But I‚Äôve noticed that though he‚Äôs a treasure goblin, 6 of his skills affect gold, while 7 affect offense. I feel as though he could use a little touch up as I planned to keep him in my party. But spending his perks and items on ‚Äútrade secret‚Äù and ‚Äúconfusing presence‚Äù feels like a big waste. I‚Äôve even considered switching him out for Uno or another support characters, but I wanna like him. I hope you see this, and thank you for your time and game! "

I will say that none of Gluten Free's games work on iPod 4 or lower, but that's as much as I know about compatibility. The noises could be better. The dragon's roar is just... AWFUL, and sounds like its roaring from its arse! As an example, Skyrim dragons have some wicked roars and such, but certainly don't copy off of them! And also, the family's a little glitchy. Like, when they are flying in your home even when they should be walking. Or flying on one of the islands when you are walking. I laugh when a sheep runs off their floating island to escape, just to fall to their death! It would nice if your loot could show up inside your house, like it should the way you have dragons. It would be cool if, when you defeated the ""Dragon King"" (inferior when you're at Lvl 50), you became the Dragon King. Or at least were dubbed as the Dragon King. Other then some other things that others could name, this game is worth the money! I love this game, I can sit around and play this game for hours, days, but there are some problems, When u buy the color white for ur flames, it still won't let u use it, and it says it's still locked, also, I don't think that the castle people, like the Knights, mages, and archers should attack u unless u attack them or the castle first, or roar. The roar is fine except it needs to sound deeper, not as high pitched as it is, and when ur  standing or flying, I don't like how the mate and the baby dragons r flying or standing on top of one another, same thing with the wolf game, also, why is the mate so much smaller than u, its just plan weird, this is an amazing game, but it does need some fixing, so please have an upgrade soon, I also think that there should be more levels, instead of just the one, and when u kill the dragon king, I think you should become the dragon king, the dragons face is shaped weird, but I love it to be honest, this game is worth the money but still, please fix it up üêâüòã‚ù§Ô∏èüòáüê≤ K, so my T-Rex family is level 32 and lower and my dragon family is capped at fifty. And I had the dragon game for less time. I do think there's a level imbalance here, I think exp for the dragons should be harder, treasure more challenging to get/prices higher or maybe make the game free so people can use this speedy ""sim"" to get a tantalizing taste of Gluten's games. Still has the white fire bug, but I don't even think I've had this game a week so I doubt it'd be fixed in that short of time. Though I'll still care for my dragon family (I'm the sort of dingus that gets attached to freakin' pixels), but now there's really no place to go with this so it's short lived, too fast or just empty. Would love to see more done with this. Maybe an achievement system. Kill Dragon King x amount of times, get his coloration for your dragon. Kill basilisk x times, get snake pattern armor. Etc. just something to add to this game. "

And this is one of the few games that actually supports my device‚Äôs native resolution and I get a beautiful full screen, without any ugly black bars that even BILLION dollar game developers, cannot seem to take the time to get it right lol..THIS GAME DOES. It actually utilizes the power of my device, and runs butter smooth while doing so! I‚Äôve owned my iPad Pro 11‚Äù 1TB since around January of 2019. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever felt my iPad get warm lol. Not hot, but just warm, yes the first time ever! Lol! So, that tells me this game is using my iPads beastly A12X CPU, and wicked awesome GPU, and some of the 6GB of ram that I have. I love this game, I was just playing it for about 20 minutes, and I just had to minimize, and come back on the AppStore to write a review about it. Excellent game developers right here! Very smooth! Very fluid, excellent graphics! This developer needs to make a ‚ÄúFirst Person Shooter type game‚Äù they would blow PUBG out of the water! PUBG still has big black bars on my iPad Pro 11‚Äù 1TB and they‚Äôve yet to add support for my native resolution even after nearly 5 months since launch. Thank you for making a game that shows off our devices so well! And please, try and make a different game GENRE. YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST!!! I love your game but I feel it is missing a bunch of other iconic jets. I do understand your game is still being worked on and I can‚Äôt wait so see what other planes will be added!I hope to see this game advance, it has a lot of potential! If possible I‚Äôd love to see helicopters at some point.  My overall rating on this game is 5 stars, it‚Äôs a really beautiful game and I love the jets in the game. I haven‚Äôt lagged much while playing this game either with only one or two of the occasionally lag spikes. I‚Äôd like to see a radar guided gun for some of the jets as it would make some jets easier to aim with, like the lower tier jets. Giving lower tear jets easier to aim weapons would make it a little easier to progress. Alliance credits, in my opinion the alliance credits are way to hard to get a lot of. Please make these credits a bit more numerous as upgrades get pretty expensive and it takes a long time to get these credits. I do love the Ace battle mode as it does pump out a lot of credits if you can avoid a lot of missiles. This is all I have to note on this game, I love the game, and keep up the hard work! Don‚Äôt rush this game as I may lose quality if it is rushed! Thanks. Overall this game is really ‚Äúfilling‚Äù, and fulfills all most of my expectations. The graphics are like what it says in the description: photorealistic. There are no ads in game to disturb your gameplay (in my experience), and it is a really smooth game. Although right now the game is good enough, I would really want more content and missions, though I know they would be coming in future updates. It would really improve the game if you could add historical campaigns (for the time periods that actually happened, like WW2), bombs that you can drop from planes, ground forces like tanks and infantry that you can support or fight, carriers and landing strips that you can return to in order to repair, and/or switch planes, and finally, an improved multiplayer feature, as the current one is pretty laggy.

It‚Äôs a fun business manager with a bit of challenge. $1.99 is good for no adds as well. It is weird how I couldn‚Äôt find the game in the search after purchasing it as well? I stumbled on it by accident somehow and I‚Äôm glad I bought it when I found it. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with that, but keep up the work guys. It‚Äôs great. The game starts off well enough and it‚Äôs fairly easy to figure out how to navigate once you play for a bit. It‚Äôs enjoyable to build up your coins and spend them on improvements, more staff and of course more fish which in turn leads to the ability to generate more coins. That‚Äôs really it though - the game is the same all the way through and you huff and puff to build up coins to buy the same things that early on in the game costs 100,000s or millions cheaper. After spending enough time on this game to fill my sea water tank of fish, I don‚Äôt see anything more than the same gameplay repeating itself until I suspect I have obtained several million to have a marine tank and extra staff, etc. The game needs more variation to keep it interesting and it has no replayability value. For a paid game, I was hoping for more. I love the fact that this game covers the basic foundation to running a business! It‚Äôs so addictive and it can actually teach you something! The only thing that upsets me is how the App Store buried this game! I typed Aquarium Tycoon in the search bar but it never came up... I had to go into purchases to find this game to leave a review. It goes to show how much I really love this game!!! Thank you! Thank you for the great review! You are the first reviewer abroad, we are very glad to read this compliment..! We also hope there will be a time that Appstore list us to the top soon!Thank you again, and please enjoy our game :D "

In this Wildlife game the hammer & paintbrush are right together. This is a problem for people with larger fingers because it‚Äôs easy to accidentally hit the wrong button if you are 1 millimeter off on your touch.I prefer the FlipPix Art puzzles that have the hammer at the bottom of screen & paintbrush at top (like in Country Life) so there‚Äôs no chance of inadvertently tapping the wrong one. However, the fact that the location of the hammer is different in different FlipPix art puzzles makes it difficult to switch between puzzles because you get use to hammer in one location, then on a different puzzle it is in a different location. I wish all the Flip Pix art control buttons were in uniform locations from puzzle to puzzle. "

I have been playing for like less then 20 minutes and I already have everything in it. Like there are probably about 7 items you can crush and 3 cars you can buy. One thing I also have a problem with is that when it says you can boost stuff it doesn‚Äôt do anything , I mean maybe it‚Äôs just me but when I tried to boost my car speed it did nothing. I think this game has a lot of potential if some of these problems were fixed. Thank you for reading this. It‚Äôs okay for a free game but it was honestly a bad game. Everything you had to play for a long time to get, it takes forever and it‚Äôs just not a good app. I do not recommend this to you because the car goes so slow and the crushing is not satisfying enough for my liking. If the creator(s) could make the tho game you could get cheaper I would have liked it better. If you do not want to listen to me saying it‚Äôs not worth your time then so be it and get it but I can guarantee some won‚Äôt like it Ok I‚Äôm very picky to all games, but I love how smooth running the game is! And how it just does as its supposed to. No glitches as far as I‚Äôve seen! Thing is, there is little things to buy. Maybe adding more things (foam, and other such items) outta bring more people to this game. Other than that, I think this is a good family game, and it should be more and more greater in the future!

‚ÄéTank Battle: Pacific,"Ask most historical strategy gamers about World War Two and not many would have thought there were any tank battles in the Pacific Theatre of World War Two.  They did happen, and they happened often, but they never matched the scale of the Western Theatre.  Starting in China in the 1930's the Chinese engaged the Japanese using Russian T26's and German Panzer I's.  The Japanese fought the Russians in 1939 and 1945, the Soviets with the one of the world's greatest generals, Zhukov, in command! In 1941 the French in Vietnam briefly fought the Japanese with World War One era tanks.  In Burma and India, British Commonwealth forces regularly engaged in battle using equipment that would have been considered obsolete on the West Front.   Finally the titanic struggle between the Japanese and United States of American resulted in dozens of tank engagements. Even the Island War battles saw some engagements with over 30 Japanese tanks in a single mass assault.  Tank Battle: Pacific attempts to create many of these battles with a mixture of historical battles and themed scenarios that capture the experience of being a tank commander in the Pacific Theatre in World War Two. Fight battles between Japan, France, China, Russia, British Commonwealth and The United States of America.  The game has a wide range of features from the tank battles of Northern Manchuria to the battlefields of Burma and the landings on the Pacific Islands.  The game even includes a what-if scenario for Operation Olympic, the invasion of the Japanese homelands.  The game system is a major upgrade of the already successful Tank Battle game engine from HexWar. Key Game Features: ‚óè 15 Missions to play through, including 2 large-scale beach invasions. ‚óè Play as the Japanese in the 8 Mission ‚ÄòFirst Strike‚Äô tutorial campaign, concluding with a full-scale mission. ‚óè Play as the Chinese versus the Japanese in the ‚ÄòBonus‚Äô Campaign (1 Mission). ‚óè Play as the Japanese versus the French, then Chinese, then Americans in the 3 Mission ‚ÄòRising Sun‚Äô Campaign. ‚óè Play as the Americans versus the Japanese in the 3 Mission ‚ÄòEclipse‚Äô Campaign. ‚óè Over 123 unique units! ‚óè High Definition World War II era graphics. ‚óè Specialist units such as LV'Ts (Landing Craft Tank), LVCP's (Landing Craft), Engineers and the ubiquitous LVT (Landing Vehicle Tracked) ‚óè Japanese bunkers and other fortifications. ‚óè Japanese Infiltration units. ‚óè Japanese 'Nikuhaku' anti-tank suicide units. ‚óè High Definition grassland and beach terrains. ‚óè Four troop classes; Raw, Average, Veteran and Elite. ‚óè Other Game Features; detailed combat analysis, flank attacks, strategic movement, indirect fire, mounting and dismounting from vehicles, multi-level hills and minesweepers. ‚óè Hours of game play. ‚óè Map zoom.

I mean little. There is one tutorial and two campaigns included, another campaign that can be unlocked if you give up your email address and three more you have to buy. I'm not saying it's not worth it, but it was disappointing to find so little gameplay in the original purchase. I play a lot of hex war games and this may be my favorite one of the tank battle series because of the amphibious landing scenarios. But, they only give you two 3-game episodes and one bonus game. Every additional episode is an add on for pay. This is not a good value as far as these games go.  I would have given 5 stars but for that. This game is great. I've played all the WW2 versions and enjoyed them all. I'm actually kinda addicted I think, since I'm always checking to see if more have been added. Please make more of them, a battle of the bulge, maybe a larger scale European and pacific battle. Hell even a sea battle would be amazing! "

But there‚Äôs a few things that needs to be added! Their should be a reverse camera added or a camera to where you can move the head from side to side when turning into the opposite lane . And also I‚Äôm just waiting for more cities to be added ! It would be great if y‚Äôall would add TEXAS ! To be more specific (Houston, Dallas (Make sure AT&T stadium is added . Also when it comes to picking up the passengers In the game pick a side where the passenger is standing instead of me having to turn my whole car around doing a u turn but that‚Äôs it. Also no time limiting when taking the passengers to their destinations . Can you also put in China and New Jersey . Also it‚Äôs hard for me to see the traffic lights from the interior And y‚Äôall should really make the cities look like the actual cities and states y‚Äôall put and make the state name specific with the city name please . Or y‚Äôall should do all 50 states and add each specific city out of one . So the cars are nice. They look good without being cheap. But some stuff should be changed. One is that traffic lights are on EVERY SINGLE CORNER of a street so why not just use a few stop signs? Second, the cities are WAY to small. New York City in this game is about the size of Columbia, MO so it needs to be more life-size. Thirdly, there should be intersections and highways and you can actually drive across the U.S. and maybe even Mexico or Canada. Plus there should be that same option for South America, Africa, Asia and Australia and Oceania to make it more fun. Fourth, the pedestrians are really dumb and when some got out of my taxi, they would wander in circles like they are drunk or something. They also walk in front of my car randomly. EVEN when the light is green. Plus the taxi passengers won‚Äôt shut up. They keep commentating and it‚Äôs kind of unnecessary when they say stuff like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that funny smell in your car?‚Äù Or ‚Äúdid you reach the speed of sound yet.‚Äù So either just make so they don‚Äôt commentate or make an option where you can mute them. Plus why isn‚Äôt there a London map? And finally, you should make it so actual hours pass in the game. But otherwise it is a fairly good and fun game. I have had this game for about five months and overall it is pretty good the cars are pretty nice and expensive looking there are people and there is AI cars driving around. Ideas I have some ideas I want ovilex to make in the next update. I want the people or citizens to be smarter because sometime they just wander around and they constantly get stuck. The AI traffic is low poly and the texture isn‚Äôt good so I wish you would improve that I would also make people in the other cars and your character could exit the car ( that would be fun ) I would also make more frequent updates because the last update was like 3 months ago and you said in the description that you would do your updates weekly and the last two things I want you guys to make is make your cities bigger or make new ones because New York is the size of a tiny town. Last thing is I wish you could respond to the people who are inside your car so anyway that is it Good Bye! "

There is a little too much grinding in the game as you're leveling up your planes, but it's a pleasant enough gameplay experience and hasn't lost me yet. Dig the graphics and challenge... Reminds me a bit of Jamestown, except without the volume of content.Controls are a bit driftier than the controls many iOS shooter fans have come to love in Cave's games, but they still feel good (they don't feel laggy or slow, like the iOS version of Raiden).Overall, I hope the debs continue to develop this game. It has great potential and is totally worth the $1 asking price.UPDATE:Just beat the final boss and not a single crash. Assuming those experience crashes are on older devices.Anyway, I seriously hope new content is released eventually. I'd totally pay for some new levels & planes. Pretty burnt out on the three included worlds after all the grind that was required to upgrade my planes (and I didn't even max them out).Again, this is a solid shooter and I've really come to like the controls and play mechanics. Well done. It's a fun,  entertaining game for the price..  The only problem I have with it is,  after every mission restarts you must get all of your power ups,  weapons over again..  A bit annoying,  other than this,  great game to pass the time.. It looks like it is good game, but some of the graphics is not that high res.   It has a tendancy to crash repeatedly -- It did for me 4 times before the first game, and 3 times trying to play the second level.   It looks like a 1942 clone -- but they use the collecting of crosses to unlock things -- which you can also buy if you don't want to do it the hard way.   An all to common method of paying for free games.  Not sure it works here until the stability issue is handled.  The crashes add frustrasion that overwhelms the nostalgic shooter fun that was intended. "

When you drive the plane near the mountains, the enemy planes have more difficult to shoot you. With the command, keep moving to avoid enemy fire.  When driving a bomber and they are peppering the spitfire, keep focus on your target to bomb, because the mission is completed if your target is destroyed, even if your bomber drops a few seconds later.

As you breed new furry friends and add them to your orchestra, you can see how their unique melodies affect the overall sound. Meanwhile, caring for your crew by gathering resources and crafting unique items provides a satisfying challenge.  This game is a great sequel, well prequel to the first adding new features Like Wondermine and Celestials. To me it was fun teleporting monsters to the Adult islands. But it had one flaw, the food system, the food system well let‚Äôs just put it, was very tedious and annoying, it personally ruined the game for me and I still played MSM 1 way more. The only things I really did was get celestials and teleport monsters to the space and Party Islands (easiest islands) and at a point I just gave up because the content became lacking and there wasn‚Äôt a new update in a long time. I still played MSM 1 though because of the new magical                    Islands but then there came update 2.0 a total revamp and fix to the game. And this update made me get hooked right back in, now you can collect money from your monsters on the continent which is a godsend because the main way to get money as a beginner was feeding your monsters and doing quests, which wasn‚Äôt sustainable. Now we can feed our monsters which whatever food we want which makes it easier to teleport them to the Adult Islands. And the Prismatics are awesome too, I love the Idea of them, giving us way more content, now I play this game more than MSM 1, so all I have to say is, thank you to the Monster handlers. You made this game 10 times better. I have both SM Games, for now I‚Äôll review DAWN OF FIRE!      I like this game a bit more than SM2.... I can choose what to grow,  Who to feed, how many gems I‚Äôm willing to spend...(more on this later...) I guess I like to see what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôve sold stuff on the market, bought stuff, too. Somehow I feel closer to this game than the other....     You need to have MORE INFO. Available! Just by estreme chance, I discovered that At a the next level up, I can grow cane...but WHERE do I use it? So I am constantly PROWLING around my islands..I now have the ICE CAVE ISLAND...to discover clues. I don‚Äôt know if that was intended, But, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happen‚Äô.....     One thing I do not like is how expensive all the monsters and structures are... I was able to buy the basic monsters and I now can level THEM up (to move to the party island...sending them at lvl 5 does NOT yield a lot of rewards like coins.....so I‚Äôm selling them (37 coins ) andI plan on sending higher lvl monsters.  I am a retired person and $$$$ is scarce after paying bills, so Imust rack my brain to play. Maybe this is good, time will tell. I was informed that I could collect ‚Äòice shards‚Äô from my ice island...I haven‚Äôt SEEN ONE....NONE. AND removing trees and rocks should ALWAYS be rewarded....I‚Äôm playing on a fine line right now....more info please? "

Also, what‚Äôs a VIP track?I would like to add, I was building my house and I had a bridge and a creek kind of south where I was building. I built a huge water slide. After I completed my kitchen, I went outside and saw that the bridge and creek were gone and I only saw a pond and colored staircase made of blocks, not stairs as I used. I chose the largest world (2048x2048) so I should be able to build (2048x2048) but instead it seems like I can go up to 130x450. FIX IT NOW AND ASAP PLEASE!

I would lie to see a LEGIT police simulator from you guys. One where you can both drive, walk around, request backup, do traffic stops. All those other police games are trash. They are either missing one or all of these features. At first I thought this was gonna be one of those cheap fire truck games where all you do is drive and park. One hit to anything is game over. But no! It was completely not what I expected. New: Well I have come with suggestions now! Make it so you can have the lights, but no siren. Maybe a separate button or press the siren button twice. Make it so you can get out of the truck and go inside buildings on fire. If there are hurt people, you can call an ambulance and if the fire is too big, make it so you can call backup and more firetrucks and firefighters will arrive.  EVEN NEWER: Add the traffic advisor light bar (the yellow one that count move in a way to tell traffic what lane(s) they should move towards) The looping Q2B siren is just annoying and gets VERY old really soon. Thank God for the ability to have the lights flash without the siren! The lighting pattern is just old and I don‚Äôt like it! Have a modern lighting pattern one that‚Äôs quick and just random not one that just goes reeeedddd bluuuuuee reeedddd bluuuuuueee cause that‚Äôs VERY boring to look at how about something like red-red-red-blue-blue-blue-blue or red-blue-red-blue and have it go QUICK like 1 millisecond between each light not 5 seconds. Have a siren selection where you can choose between about 3-6 sirens and add a Q2B siren button that, when held, builds the sound up and when let go it drops the sound down just like in real life! Add an actual fire truck horn not a car horn because it‚Äôs useless and why even have it? And add more light bar options for the different types of trucks and different sirens for the different trucks for other countries. Add an option to get out of the truck and go in the station and be able to wash your truck for free when you do it yourself and fuel it too. Add a thing where the station is big and has different vehicles you can choose from and get in and then unlock different countries with different trucks kinda like Notruf 112. This game has SO much potential. This game is great, I love the concept of the game. I love fighting this fires and driving a customized fire truck. One thing I‚Äôm not a fan of is the Car AI, You should make it so the AI moves off to the side of the road when your sirens are on. It‚Äôs gets tiring when your trying to get to a fire put just slam into a car because they don‚Äôt get out the way. One more thing I‚Äôd like to share is that I was going to an Apartment Fire once and I was gonna put out the fire but there was a bush and a wall on the ground that were a couple feet away from me but there was a barrier there so I had to go all the way around the big barrier to get the fire. And the barrier prevented me from being able to put out one fire, I had to extinguish it from a specific angle. Other than these few thing, I really love this game. Just what I was looking for! "

All who say the graphics aren't great, this is a port of a 1992 game that NO Apple computer could have run at the time!  There are a couple bugs I see on my 3GS.  After changing settings, the game runs slow and stops being smooth-- you have to quit and re-run.  And if you turn off music, there are many sound effects you seem to miss.  Other than those, it's almost perfect.  Only things I'd like to see is a setting for the number of balls you get and for it to remember which table you played last by showing that ""icon"" when starting the app.  Stones and Bones and the circus tables are the only two I like.  Thanks for bringing back the memories! This is so unbelievable!!!!! After all these years this is still one of the best pinball simulators ever!

The levels are challenging but there isn‚Äôt a huge variety of them. Most of the levels have a relatively similar set up. One thing I do want to point out is the constant advertisements.

Tip: to stop ads put on airplane mode and turn off your wifiüòâ I do wish there was more costumes to buy because I am on level 115 and I have all the costumes.

However the game does have one detail about it that bothers me (no it‚Äôs not that half of the Dino‚Äôs should have feathers) it‚Äôs the scale. While you did a grand job on most of the scaling some of the dinosaurs either feel a bit too big (I.e velociraptor) or way too small (I.e Allosaurus). And granted I haven‚Äôt hunted them in a while (especially allosaurus) and you may have fixed the dinosaurs sizes it still really bothers me. Oh and before I‚Äôm done with this essay of a review I‚Äôd like to say one little thing... the spino and rex feel a few feet shorter than usual.And that‚Äôs it really, hope you guys see this and cya! (I should probably check myself right about now) Hey hunter! Thanks for gaming with us and for your suggestions! Don't forget to share your ideas in the comments under the Facebook note https://www.facebook.com/notes/carnivores/suggestions-at-carnivores-dinosaur-hunter-hd/2037873802930357/, so we will never lose it! I‚Äôve been playing Dinosaur Hunter for practically half of my life now‚Äî And I enjoy the idea of it quite well. However, I agree that this game should meet more standards; And be updated more often since it is the only mobile app from the Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter series. Being true that Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn has been a bigger work in progress, including the fact that its graphics are very well improved apart from this mobile version, and Reborn acquires more hunting perks; I feel like it‚Äôs although fair to switch your eyes to this app often, updating it regularly every 2-3 months. Okay‚Äî First things first‚Äî The recent reskinning on some of the dinosaurs, I have to point out that it made me upset. The other skins that came with the certain dinosaurs when they were released in the game were more original; But now it feels like the reskins gave them the common colors that varied through every dinosaur in the game. It‚Äôs not only that, but there SHOULD be more dinosaurs, more diverse wether they‚Äôre soaring in the sky or lurking in the ocean‚Äôs depths. Also, the graphics are fairly good‚Äî But can be improved with smoothing and extra key details. I‚Äôm not saying that you have to turn this completely into Reborn, but give this mobile game more thought. With more work, I believe this game is only a couple steps away from #1. First off I get why this game is 5 dollars but for 5 dollars you have to meet people expectations. When I bought this I expected a hunt but it was just a lock and load shoot Dino‚Äôs and leave. Add a better detection system. I believe you just added a radius that is the detection zone but I think you did it all around rather than on the peripherals. Maybe add a food and thirst bar that you fill up by eating mochops and dimetrodons. Make the Dino‚Äôs harder to find but still manageable. Herbivores also defend themselves so maybe you should make them dangerous from tail whips to headbutts. Increase each dinosaur size by 2.5x so it feels more realistic. I get that this is a alien planet but the proportions will seem the same next to the dinosaurs. Also make the guns better! Instead of just having the gun in your back pocket why not have it holstered in your hand. Lastly the best feature you can probably add is Dino‚Äôs that kill and eat each other for food! If a carnivore sees a herbivore it will attack and kill. Which ever one is the heaviest will win the fight. Also add pack hunting for velociraptor. Make the allosaurus look like a allosaurus. Also make it so carnivores fight for meals. And make flying bird hunts. "

The glitches are ridiculous. They end up hitting at a horrible time and it ends up costing you ridiculous amounts of resources to repair the damage done, that means you have to pay medals.  The worst of all the glitches is when using the aegis (aka a bubble of protection). You set a 24 hour aegis and in less Han 24 hours you are getting hit and zeroed. Complaints to the developers go unanswered. The MODs can only do so much and you never know who they are on your Battle Field. They are more concerned with making medals then having a fair and balanced ww2 war games. They are constantly doing inter server battles and pairing very weak battle fields with ridiculously powerful ones. This forces conquerors to spend ridiculous amounts of medals to even conqueror. The ww2 war games is no longer simulator games....I would rather conqueror Angry birds. To me, this ww2 war games is a scam and borderline fraudulent with how the developers change things to force people to spend medals or quit and loose out on the medals that was invested.When you do make complaints about glitches they expect you to have a screen shot of the glitch. It takes them on average over 10 Z days to respond and it‚Äôs always the same generic reply. They merge battlefields in deliberate ways to force the conquerors to either quit or keep spending medals. From the beginning of the ww2 war games they give you a chance to build up and survive amongst the other conquerors by early on unlocking a piggy bank allowing you to keep resources if you are attacked. Now let me say now at a level 23 command that bank doesn‚Äôt do much but in the first few Z days that helped me keep my drive on building and gathering resources. What pushes me now is my great corps that I‚Äôm apart of they help protect me and others on the battlefield and help keep peace and order during the week but on the weekend expect pure chaos. Be prepared to put a shield and wait to the weekend is over to gather resources outside of corps gathering plot or else certain death may come to your troops. With all the things that have changed and happened with this ww2 war games over the year or so I‚Äôve conquerored it I give it 4 stars it‚Äôs fun and frustrating at times but what‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen is you lose your army and resources oh and don‚Äôt forget the flames you have to look at if you get attacked to but other than that this is a long term fun strategy ww2 war games I love and recommend to my friends all the time. Occasionally there are bugs but I report it to the devs right away and they usually take care of them in a Z day or so. I‚Äôm happy to conqueror this ww2 war games all the time and will continue.

And I absolutely love your games. But I have several suggestions for the tiger game. You should add quests like in the Wolf game you made. There should also be more skins to unlock. Such as, the Maltese tiger, Siberian tiger, shadow tiger( A beautiful gray tiger with white stripes that costs 6000 gems) the fire tiger, the frost tiger, and the poison tiger. In the wolf game and in this game, you should be allowed to start a clan. To start a clan, you need 500 gems to unlock it. Whoever starts the clan, is the leader, and is the only person that can add people to the clan. If you make clans, then you should add cvc ( clan vs. clan) a little like pvp  but only clan members can join each side. It intensifies the game and doesn‚Äôt count individual people‚Äôs points. It takes team work. I hope you enjoyed my ideas! ( first of all, I love this game, love it, love it, love it. ) I have an idea - the dog or the cat. || THE DOG - Skins : The skins in it are different dog breeds. You can choose what dog to start as, each has their own tactical perks which doesn‚Äôt require points ( ex: a corgi would have lower strength but could dodge larger animal‚Äôs attacks more. ) You can choose what dog to auto start as, and the others are automatically unlocked. Some examples - German Shepherd, Husky, Doberman, Labrador, Golden Retriever, GrayHound, Saluki, St Bernard, etc. || MAPS - The starter map is a forest, the second is a human neighborhood ( you can‚Äôt kill humans, but you can attack other things. ) A mountain area, and an abandoned laboratory area. ( same for PVP Maps ) || THE CAT - Skins : You start as an orange tabby, and then you get a brown tabby, and then a black cat, then a cream colored cat, then a tuxedo cat, and the special ones are - winged cat ( no flying, just wings ) and the VIP is - a robo cat. || MAPS - First is a huge meadow with mountains, then a winter forest, then a Island MAP, then a beach. |||| It would make my YEAR if you looked into this! |||| ( first of all, I love this game, love it, love it, love it. ) I have an idea - the dog or the cat. || THE DOG - Skins : The skins in it are different dog breeds.

After a few days of having it, the conclusion of my character‚Äôs life glitches out and doesn‚Äôt leave an ending message. It gets into a walk loop and keeps going backwards. The game is mostly stable. The review section was awfully disappointing because many don‚Äôt get the concept of the game, but I‚Äôm happy I decided to download the game despite the reviews. In a summary, the game is awesome if you actually get the concept of it, since the reviews can be terribly misleading. there aren‚Äôt particularly issues but the point is that there isn‚Äôt enough realism put into the game. 1) I‚Äôm sure there are a lot of females playing this game and wanting to be able to change their character into a female.2) maybe add a little more ethnicity into the game! like instead of having tan or caucasian characters, and africans, native americans, asians, and many more ethnics.3) there is options like the ‚Äúblind‚Äù person one? yeah it‚Äôs very nice but it barely happens. i recommend adding more stuff like that, possibly mental/physical issues.

Yeah, just about everyone I play is Indian but why is that an issue?? lol. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm playing any bots. I just don‚Äôt understand what everyone is complaining about.  Annoying. This has quickly become one of my all time favorites. I even moved the app on my phone to my fave games screen. (Think of it as like how MySpace back in the day has the air Top 8. Lol) The gameplay is fun but ONLY if you‚Äôre actually playing against a real person, 9 out of 10 times you‚Äôre playing against a bot which almost always win. And of the real people that you play against they are all Indian. This is of course not in and of its self a problem but in a modern world like today with 7 BILLION people, is that the only country you can connect to??? It makes no sense. Also, the betting system makes as much sense as a 3 dollar bill. The increments don‚Äôt make any sense and the fact that there‚Äôs always a few thousand that just disappear from the total is ridiculous. In addition, the silver and gold chests are just terrible. Even in a gold you MIGHT get 10 blue gems when you can sometimes get half that in a bronze gym. You should be getting AT LEAST triple that in a gold chests. Also, the gold that you can win is barely anymore than compared to a bronze chest and you‚Äôre pretty much guaranteed to get repeat pucks and strikers almost each time. I played this game for over a month hoping updates would fix it but they never did. It‚Äôs trash don‚Äôt waste your time Okay I like the game, it‚Äôs fun and it‚Äôs a good way to waste some time. However it‚Äôs got two fundamental issues. For starters when playing offline, the only option is practice mode, where you have to play against yourself? This is really annoying, because the board doesn‚Äôt flip and you have to turn your phone upside down. Like Why don‚Äôt you include the choice to play against a bot instead? Secondly, when you are playing online in the tournaments or whatever, there isn‚Äôt any way to make sure that the other players actually play. Too many times it‚Äôs happened that my opponents just don‚Äôt do anything for their turn until I either win the game or I leave. This is really unfair because if I leave the game the other player automatically wins. There should be an option to report other players for not actually participating. If you could fix these then I would totally enjoy the game way more. Thanks. "

Maybe also upgradable radios with better features, tires, electric motors, shocks, Etc. start the game with access to at LEAST two cars.

I don‚Äôt want to keep buying the game. I don‚Äôt want to play cards. I don‚Äôt want to continuously upgrade my car. I don‚Äôt want to be restricted on how long I can drive.  It‚Äôs fine if you offer additional cars for a price, but let me decide if and when I want to do that. Also, for you users out there: When you read reviews, don‚Äôt just read them in the default order. Click ‚ÄúSee all‚Äù and sort by ‚ÄúMost recent first‚Äù.  Nearly every time you do that, the first (newest) review will be a one-star and say ‚ÄúThis game was good, but after the last update...‚Äù Thank you for the honest feedback! Would it be better with the options showcase more subtle? As for the driving without the time restriction, check out the Sandbox mode: there you can explore all the game's features without the timed goal.  This is the second time I‚Äôve downloaded this game hoping it was going to work unlike last time but no it‚Äôs still the same being AFK and telling me that it‚Äôs not capable working with my device when I have an IPhone 6 Plus but just like last time it says the same thing. The only reason I rate it four stars is because how fun it looks to play but it got me having second thoughts about if this game really deserves those four stars cause what‚Äôs the point of giving it to you when I can‚Äôt even playüòîP.S. my last download was a year ago, so much for fixing it like it saidüò°üòî‚òπÔ∏èüòï "

Took a chance on it and haven‚Äôt been able to stop yet. The physics are terrific and gameplay is challenging but with a little practice it‚Äôs a load of fun.The only critique I would have is make the controls just a little more visible. Other than that I cannot wait until an update that has more missions! Good job!UPDATE: Picking up the extra astronauts in order to get 3 stars on many of the levels is proving to be close to impossible. Just finding them is frustrating and uses a great amount of fuel. They also run away from you when you go to pick them up (why they would do that I have no idea). Might want to make it just a little easier for us simpletons to accomplish. This is the same Dev that makes Ships of Glory and Nuclear Fighter Bomber (check those out if you haven‚Äôt yet). I‚Äôve had NFB on Android since a long, long time ago. I had no idea that he made all of these. I can just get his games sight-unseen and pretty much know it‚Äôll be decent. Everything this guy makes is fun.This is no exception.  I like lunar lander-type games, and this is in that genre, with more of a plot.  Pretty cool.One request if it‚Äôs at all possible: for some reason, I got used to playing landers with the left button firing the left thruster and vice versa. Sort of like I‚Äôm ‚Äòpushing off‚Äô. The first thing I have to do is usually reverse the defaults in lander games.An option to reverse the left/right thrusters would be great.That said, another fun game. üëçüèªAdded: nvm, found how to flip the controls!

One thing I think that could bring in more revenue into the game is to add a new feature in which candidates can build their own headquarters around the states and to hire staffers by the state (for example giving 300,000 dollars to North Carolina to buy 5,000 staffers to run the campaign in that state). Another feature that you should add is Presidential Debates in which you are asked questions and your approval and polling numbers go up, and then also Vice Presidential Debates in which you take the position of your Vice President to answer questions to better your campaign. A final feature you should add is computer vs computer so you can watch an election unfold before you and keep up to date on the things each candidate does. The game is overall not laggy and fun to play. Designers and creators deserve more credit than given.Spencer Rada I love this game and it is very fun. I do wish there was more advanced stuff like debates which is one of the best parts of the campaign trail. I assume there will be future updates that adds things like debates. I also wish there was some way to unlock the payable candidates without buying them. There also were some important candidates that were left out like Andrew Yang and Cory Booker. Overall a great game though, and I can‚Äôt stop playing. I really enjoy this game. I have it on both mobile and the PC. The mobile version is also good, but I think some more features should be added. The main thing I would like to see added is the ability to give speeches in a state. Right now, stamina is entirely useless on mobile since you don‚Äôt control where the candidates go and that speeches aren‚Äôt in the game. Adding speeches would give stamina a real purpose and would offer another way of campaigning in a state besides advertising, ideology, and operatives. It would also make the mobile version feel more like the PC version. Anyway, thanks for reading this review. Hopefully speeches are added in the next update. Have a good day! "

It would be great if more houses are available right away. And what you see on the ad is not what the actual game is. In the ad it shows somebody putting the thing on One by one. But in reality the game is you clicking a button 10,000 times to finish your house. And I have know idea how to unlock the other houses. It would be great if we had a little bit more creative freedom too. I like this game. But once you upgrade it so many times. You can finish your house in like a half hour to an hour because you‚Äôre just making money while using your money. And I can‚Äôt figure out the time thing. Is it one day or one hour I can‚Äôt tell. And because I don‚Äôt know how to unlock the other houses. I‚Äôm just making a bunch of money in an app that I can‚Äôt really use anymore. I don‚Äôt know if they have more houses or if they‚Äôre still trying to make new ones. But now I have to keep the app and it‚Äôs gonna keep using my space or delete it and then when they come out with more houses have to re-download it because I do really like the app. And it might not save my progress and money I already have so that I have to start completely over. Also there‚Äôs way too many ads without you even clicking on something to have to watch an ad and then you get no reward for it and then you can‚Äôt use your pig things that you got for the money that you had to watch an ad for anyway! I LOVE this game. I‚Äôve been playing it t for like 4 hours straight now, and I‚Äôve really enjoyed it. Now there is one thing I‚Äôd like to criticize. Besides there only being 3 houses. Now I know a bunch of people are going to yell at me, but let‚Äôs take a journey to real life for a minute. In real life, does it cost $100k to paint a 2x27 inch area with undercoat? I do not think so. What im trying to say here is that the more money you spend on one specific thing, like wall undercoat, the more expensive it gets. And every time that amount of money added to the current cost of the thing, increases. I‚Äôm very sure that‚Äôs not how real-life economic physics works. But like I said, overall, this is a great game. It took me well over 2 weeks to finish the three houses they have in the game, at first I would spend around 10-30 mins in the app but then I upgrades got so expensive I couldn‚Äôt make the money of the upgrades in 10 mins or more so I invested on the offline stuff which I have 2,730% offline income and almost 4 days max of offline time that gets me around 10B but that‚Äôs hardly enough for those last upgrades the last week I spent upgrading the house were just me going into the app once a day claiming my offline income getting upgrades and then letting the app rest till the next day the max you can make a second is around 310 k and some upgrades are 800B so just imagine best tactic is to upgrade offline time and income and go in once a day upgrading and leaving.

The story is also wholly worth it... it's a bit unconventional by most otome game standards, but rather unique and engaging. Honestly, I was a bit iffy on the art (sometimes the characters come off looking a bit derpy to me) at first but the storyline sealed the deal for me and after a while, the art didn't bother me as much as it did when I was playing the Lite version. However, this isn't your typical fluff so if you're looking for a lot of lovey-dovey type actions and such, you probably won't get much out of it.The length of this game is pretty average at seven chapters (plus the epilogues), given that the story continues with the other characters. I won't bother to go into the storyline, but I liked the approach to the story and the options you're given throughout. The options given were actually much more challenging for me than most other otome games so I really liked that aspect. If you choose the best answers you'll receive an epilogue after every chapter you achieve an ""S"" rank, which is vital if you're looking for the romance in all this! I am looking forward for the other character routes and to see how the plot progresses. :) Okay, I'll be honest; after I played through the game once, I set it down and forgot about it for three months.Today, I found it again in the very back of all my iPhone's pages of apps. I remembered how the game had appealed to me the first time, so I clicked it and started playing from the very beginning, the prologue.Oh boy. Sucked into the storyline immediately, I read and read until I was finished. I enjoyed the fairly hard choices to make each stage-- they were much harder than most otome game's choices. Akio was utterly adorable, and may I mention that his voice acting was perfect? His adult version was sexy and his child version was adorable. The voices were great.I will admit I was a bit taken back by the artwork sometimes. There were many occasions where the characters just looked plain weird. Still, the characters and plotline are well worth it. I found myself less bothered by the art by the fifth chapter than I could have imagined.Excellent story. Can't wait for the new ones. I was really disappointed with this visual novel. In my opinion, the story was somewhat flat and predictable, though it had its funny moments. For example, the carrot incident, which is immediately cut off by the game over. Speaking of which, the game gives you little to no freedom and forces you to take on the role of a character you know nothing about and guess what they're into. Sure, these choices are made fairly obvious by adhering to some humble hero standard, but doesn't that just make it less exciting?  And if you make the wrong choice, you are sent to the beginning of the stage (which makes sense since you are in a game, but is still annoying as crap). Also, the art was actually painful to look at. There were few instances where I saw any of the characters as attractive, and it was really only the princess.I had my doubts about this VN to begin with, but seeing all the praise it was receiving as well as  it being one of the few visual novels in the app store, I decided to buy it. After playing the VNs ""Scar of the Doll"" and ""Moe Cure Net"" for both a dollar each, I may have had high expectations from more expensive novels. ""Kira*Kira"" and ""Tears 9, 10"" were able to satisfy, but this just didn't seem well worth the price to me. Sorry.3/5 Would not recommend.(I tried to format this review for easy reading.) "

The sounds are so real, and it is a great way to release your stress, there is one thing I would change like  I said it barely has any ads but if anything was to change it would be no ads but there only two more thing maybe have an entire car, and a shop you can go in and but thing. That would be great! but I would most defiantly recommend this game! The game is really satisfying at first, but the game eventually adds obstacles. Therefore, you can‚Äôt finish crushing the object your trying to crush without dying and having to restart. This got on my nerve SO much to the point I have to close my eyes when I go through the obstacles so the objects not being fully crushed don‚Äôt annoy me. There also aren‚Äôt many levels or environments. I got through all 10 environments on the first day of having the app. This is also the third day I have had the app and I have already unlocked all the tires. AND I have unlocked all of the things you can crush. Not going to lie, I‚Äôm probably going to delete the app in a few days because honestly, it gets REALLY boring after a while. Another issue I would like to add is that there are WAY TO MANY ADS! They randomly pop up when your trying to play the game. Also, if you want to unlock just about any tire you have to watch an ad. So first of all, in the ad is where I found out about this game. In the ad it showed like a wheel I don‚Äôt, smashing stuff on the ground and I got it because I thought it was going to be like listening to the sounds and asmr. Then, when I got it was really disappointing because there was only a car and driving like what I means is no crushing or anything. But I am going to give this game a chance so, I am going to play it for a few more days and if I like I will keep it, and if I don‚Äôt I will delete it.P.S ( I saw the reviews before I got this game and they were talking about the ads and they were right the ads are just to much.

‚ÄéYume Nikki,"A masterpiece remained in the history of RPG Tool ""„ÇÜ„ÇÅ„Å´„Å£„Åç"".

Although this app plays well on my iPhone it does not look as great or run as well on the iPad. On the iPhone it performs flawlessly and feels very similar to the original classic except for a few menu and sound bugs. But for $2.99 this mobile port is a must grab for any huge Yume Nikki fan. To bad there is no controller support. Maybe that could be implemented in a future update? After reading the reviews, I had serious doubts about buying this app. But because I absolutely love this game so much, I decided to bite the bullet and I bought the app. First thing I noticed that that it was half the speed of the original. Many reviews say this, but I quickly discovered that you just have to turn off low power mode to have it run at normal speed. It is just like the original but with some inaccurate names for the effects, but other than that, I would say this is really worth it if you like Yume Nikki. But, there is only one problem. You can‚Äôt rotate the screen. It is always with the charger pointing to the right side of the phone, and even if you rotate the phone, nothing changes. But it‚Äôs not even that big of a problem, it‚Äôs only an issue if you are charging your phone and it creates an awkward angle.Overall, great app, and the other reviews are making it seem really bad, which it‚Äôs not. I like it a lot. First of all, I never bother with reviews, but Yume Nikki is a game so near and dear to my heart that I can‚Äôt stand seeing it done so dirty. First of all, the price point. If I‚Äôm going to /pay/ for a game that‚Äôs free on PC, it better be good. Especially more than a dollar. A huge issue in the game is the framerate. Going up/down staircases easily takes double the time it would normally, and the bike effect and speed glitch do little to help that. It takes an excessive amount of time. The controls aren‚Äôt intuitive, but I understand porting a game like this onto a device with no keyboard is difficult.Another technical issue is the fact that the music clips almost constantly, making some areas a pain to be in with sound on.There‚Äôs also a nitpick with the changing of some names. Medamaude and yuki onna have been changed to ‚Äúeye palm‚Äù and ‚Äúsnow woman,‚Äù which makes it hard for a die hard fan to locate in the menu.I‚Äôm excited to have a version I can take anywhere, but there are too many flaws right now for me to be able to excuse having to pay three dollars for an otherwise free game.

There are some glitches with the distance of the home runs and sometimes the pitches are frustrating but I understand that they want it to be challenging. Also they should add more things to do with your coins like maybe being able to spend them on gear cards not just players I have so many and I‚Äôm waiting for something to use them on also add another source besides daily challenges and derby‚Äôs and the mlb buck balls to get mlb bucks because after a while of grinding on derby it gets boring. And 1 more thing the packs you get from series points you should be able to tap them and see what you could get from them like all the other packs other than that this game is vary fun and you should play it. I‚Äôve played about 30 hours of this game which shows I enjoy it. However I‚Äôm leaving this review to rant about the issues that will soon have me quitting. Very frustrating issue in some fields where homeruns hit signs or billboards (example being progressive field) and for some reason don‚Äôt count as homeruns resulting in frequent multiplayer losses.. Offline derby‚Äôs are far too easy making them quickly become boring. Online tournament has also not been loading for hours at a time recently so I can‚Äôt participate. My biggest issue is that I‚Äôm currently using a player that has a total of 125 power and 108 contact with equipment but can literally NEVER outdistance an opponent in multiplayer. Whether they‚Äôre using a rare player epic player or legendary. In fact my max homerun distance with said character is around 720ft and that is only when I can pull the pitch down the left field foul line making it descend further when sailing out of the park.. Hard to believe someone using a rare or epic player should be able to consistently hit deeper homers than a legendary player with 125 power. The reason this game is great is simple: IT‚ÄôS FUN!  It‚Äôs a blast to hit monster homeruns and this game delivers.  The hitting interface is so great, I wish they‚Äôd bring it the the R.B.I Baseball app as well.  My biggest gripe is that the game is positively infested with ads that you absolutely must watch to earn more of the virtual currency required to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù equipment upgrades that would allow you to really compete.  Wish there was another way to make that happen without all the ads.  Truth is, I‚Äôm not even watching them.  I play the ad to double my rewards, skip a challenge, etc. but then I set my iPad aside for a few minutes to do something else when it plays, then come back to collect my rewards when the ad is done playing. Advertisers aren‚Äôt getting much value from that, and more importantly, it makes for a poor gaming experience. Update: there a new bug that freezes the game after a multi-player game. You must force quit the app.  Then the game inexplicable selects Bryce Harper to replace any player you had previously equipped as your player, when the game restarts. Why is he coded as the default?? Super weird. "

What would make it more fun? More variety! Also I feel upset because I have this massive farm with a ton of land but I can‚Äôt receive any help from the harvest sprites like I could in the other game?!? What‚Äôs the use in befriending them then?I think if you could do an update where the harvest sprites could help care for the farm that would be great. Also I love my husband but lol it‚Äôs so boring having one. It‚Äôs not even like I can uphold a random convo with a villager so that‚Äôs odd. Also the fact that I can‚Äôt build more coops or barns is extremely frustrating.Anyways, so those are my main two complaints: help from harvest sprites and bigger coops and barns... I started playing this game about a week ago and loved it. I think it's a great app version format wise. I think a lot of people put too high of an expectation for it to be a replica of the console games but that's not what it is and I think the developers to great designing according to the convenience of an app and it is so fun with all the same features of the console versions in app form. The sad part for me is that not all of the glitches have been fixed and I really hope they are soon because I love the app version and want to continue playing but will have to delete it if I can't play it. I've read other people experiencing different types of glitches as well but for me I am stuck on the loading glitch which won't allow me to get past fall 23 year 1. I go to sleep but it just stays on the black screen with the circle spinning in the middle. I tried saving then sleeping, waiting until 5:00am in the game when the harvest sprite forces you to go to sleep, and exiting all apps and rebooting my phone as CeeCee has told others online but still nothing. Please fix this Natsume I love your games and want to keep playing. I‚Äôve been in love with the Harvest Moon games since I was a kid and honestly, this is seriously disappointing. What‚Äôs the point in having to switch to farming mode just to pull weeds and then back into talking mode to pick up my chickens? It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm planning on using my hammer on my chickens or talking to the weeds. I also would like to point out that I gained 4,075 gold pieces from selling my harvest, and when I saved and went back into the game later on, I only had 2,045 gold pieces. Maybe a toggle button in the bottom corner is easier for moving your character than whatever is being used now because I am constantly getting stuck. WHY DONT THE HARVEST SPRITES DO ANYTHING????????????????? I was already upset that there were only three but now I‚Äôm upset because my character constantly faints from over exhaustion because there is so much to do and not enough energy. I‚Äôm seriously so upset I paid $4.99 for this app when Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp was free and absolutely a better reboot than this app. Please please please, I‚Äôm begging you. Fix this. "

There's really only one bad thing about it, and that's a less-than-optimal user interface. You cannot reorganize bakery equipment (say, to group your ovens together) without selling and rebuying equipment. Apart from that minor irritation, though, a worthy game for would-be bakers. Lengthy review but my honest opinion...I, like everyone else probably, tried the demo version first to see if it was worth buying the full version. And wouldn‚Äôt you know, it was addicting enough to think the full version was worth it! So I said, cool, I got $3 to spare, I guess. (Side note: I‚Äôm not so big on game apps so, for me, it‚Äôs a huge deal when I find one I actually like.) so yeah...clearly this game WAS worthy of a five star rating until...-1 star: it only goes up to 30 levels. And that‚Äôs easy to reach, really. Truth be told, because of this quarantine life, I got there in less than a day. So imagine my disappointment when it said I‚Äôd hit the max level. Whomp whomp. Unless the creators decide in the future that they‚Äôll offer more levels in an update, this game is NOT worth spending money on.-1 star: it makes you think you need to buy (on the game, not real purchases) all the different recipes like the popsicles, pretzels, and ice cream. But hey hey...guess what...I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve only sold one or two ice cream cones  , zero pretzels, and zero popsicles in thirty levels. -1 star: cost of the actual app should be $0.99 if you‚Äôre gonna charge people for a limited level game. Sounds stupid, but three dollars is too expensive for what you‚Äôre given when you basically get the same quality as the demo.Just save y‚Äôalls $3 and stick with the demo. That way you won‚Äôt be in my dilemma:I wanna delete the app but I paid for it so no. I love this game! Baking cakes and pies in between helping customers, pricing your products, stocking your kitchen, using your oven space wisely, trying to keep up during the busy times, and organizing and cleaning your shelves when it's slow, this game has so many elements of a real bakery! Please buy it and give it a try. It costs less than your lunch, but will give you hours of entertainment. "

Now he remembers his past he's an angel that was sent to make me happy! I was so happy l love this game please make a 2nd one! The coco thing is not what I expected it to be I wait 7 hours for those to come and the option to get them should be when u have 0+ and the holding space of coco should be more than 5 coco so please make the storage of coco bigger and better. I thought u could talk to the tiny child nope u don't and we should be able to customize the child's eyes and clothes, please put that in and work on the game customization and other things but the bugs being fixed bruh it's fine no bugs!! I was searching my App Store and found this game it looked adorable and said you could interact with the little boy I thought this would be the best game ever the best I've ever played but no it's not this isn't even a game all you do is wait 50 minutes for chocolate bars? and tap around the screen with flowers or other stuff like that it's honestly really boring and I just would like if you could interact with the boy it's an adorable concept a great style to it but it says you can interact with the boy and you just can't this literally would be the best game ever if you can just interact with him fully like there's a little bubble above his head that says he's hungry/sleepy/ect. Or just be able to play games with the boy or be able to talk into the phone and he answers back through something like that it's adorable I will admit that but the layout is just flat out boring. And can I even named him? I can't choose what clothes to put on him or what color hair eyes he should have or even our storyline I can't do anything but tap the screen feed him chocolate what kind of pastime is this it's horrible just some mini games or. Any games you could possibly play with the boy or choose the clothes or stuff like that there's just no interaction is says in the description that you can but obviously you can't. I'm thinking about deleting the game so fix it up quick before nobody wants to get it anymore try your best -Safire PLZ!!!! Well it‚Äôs good and cute but.. u have to use REAL LIFE MONEY to GET DIAPERS? Just whyyyy. And for some reason the Watch button, which is for getting chocolate bars for the baby demon, it won‚Äôt work for me, I keep pressing it but it won‚Äôt show me an ad to get some chocolate, and we have to wait for like, idk but 53 minutes!? Why can‚Äôt it be ten minutes? Also the baby demon is cute but it‚Äôs so small, it‚Äôs the size of a toy tbh, but for me I feel like it takes a while to make the baby demon grow up, and I also have some ideas for the game! One, we should be able to name the baby, bc we don‚Äôt what to call it but a baby demon. And we should decorate the house, it‚Äôs so plain, just saying tho. And can we get coins to just buy diapers with the coins? Anyway the game is good but there are a lot of problems and good ideas that should be added to the game, the game is kinda like idle games, and their is nothing else to do basically, just accept my ideas, and I hope some of the updates will add some ideas Like naming the baby, and I‚Äôm sorry that this is so long, their are so many problems and I hate it, also my mom is kinda poor right now, so there should be a sale to get the diapers, like one penny, but I guess u won‚Äôt cuz u guys want to suffer, if u do that, now I‚Äôm going, bye bye! üòí "

Right off the bat all the cars are uncompetitive and I don‚Äôt think anyone has the time for a virtual career like this game offers. I think the developers could package this a little differently and make some compromises to speed up the play.  Ditch the dual currencies and the timers - get more people to playEdit: Thanks for clarifying the payouts. I‚Äôm not trying to be cheap, I‚Äôd just rather buy the game and maybe have IAP for paint skins or something. It‚Äôs a fun game, I highly recommend it. (- Make the sprint cars faster and controller support would be great) Thanks for the feedback. Players can race any car in Quick Race and World DTR multiplayer, even those they do not own. To advance in career mode, it's best to upgrade cars and use mechanics to help repair them.  World DTR mode is an excellent way to earn coins to accelerate this. We also doubled World DTR payouts in a recent update and increased sponsor bonuses in the career mode. We will continue to improve the game and hope to earn a better rating from you soon.  Thanks again for your comments! I‚Äôve been looking for a replacement to the dirt racing mobile 3d game that just crashes on new iPhones. So far this is a decent replacement. Kudos to the developer for all the different adjustments you can make to the car, they really alter the handling of the car. You can tell a lot of effort went into making an accurate portrayal of dirt racing. The handling is as good as you can get in an app. I‚Äôm not a fan of the damage tho, it doesn‚Äôt take long to get to a point where I‚Äôm so slow because of the damage that I can‚Äôt earn enough money to fix the damage and fixing it free takes a long time. I‚Äôd rather watch some adds and get it fixed instantly. Also don‚Äôt like how the low line is always the fastest. Would be nice to be able to run the top and make some passes. Also seems like it will take forever to progress through the game to finally get the sprint car, which is what we all want from the start. I thought you could rent them for the quick races, but it doesn‚Äôt work for me. Also don‚Äôt like how no matter what gear ratio you run, the car tops out almost instantly after the turn. Definitely a work in progress, but happy to see a developer put this much effort into a dirt track game. I hope they have enough success to keep making the game better! Thanks for the detailed review. We are continually making improvements and your feedback is appreciated. We would like to know more about the issue you had borrowing a car in Quick Race. We invite you to contact us at info@ScreamingGames.com Honestly not bad for a dirt track experience. I really dislike the way that the low line is always the fastest and the way the AI races is awful. First off with the AI if you get side by side with them they will drive you to the top of the track for no reason. Second when an AI becomes lap traffic they race you just as hard as they would on the lead lap which ruins a lot of the racing. On another note way to hard to get to another class in career mode races are way to long just another attempt of sucking peoples money which is fine and dandy but at least let us get to the stock car class no one likes racing the dinky 4 cylinder.  On the positive I will say the physics are almost all the way there. Plus the games crashes a lot I run an I phone xs max but the game crashes on the same lap same race 3/4 times I tried to race it. I don‚Äôt know much about development I‚Äôm sure this game was not easy to create but props to the developers for creating a dirt racing game that‚Äôs almost perfect just a few tweaks would make it more tolerable.

Carry on! :DHey, I wrote a review saying I loved the first one and can‚Äôt wait for the 2nd one to be released on mobile, well I got a App Store gift card as a present, and saw this the same day, talk about a good day huh? Anyway, so glad I bought it! I love it, like the new mov mechanics, I also like the customization settings as well, I know team 17 enough to know new prison are soon to come so I‚Äôm not worried about that, what I am worried about is that after the Feb 13 update for the iPhone X bug fix the iPad Air 1 keeps crashing when I open a prison, I mean any prison, new prison, saved prison, old prison, I even tried deleting and reinstalling, tried another Game Center account, cant even play the tutorial!! I wrote a review on your direct website, that same day, it is now the 26th and you have yet to respond, I‚Äôm not mad, i just want to raise awareness to this issue, who knows maybe it happens to other iPads and iPhones, I‚Äôve read reviews of constant crashing as well, such a good game with more to come, I would hate it if it had to be abandoned because of an annoying crash bug. -A Loyal Fan ok so yeah,you add a second escapists and everyone buys it,(you following me?), so when they get more money, they seem to develop more parts of the game. which makes people happy like me cus i like the train map dont judge me üò¨. which when theres good development means freezing and crashing ü•∂,which I‚Äôm not judging you for, of course i love it just a few suggestions.1:so you know the guards are bots well thats also kind of stupid (no offense) but you could add a guard mode for multiplayer mode.2:PLEASE fix my PROGRESS LOSS its so annoying i spend 2ingame days getting 100 strength and i quit on accident and gone.3:just fix the crashing and freezing because i love this game and i dint want glitches taking it down. this is me when you read my reviewü§†. this is me when you dontüò≠. Look, this game is much better than the previous one in multiple ways, from the graphics to the animation to being able to earn money by doing jobs and missions. However, I‚Äôve already lost my progress. TWICE. I was very close to escaping a prison when the battery indicator on my iPad showed up. I figured that since this game uses auto save, I didn‚Äôt need to worry about it as long as I exited from the game by hitting ‚ÄòQuit‚Äô, which I did. I come back later to find all my progress reset apart from having completed the tutorial. This happened again later on. This is the only significant issue I‚Äôve found with The Escapists 2, so as long as you‚Äôre willing to risk having all your progress reset, it should be pretty fun. "
‚ÄéArtemis Spaceship Bridge Simulator,"Report to the Bridge! Artemis is a multi-player, multi-device networked game for IOS devices.  IT IS NOT A SINGLE-PLAYER GAME; IT'S FOR FRIENDS IN THE SAME ROOM TOGETHER. Artemis simulates a spaceship bridge by networking several computing devices together. One device runs the simulation and the ""main screen"", while the others serve as workstations for the normal jobs a bridge officer might do, like Helm, Communication, Engineering, and Weapon Control. Artemis is a social game where several players are together in one room (""bridge"") , and while they all work together, one player plays the Captain, a person who sits in the middle, doesn't have a workstation, and tells everyone what to do.",https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple20/v4/ee/79/62/ee7962a4-02d8-301f-16e5-dafab16b407b/mzl.hvwwybgd.png/1200x630wa.png,,3.2 ‚Ä¢ 31 Ratings,$2.99,,"June 1, 2016","Pretty amazing party game. If you want to experience what it's like to be on a starship bridge, this is it.  I recommend looking online on how to run this game online or a local area network. Port Forwarding isn't the most user-friendly thing for playing with friends. There's some great tutorials to get it all hooked up though.  This app seriously needs an update though and will crash if the server version doesn't match. 5 stars when updated. The iOS version is incompatible and will crash if you try and run it with the latest version of the PC server.From everything available, there appears to be no effort to update this app to work with later releases.Other than that, if you are running just iOS or cripple your Artemis server back to 2.4, it works as advertised. But it‚Äôs kinda like having a car with a transmission that never leaves second gear. It runs, but do you really want to take it on a long trip? "

You could add a flintlock pistol and all the different rifles that were used during that time, a grenade that the Grenadiers used would be cool.  You‚Äôve made machine guns and a flamethrower, why not a Gatling gun and a cannon? I understand that this may be hard to do, but many people would appreciate this, especially history buffs like me. The first four apps are amazing! Keep up the great work. Great graphic and the gun operating is awesome, just like the real thing. Best gun simulator app ever! Totally worth the money! Just one more improvement to make, can you make it so that we can duel with our friends using the guns through Bluetooth or wifi? That is a good idea I think, and will probably make the app better I love everything that the game has, especially since you guys used the real reload for the Colt 1873. I just think that the Colt 1873's reload could be easier since there is a certain part on the gun that you must touch, and a Weaphones game is not complete with such a short amount of guns. It's less guns than Weaphones: Pack 1 Free! And just look at the full versions of Pack 1, Pack 2, and the WWII pack. "

It can have more though. Here are  my ideas for more simulators: Ultimate Reptile Sim (iguanas, Komodo dragons, snakes, salamanders, etc.) Ultimate Fire Sim (It's where you get to be different Fire creatures like phoenix, Chinese dragon, Fire Crab, etc.) Same thing but with Earth, Wind, and Water. Wind: Wind Spirit, a smoky serpent-like creature. Wind Dragon, a dragon with feathered white wings on the end of its tail. The Wind Dragon's colors would be purple, gold, and white. Earth: Burrowing Dragons (the name says it all) They would dig underground palaces, caverns, etc. Grounders, small black, green, and brown creatures that create tunnels. Water: Water Dragons, dragons  with blue, purple, aquamarine, or sky blue fins on their tails. Fleepers, small, bright creatures that are like flying fish but instead in shades silver, bronze, blue, and purple.

Haven‚Äôt been very crazy about most match 3 games.   Thought I would give this one a try. Actually pretty fun. Haven‚Äôt gotten stuck on any levels (YET) Have giving several ways to pick up extra bombs and other items for extra help.  Makes game more enjoyable.   I don‚Äôt like getting stuck on a level for hours or days trying to get to next level.  So far this hasn‚Äôt even been a problem.   I have been having fun with this one.    Enjoy I agree with so much with what other people say. The graphics are very pretty. The fact that you have to play the same level over and over again gets very discouraging. I like a challenge but not to the point where it takes you two days to move on. Five lives go very quickly. Unlike some people I cannot afford to buy anything to help me move on. As someone else said, I watch the ads to get the extra help, but never do seem to get it. Also, you should have a page in the help section showing what the hammer, scuba tanks, anchor, etc. do as mine just sit there as I have no clue as to how to use them. I do like this game quite well, but definitely needs several improvements to keep people happy and playing it as one of their regulars. Hope you make some updates and I will be one that stays and recommends your game.You need to be able to get the purple diamonds easier so that you can have more of them to help you move forward. It is absolutely ridiculous to be stuck on one game for 2‚Äì3 days at a time. A game is meant to be challenging not discouraging. I have made my own team, but have lost several of them in just a matter of days. Is your goal making your people happy playing the game or making yourselves happy by just trying to make money? I‚Äôm not that crazy about match 3 games but I thought this one looked pretty and I liked the aquarium theme so I decided to try it.  I love it! It‚Äôs beautiful and it‚Äôs challenging. I think it‚Äôs a lot of fun to play! Looking forward to all the new scenes I‚Äôll be adding to. I‚Äôm already fairly addicted. lol "

I love the use of the models from Unity Assets. The hair style collection is nice as well. I do have a few recommendations. The club leaders don‚Äôt do much. They just stand there and you can‚Äôt do much other than kill them or join their club. Maybe create more classrooms so that they can have classes and be programmed as normal students? Also, their outfits are kind of odd. Just make them wear the same school uniforms as everyone else! I like the addition of the clerks and store managers, but they don‚Äôt really do much either, just stand there. Maybe give them something to do? And maybe get students to visit the stores and stuff during lunch ours and after school. The students themselves are very robot like, only moving to class and lunch. While you can interact with them, it‚Äôs very minimal. Maybe have them interact with each other? This goes for teachers too. I am happy that teachers are now more active, as they didn‚Äôt do much at all before. Add student lunches, and maybe a seat for the player. And give the students activity! They really don‚Äôt do anything while in club hours, just stand there. Also, I think I speak for most players when I say that we need a house, since we could start in the house rather in front of the school. And maybe give other students and teachers homes as well instead of having them spawn outside a very large tunnel. I‚Äôm happy with the improvements this game has gotten. Keep up the good work! Ok the school isn‚Äôt really interesting all the classes are the same and in clubs you can‚Äôt do anything but it‚Äôs swimming you swim -.-  I wish the school had just something anything on the walls it‚Äôs more like a prison than a school it places. The bathrooms are just quickly put together there aren‚Äôt even doors or a sink it‚Äôs not really  decorated it‚Äôs just some bricks and a toilet I wish there were goals like kill this person or somthing. I don‚Äôt know what yen is used for other than buying drinks     Also they students are so robotic they go from class to class it‚Äôs almost creepy how they ALL walk or run in unison with 100 kids it‚Äôs just unsettling to me at least. The principal doesn‚Äôt do anything you can say hi or bye but that‚Äôs all besides killing him. Same with the club leaders they stand there you can join there club but that‚Äôs really it. I wish you could costomisethe students as you can yourself and the guy you can change there outfits but that‚Äôs it.           I wish there was somthing more to do other than kill people that‚Äôs it there no goals or anything. GOALS NEED TO BE A THING or multiplayer or something it‚Äôs boring you don‚Äôt do anything if u kill somebody they don‚Äôt respon so u run out of people really quickly aswell I am a HUGE anime fan. As much as I love this game, I don't get the vibe that I get from watching other people play the ACTUAL thing. Ik that you can't do EXACTLY everything in that game, but you could add a basement and you should be able to decrease a captive victims sanity. The way you can do this is drug them, then store them in a box. It would also be cool to ACTUALLY interact with the A.I. Like you can compliment them, or do random task for them! You should also make a popularity meter, to show how popular you are. You should also lay out weapons at the school, like outside. I'm using a IPhone 5c, and idk if it's the game, or my phone type, but I would appreciate it if you would add the weapons at the front of the school. I would also like to play ""Cupid"" for other people. You should also add a rival, like a rival that will compete with you for senpai. Like he/she would hang around senpai and talk to him, you will have to either ""Play Cupid"", Kill Her, Drown Her, Or you can drug a person and decrease their sanity and make them kill the rival. Other than this, I LOVE this game! It's AWESOME! And I hope you continue the updates!-Your Biggest Fan "

The visuals are great, the sound is nice, the animals look really good, and the game is not too much of a finantial burden (Just don't let your kids go wild with your credit card.  Use passwords.)  The only downsides I can find are that some of the perfect shots are nearly impossible to achieve (flying squirrels, kingfishers, orcas, dolphins, please fix that Black Market Games), and all the achievements are impossible to get.  This game is fun if you are stuck in transit, need a quick break from the hussle and bussle of daily life, or just want to have a good time.  This game is developed by the same minds behind Pony Friends 1 and 2 (if you have a DS or a 3DS I reccomend them.)  So I found this to be quite enjoyable.  The horse breeds have different stats, and there are different abilities from the equipment you earn on the way.  The paywall is always a problem, but at least it's only optional.  Get this game and enjoy it. Hello Black Market Games,    I love this game! It‚Äôs so much fun. I love that you can care for your pony. I definitely appreciate the sweat scraper because I have only seen it in this game and I do have to do that to my horse. I think maybe you could add being able to feed and give water to your horse, and maybe groom it with brushes.     Another thing that is great is the riding. I love that you can truly ride your horse (in the game of course) and take photos of the animals. I quite like that you can go on different trails. It‚Äôs really neat. There are a few things you could do to make it better, though. One of the only things that I don‚Äôt like is the gallop time. I wish you could gallop longer; it‚Äôs really annoying. Another thing that I don‚Äôt mind but would make the game better and more realistic is to add trotting and cantering. It‚Äôs not a huge deal but it would make the game better and more realistic.    Another thing about riding is that maybe you should be able to ride dressage or jump or barrel race or whatever. Maybe compete, too. This  would make the game more entertaining, I think, but the game is great right now anyway.    All in all, this is an absolutely amazing game. There are a fe things that could‚Äôve improved but it‚Äôs a great game. You should definitely download it. I look for games where I can ride my horse in first person and care for it and all that but I found it ü§ó. I have been playing Pony trails for 6 years not straight and it‚Äôs so much fun! I really enjoy riding a horse taking pictures of animals on trails and caring and customizing my horse. I have been playing this since I was 5 and I still love it! Many fun years! I certainly recommend this game to any horse lovers! What you do: You are a riding photographer who photographs wild animals. You collect as many photos as possible and it rates how good your picture looks. You can care and upgrade your horse. There are so many different trails to go on and sooooo many different paths on each trail! And so many paths on paths!  You must care for your horse by hoof picking it washing it with a hose. You can pick and change your tack by collecting so many different types by collecting coins from trails and getting them from in game gifts! Go on trails and ride your horse taking pictures of wild animals and collect as many coins as possible and those coins you can use for tack, horses, gear, and more! Make a huge album of pictures in the games picture album! Over all an awesome game I really recommend! Thanks for reading! "

I also thing that for a future update, you should add an upgrade shop that only uses the Space Science Coins go buy stuff, but those upgrades are expensive and really really good for the player, kinda like the more advanced version of the gem upgrades shop. Overall, really fun and interesting game! This is game is great, but it almost an exact copy of another game called Egg Inc. Sure there are a few things changed up here and there, but if you compare the games you can see how similar they are. I guess nowadays a game can be as similar as another as long as it has a few visual differences and difference concept (ex: Eggs or Astronauts). I doubt this game was made by the the creators of Egg Inc. but it‚Äôs ridiculously similar. I don‚Äôt really care that it is similar, but I don‚Äôt understand the point of ‚Äústealing‚Äù another game and changing it a bit to make it your own. I guess from a business point it‚Äôs a good idea, but I‚Äôm not a businessman. Anyway I still love the game because it is based on the game I love and spend hours of my life on. I just wish we could create new games that are worthy of spending hours of time on. No hard feelings to the creators. Like I said I still enjoy the game. Hello there! Thank you for taking time and giving us such a feedback. Our developers are working on new features. If you have further suggestions please don't hesitate to contact us through support@veloxia.co. We are a team detailedly valuing customer responses, so actually are willing to improve the game according to the feedbacks received. Downloaded the game before the most recent update, the new achievement system feels like it isn‚Äôt finished as well as very unrewarding. I have completed 2-3 achievement trees and haven‚Äôt completed the others because they don‚Äôt register my completion. The concept is great but it feels incomplete, the same thing with the daily‚Äôs. Removing the the free reboot per planet was something I disliked but is understandable for as revenue so I can‚Äôt complain about it. Overall a very enjoyable game with my only complaints being the revamped achievement system, hope this can be addressed in a future update. Would like to see more buildings and vehicles as I‚Äôm not even to the end game planets and still have maxed or close to maxing vehicles and buildings. Hello! Thank you for this amazing review!

Civilization Revolution 2 carries the franchise‚Äôs winning formula to iPhone and iPad, expanding on its predecessor with a new arsenal of troops, technologies, and characters. Complex tactics and gorgeous 3D design make each match a pleasure as players expand their empire, make allies, and declare war using famous leaders ranging from Napoleon to JFK. I really enjoy Sid Meier's Civilization games, and I am a big fan. I did not find this game to be nearly as ""buggy"" or poorly made as I have read. However, it is also far from being perfect. The biggest issue I had was with the first game I started. I played it through almost to the end, but I learned the hard way the importance of saving the game. I left the game idle twice while preparing a meal and both times the iPad went blank and upon unlocking it again, the game had to reload completely but I was happy to see a ""continue game"" option. The first time I pushed ""continue game"" it worked fine. The second time failed 10 times before I gave up. I kept getting stuck forever on the loading screen. I was almost to the end of the game and it got me pretty discouraged. I miss options like ""hold for one turn."" I have to move the armies fully or push the ""defend position"" button. I constantly forget what I have on the board because I have to put so many armies in the defense mode. I also battle with lag and long loading times. It is still fun though. It does work, is playable, has most features of the other versions, and is fun. I am generous with my 4 star rating but if this gets updated again and fixed, it will be an easy 5 star. I didn't upgrade from the earlier version of iPad Civ for a long time because reviews led me to believe it wasn't worth the cost. I agree that the upgrade isn't drastically different but it has enough cool bell and whistles to make it worthwhile.The new leaders are nice even if Kennedy seems brain damaged. There are new military units, wonders and technologies. The Deity level seems harder on this version. My biggest gripe is the lack of a wait function on the units which the earlier version had. For military units, this means you HAVE to fortify to remain in place which makes them inactive on the next turn. If you want to pocket a great person for later use, now you have to run them around in circles each turn.Bottom line, the game is nearly glitch free, has better graphics, and a number of new additions. It still doesn't have the full features of the PC version but I wish I'd upgraded to this version sooner. Definitely worth the money. "

I wanted to download it again, but there were so many bugs stopping me from enjoying it, 1. After I would watch a ad before a fight, it would show me the mckdickie screen and I couldn‚Äôt do anything, I would have to reload my game. And when I reloaded my game, it happened a few more times. 2. It didn‚Äôt save my progress, I fought two fights, and when I came back, I had to re fight those people. 3. Whenever I press random results a.k.a picking who wins randomly, it ALWAYS picks the other person, it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I reload my game and try again it‚Äôs always the other person winning. 4. It didn‚Äôt let me add any points to make my character better, I couldn‚Äôt even add 5 points to make my grappling, speed, etc better. It upseted me because I would lose because I have grappling, speed, etc of 60 percent. 5. When I put it on average, it was easier than when I put it on ‚Äúvery easy‚Äù, I first put it on ‚Äúvery easy‚Äù cause I‚Äôm not very good at the game, and very easy was SO HARD. And then I changed it to average, only for it to be easier. Please fix that, I gave it 3 stars,  because those were the only bugs, and I know tho game has potential. And every game it‚Äôs the same bs. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they‚Äôre  fun when the games actually works properly. But then you get thrown into a submission hold (or any type of hold really) and you‚Äôre just stuck there. Then you furiously tap every button a million times because there is no form of ‚Äúcountering‚Äù. You‚Äôre there until the AI gets bored and lets you go. Wrestling revolution has it, Extra lives has it, The You testament has it, weekend warriors has it, Hard Times has it, Superhero city has it. Literally every single game has this bs in it. Why is it so hard for you to add in a way to fight out of these holds? It‚Äôs not based on skill, or timing, or anything else we have control over. It‚Äôs based on pure luck. ‚ÄúWhen will this AI let go of me so I can continue to play the game‚Äù is how it is most of the time. But then if *I* try to hold someone down and punch them in the face, or have them on the ground, they counter and escape immediately. Deep down, I really do love all of these games, but I also hate them because of the garbage like I stated. I hope to see it fixed one day but I‚Äôm 99.9% sure it will not be. This game is a great game for a indie game and I have played this on other devices but for some reason on iPhone it has this bug that when you get adrenaline and you use it it doesn‚Äôt make you do any move it freezes your opponent for the rest of the match until you simulate the match and it has never happened for any other device but for some reason it does it on iPhone and I hate that they haven‚Äôt noticed this bug English, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Malay, Norwegian Bokm√•l, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Traditional Chinese, Turkish, Vietnamese "

Also there is a bug with the other wolves in your pack involving their tail? Also I like the personality think but I think you should add a stay button on your pack for like wolf pups. I think your pack should always follow you and stay near and not wonder off and get stuck glitching in the map you also need to fix the interactions on the zoom in and and zoom out that kinda stuff and maybe make the lakes have rocks underneath and maybe some tiny creek plants. Also I recommend you make a ultimate hyena sim 2 and dog because the last dog one you made was not to be rude pretty bad. I also think when you have pups that when the grow up their wolf pup fur changes into one of a random choice in the coat colors that would be cool. Also with the person my wolf is always gloating so maybe make some different personality and feelings and stories on how the wolves meet instead of the same thing and make it to where you can choose one wolf to be your mate so you can keep the bond you made with that wolf and maybe family relationships like brother, sister stuff like that please read this and maybe think about my recommendations please thank you I really love that game. Overall, this game is a very good one! However, there are many bugs. It is understandable that there are going to be bugs in a newer game, but some of them are too large and too obvious to be looked over and affects the overall game. The boss battles in this game are several elemental spirits. So far, I have beat the earth and water spirit. But every time I come to the fire spirit, glitches occur. In the beginning i would get very close to killing the boss, I would turn and run back to heal a little, turn back and the boss starts over. I was still in complete range of the boos battle, and I was in the range of the bosses fire, but apparently not enough for the battle to continue after five seconds of wait? I continued to fight the boss, but each time I was about a quarter of the way from killing the fire spirit, the game reset. I would give the game benefit of the doubt and say it‚Äôs incompatible with my device, but I‚Äôve tried it on several devices now and it does not change. Another glitch occurs after battles with smaller animals. After killing them, I am stuck on the camera setting that only is supposed to exist when a fight occurs. I tried turning on and off locked camera, going to a den, everything. The only way it works is if I leave the game and go back, but then I end up losing some of my game data? Again, this is a really fun game, but the glitches are VERY annoying. I had 3 pack mates. Crobel, my main character, Eroa, and then Hades, the son of Crobel and Eroa. He‚Äôs a puppy. I was switching back and forth between the three playing as them all when suddenly Eroa went missing. I went and tapped on her icon, and she fell from the sky onto a totally different part of the map. So, I opened the map and tapped on a den to teleport there, but instead, she died(?), and her icon was replaced with Hades. There were TWO Hades?? I refreshed multiple times, but I can no longer play as Eroa. I can see Eroa and interact with her, but I can‚Äôt play as her. There aren‚Äôt two physical Hades, but there are two icons of Hades, one replacing where Eroa should be. I tap on both and they take me to Hades, and sometimes it replaces the duplicate Hades with a duplicate Crobel. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to play as Eroa. I‚Äôm scared to delete one of the Hades because I don‚Äôt know if that will delete Eroa or if it will delete Hades, so I don‚Äôt want to do that. Please try and fix this. I‚Äôve been noticing a lot that whenever I tap on a den icon, the wolf dies and switches to another one, but this is the first time anything like this has happened alongside it. "

Overall the game is fun just like the desktop version I play on my Mac. It is nice though to be able to play it on my phone. You will eventually get stuck if you play this on your iPhone 5s. I played the same level four times and it will not let me advance. Works fine on the 4s I really like this game. It's probably the best farm game I've ever played. My only suggestion would be to add another upgrade to the well that'll make the grass grow by itself. That would save so much time & give us one less thing to worry about once we get to the higher levels. This game is pretty addictive, I paid for the first 2  and they stopped saving my progress hopefully that bug is fixed with this version. Only bad thing so far, I played the lite version first, and my progress didn't transfer. "

But once I beat the last infection and realized there was no reward for grinding through all the infections. It‚Äôd be cool at that point to get cheaper upgrades, 2x speed, unlock the ability to use all 7 evolutions (only as an award for grinding through all the infections) maybe even a research lab to be able and go into a match with an pre upraded Transmission, symptom, or resistance. Just some cool ideas to keep the game going and rewarding for the player, also it would keep us on your servers longer ü§ò thanks for making the best free version of this game possible though, I still super liked its five stars from me. Great game. It‚Äôs a fun time waster and I never spent a penny on anything. No need too... although I think to infect all of Europe in less than 130 days I need to pay for something, but no thanks I‚Äôve done everything else. If you play and claim you still have people let at the end try making sure the world is 100% infected before doing the symptoms. Why did I give it a 4-star instead of a 5-star?  Well I think it would be better like others have said if you did a player v player and who can win first or who can come up with a cure and save the planet from the other person. Some of the vectors like birds show that they really don‚Äôt help when you look at the bars for infection and stuff so what are they really for if they don‚Äôt help infect. The last thing would be fun if it had more detail and you could pick cities to start things in and make it a game that could drill down to a city level and not just big city level. Maybe one where you are bad trying to hit different cities or countries while keeping yours safe. I just got this game today and it is super fun!!! It takes a little while to get to win a game but once you get the hang of it it is really fun!!! But on the downside to the game, the first screen you go to has a problem with scrolling, and the app purchases could use some help to. My friend was playing this game and he had an iPhone 8 so when he accidentally hit an in app purchase it scanned his fingerprint onto the phone and then he got 30 extra DNA points while WASTING 99 Cents. Also one more thing I like this game because the thought of blood and death doesn't bother me as much as it does to some other people, but I don't recommend it to like 4 to 5 year olds because they might get scared any that thought and I don't want anybody to be scared!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇThanks for reading my review, and have fun playing!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÄüòÄüòÄü§í "

The only thing is that there are often a bunch of grammatical errors or certain parts that could use better wording, so you could really benefit from having a competent editor to make the stories even better. Then, there‚Äôs the whole issue with the hearts. I feel like a lot of the premium choices that cost hearts are too much. For instance, I chose a premium option that cost about 25 hearts (or something along those lines) when it should‚Äôve cost only 15 because the scene was so short. Most of the time it‚Äôs not even worth it, and I get disappointed about having spent my hard-earned hearts on such short scenes. I wish I could spend more hearts to read the premium scenes, but I want it to be worth my while.Also, the reward system (the daily rewards and the romantic quests) makes it hard and slow to earn hearts. I know that it‚Äôs a free game, and you have to earn money by getting people to buy tickets and hearts, but you should at least be reasonable. With Choices and Episode, you can earn diamonds and gems after each chapter you read. In Choices, you also get the option to watch ads to earn more diamonds. In Episode, the app has challenges where you can read whatever story you want, so you can earn more tickets and gems if you play consistently. So I rated the app 3 stars because I like the stories, but it would be better if the premium choices cost less or if the reward system changed. I've had this app for a few months now and I've explored the stories enough to really have a feel for all of them. I've played other apps like this one, but this one is by far the best! The stories are amazing and intense, with rarely a dull moment. I like all the MCs and they're even relatable. I love the art, but I do have to say that some of them can look a bit goofy at times. I've seen a lot of people complain about the tickets, but I don't see any issues with it. I've played games that have me wait 2+ hours for a ticket only for 3 minutes of readable content, whereas in this app the episodes are long and always have something to offer. I'm not a fast reader, more because I like to take my time, but it usually takes me about 10-15 to read each episode (like I said, some people may read faster than me). I'm okay with only getting two tickets because if I could I would spend hours reading the stories, since they are so good, but I've got life to move through. I do wish that it was easier to get hearts or that they would be less expensive, but they need to get the money somehow and I'm happy to contribute.Either way, I definitely recommend this app and my favorite storyline is Love & Legends (Saerys being my favorite and Reiner close behind <3)!

‚Äé60 Parsecs!,"Atomic Space Age was a blast! Until it became the Post-Apocalyptic Space Age. Your space station is about to explode and you only have 60 seconds before things get messy. What (or who) will you grab before you make a mad dash for the emergency shuttle and begin your journey into THE GREAT UNKNOWN? This is 60 Parsecs!, a dark comedy sci-fi adventure set in the Atomic Space Age - complete with all the Cold War paranoia, chrome-plated wall accents and cockroaches with space helmets. Lead a crew of woefully unprepared astronauts, equipped with whatever junk - sorry - ""supplies"" you can grab before blasting off, on a journey across the cosmos that's best described as misguided. Make the best of it, while dealing with soup shortages and other horrors of outer space. Will you have what it takes to find a new home and survive? Bon voyage! SCAVENGE & EVACUATE With only 60 seconds before nukes reduce the space station to floating particles in the vacuum of space, frantically grab whatever supplies and crew you can before getting out of there. You never know when that sock puppet will come in handy. SURVIVE & DECIDE Space funerals are inconvenient, so try to avoid dying where possible. Use your limited supplies and (hopefully not limited) wits to make difficult choices and ensure your survival, even though the odds are definitely stacked against you. EXPLORE & CRAFT Duct tape fixes all problems, but how do you fix (or at least craft) duct tape? Chart expeditions to find resources, craft survival essentials and explore strange new worlds in a procedural, very-much-permadeath adventure. LEAD & PROTECT As captain, it's your duty to keep the crew happy - they're less likely to kill you that way. Manage relationships as you watch them grow closer and hopefully not throw each other out the airlock.",https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple114/v4/43/2e/9e/432e9ed3-884e-5187-3d95-6f593934ae14/AppIcon-1x_U007emarketing-0-9-0-85-220.png/1200x630wa.png,,4.5 ‚Ä¢ 58 Ratings,$3.99,#58 in Adventure,"September 4, 2020","I‚Äôve played both 60 Seconds & 60 Parsecs, and I‚Äôd have to say that 60 Parsecs is the superior title.1. The CharactersIn 60 Seconds, the family doesn‚Äôt have much personality. They have names and appearances, but nothing unique about them! In 60 Parsecs, each crew member as a special personality and different strengths and weaknesses, as well as more defining physical features. 2. The Story60 Seconds has you stay in a shelter due to a nuclear bomb to wait until you are rescued. 60 Parsecs has you launch into space inside a shuttle as Earth is bombed into destruction, and you must find somewhere to live. 60 Parsecs clearly wins in this category. 3. The Gameplay60 Parsecs updates the original formula with a crafting system, additional areas to travel, more characters and more! 60 Seconds main things to do are go on expeditions, make a choice, and ration. 60 Parsecs expands on the initial design and increases its quality.In conclusion, 60 Parsecs is a considerable step up from 60 Seconds (a game I enjoyed). I think this game is great and anyone who liked 60 Seconds with love 60 Parsecs. It‚Äôs really good as most of the other reviews have said but there‚Äôs is this one part I think is a bug. On the stormy planet, if the old alien alien guy comes to ask for power no matter what you say, yes or no it will always say you had to decline. I hope this gets fixed so I can get an ending at that point! Game was really good except that it didn‚Äôt record any progress in the Records Section, I built lots of stuff but the records were all Zeros‚Äôs and showed none of the progress I had made, I was able to save a video to my photo album but when I clicked to save my adventure to Facebook after finishing, the game crashed and when I loaded it to try again it wouldn‚Äôt let me because the game save was gone and would only let me start a new game.I hope you fix this because when you make progress in a game it should show up in the game.This game could use a patch or two to fix those issues.And maybe a way to store more than one game save.

The cars do not do that they just keep turning the same way which, realistically at least, limits the car to basically sliding around. However, this is not one of those games that takes foever to unlock stuff. I got a total number in drift points of about 664,000 on my second try while getting about 22,000 coins. the chepast car is 70,000 and the most expensive is 2,000,000. idk if there are coins mutipliers or whatever because i just started to play this game but if not than the last car would take far too long to get. But seeing about how many trift trials i did for the amount i got in comparison to the cost of the cars, i would aume there is a multiplier of some kind to get more coins. There is a video thing you can whatch five times a day to get a total of +50,000 coins a day though so there's that. But you also have to pay coins to unlock more tracks though. The game is decent the cars slide a little too much and it makes it hard to chain drifts or if you're on the bonus map its extremely difficult to go anywhere. I hope the dev can see this and fix the wall tap mechanic i tend to push myself and get close to the walls but i lose my score before i even touch the wall and most of the time i don't its super annoying when I'm going for high scores and coins when I'm doin great next thing i know Ive lost all my points and have to restart "
‚ÄéAdvanced Space Flight,"Advanced Space Flight is a realistic space simulator for interplanetary and interstellar travel. It is the only space simulator available that takes into account relativistic effects during interstellar flight. Besides simulating space flight this app can also be used as a planetarium, with all known planets shown in real scale with their accurate keplerian orbits. It can also be used as a star chart and exoplanet explorer, showing all solar systems with confirmed exoplanets within 50 light years from the Sun. This is the only app where you can get a sense of the true scale of the Universe, zooming out throught thousands of galaxies and galaxy clusters until you see the entire observable universe in your screen. Locations: - All Solar System planets plus 5 dwarf planets and 27 moons - All confirmed exoplanetary solar systems within 50 light years from the Sun, making a total of over 100+ exoplanets. - Over 50+ stars, including main sequence stars like the Sun, red dwarfs like TRAPPIST-1, white dwarfs like Sirius B, brown dwarfs like 54 Piscium B, etc. - Experience the full scale of the Universe: you can zoom out from a few meters to billions of light years, until you see the entire observable universe in your screen. Flight Modes: - Realistic Flight: Travel using optimized trajectories, calculated based on the orbital parameters of the origin and destination planets to minimize fuel usage. These are the kind of trajectories that would be used in a real space mission. - Free Flight: Take manual control of a spaceship in space, activating the engines as you see fit to achieve your goals. Spaceships: Advanced Space Flight features several spacecraft, based on present and future technology: - Space Shuttle (Chemical Rocket): Designed in 1968-1972 by NASA and North American Rockwell. It has been in service from 1981 to 2011, making it the most successful reusable spacecraft ever built. - Falcon Heavy (Chemical Rocket): Designed and manufactured by SpaceX, made its first flight in 2018. - Nuclear Ferry (Nuclear Thermal Rocket): Designed in 1964 by Ling-Temco-Vought Inc. - Lewis Ion Rocket (Ion Drive): Designed in a 1965 study by the Lewis Research Center. - Projecy Orion (Nuclear Pulse Propulsion): Designed in 1957-1961 by General Atomics. Some early prototypes were built before the project was abandoned after 1963. - Project Daedalus (Fusion Rocket): Designed in 1973-1978 by the British Interplanetary Society. - Antimatter Startship (Antimatter Rocket): First proposed in the early 1950s, the concept was further studied after advances in antimatter physics in the 80s and 90s. - Bussard Ramjet (Fusion Ramjet): First proposed in 1960 by Robert W. Bussard, design was improved in 1989 by Robert Zubrin and Dana Andrews. - IXS Enterprise (Alcubierre Warp Drive): Based on a concept design fom NASA designed in 2008 and popularized in 2015, it was the first serious attempt to design a superluminal spacecraft. Artificial Satellites: Several human-made satellites are present in the app: - Sputnik 1 - Hubble Space Telecope - Internation Space Station - Kepler Space Observatory - Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) - James Webb Space Telescope Effects: - Atmospheric light scattering effects, making atmospheres look realistic both from space and from the surface of planets. - Planetary clouds that move at different speed than the surface. - Clouds in tidal-locked planets form giant hurricanes, caused by the Coriolis force. - Stars with volumetric corona and lens flares. Star color determined by surface temperature. - Planetary rings with realistic light scattering and real-time shadows from the planet. - Realtivistic effects when travelling close to the speed of light: time dilation, length contraction and relativistic doppler effect.

It‚Äôs been a learning process for me. One thing I would really like to see is a method to track which objectives have been met in Campaign Mode. Along with this, a way to find launch windows to the objectives that still need to be met. At first, I became very frustrated with trying to get from Earth to any other planet in our Solar System. The method used for one Planet did not work for any other planet. I am very confident in saying that the Space Shuttle can not carry enough fuel to take it beyond the Earths Moon, let alone to Pluto or  Mercury.  As I looked into the physics needed to travel beyond our Moon, this App seems to have left out a great deal of detailed information and calculations needed for such a journey. I also noted that the Planets in our Solar System are not in their correct positions. The correct planetary positions would be the easiest to program in an App. I am led to believe the Developer of this App has taken a great deal of liberties with facts and figures when making this App.  I regret purchasing this App. I love this game, it‚Äôs so peaceful to launch a ship from a planet in to orbit or to another planet, and to just lay in bed at the end of the night and watch it until you fall asleep, and then to see the progress when you wake up in the morning. Only one thing I‚Äôd love to add. More galaxies to Go to and more planets to explore, I don‚Äôt care if you have to go through a loading screen to access it if you click on it.

But it crashes and freezes quite a bit! Also I wish there was new obsticals you can do when you upgrade the obstical course. Finally I know yall need money but I wish you could use coins to unlock the rest of the dogs. Even if you do like a special event where you can use in game coins to buy the other dogs that would be awesome! With the thought of events there should be events that happen like add missions to complete every day and you get coins and experience points. Like I said before I love the game I am at level 20 now and still gonna continue to play! These are just a few issues that I have noticed along the way! Update: I finally got to level 36 and bought everything! But now it's done leveling up so now you just take care of dogs and it's quite boring that you have nothing else to do other than gain money. Very boring please please add more stuff!!!!! Add things like ""oh no your bath tub over flooded! You have to fix it and pay 500 coins"" or ""oh no one of your dogs escaped last night! You won't get any money from this dog!"" Stuff like that would be more fun and interesting. That and I've noticed a few glitches and crashes but those are just simple things that can be fixed. I love this game it‚Äôs very fun I just have a few comments and suggestions: 1. Obstacle courses are quite boring after a while, I think you should add more obstacles. 2. Most of the decent dog breeds cost money, I wish we could either buy them with real money right away OR get to a certain level and then buy them with in game money. 3. The garden gets kind of boring, maybe add a playground?? 4. I‚Äôd like the game to have more decorations also once you‚Äôre a certain level you can‚Äôt upgrade anything anymore, so maybe add more high level upgrades?? Other than that, great game, keep creating!! I also wish there were mixed breeds or something, mixed breeds are just as good as purebreeds! Also, I kind of wish people could bring in sick dogs and you have basic medicine to treat them with, like in CatHotel. Those are my suggestions, I hope you think about them!! I love Dog Hotel!! It‚Äôs the best, so addicting! And so I do agree that you should get more Dog breeds. Cause it kinda gets boring, like once you take care of them, it is basically the same Dog. Over, and over, and over, again! But I still love it, cause I am   ultra Dog Lover!! I like the little talk things, and I love all your games! And maybe... add a station to like breed your Dogs?.. if you could do that, that would just make the game 20 times better! And it is already 1000% amazing! So like I love this the obstacle course, kinda boring, but I still love the game!! If I could I would give a 10 star rating! Max, and I‚Äôm kinda frustrated that you lock some things ‚òπÔ∏è but really when I first started it was weird, because you only have like two kinds of dogs! But now like 1 hour later.... I am like ‚ÄúI AM NEVER DELETING THIS‚Äù I love this game, and I definitely recommend it to everyone who reads this Review!! And it‚Äôs sooo much detail, and the Dogs are soo realistic, though it needs some work... I sometimes get glitched out of the game, but I still love it! It is great, and deserves 5 star!  Thank you for your patience‚Äôs to read this, and I also hope this Review gets a lot of people to play!!!!  Bye bye Peanuts ü•ú "

I mean what is the point of even playing this game if you can‚Äôt unlock the guns and animals without paying?What I would like to see happen is you should be able to unlock the guns and animals based off of the amount of points you have.Overall this is a great game that I highly recommend but it‚Äôs just that one part that should be changed. I love the game and all, and I used to have it wayyy back then before you had to actually buy the app to unlock the other animals which is stupid , I wish the developers didn‚Äôt have to make you buy the app just to unlock the guns and the animals... hopefully they will change this soon cause if not I don‚Äôt see the point of having this game anymore..:/ I downloaded this game because I heard it was made by the same people who made Carnivores Dino hunter. AND I LOvED THAT GAME! I did a report on Dino hunter and Ice age has the same problem....TOO MANY ADS! Please only take away the ads that pop up randomly and please don‚Äôt do the same ads over and over and over and OVER again! But besides that this game is AWESOME! "
‚ÄéBoat Master,"Boat Master is a boat navigation and berthing (parking) simulation game where players have to berth different boats in varying conditions. It is designed to replicate the controls and conditions of berthing and navigating a real boat in a marina and coastal channels (rivers and bays) as closely as possible. Current Features - Drive and berth a motorboat or superyacht (see screenshots) with 2 engines and bow and stern thrusters, using either berthing controls which allow access to all thrusters and easy individual engine control or driving mode which provides a steering wheel and individual or simultaneous control of both engines. - Drive a yacht with a single engine and steering wheel, along with bow thrusters in easier levels. - Drive a speedboat or euro cruiser (larger speedboat) with a single engine & steering wheel as well as realistic tilting when turning at speed. - Drive a motorboat through a channel in various conditions where you need to obey navigation markers and signs as well as avoid AI-Controlled boats going in the opposite direction. At the end of the navigation level, you then need to berth the boat in a small marina. - Multiple difficulty levels and berthing conditions and situations, including:     - A hands-on tutorial level explaining the different controls     - Wind and current which vary in direction and strength in different levels     - Different berth locations and widths     - Randomly timed thruster failure in harder levels - Berth the boat as quickly as you can without damaging it with the built-in time-based scoring system, as well as a 3-star scoring system, which gives you a rating based on your performance. If you don't obey navigation rules, crash, or are too slow, you won't get the 3 stars for the level (specific rules for getting ratings are outlined at the start of each level on the start screen). - Realistic water physics with drag based on speed and realistic boat handling (now including prop walk on the yacht) - multiple camera modes, including views from both sides, the front, back and the top of the boat as well as a camera mode which looks at the target berth from anywhere on the map while keeping the boat in view. - Console and PC level graphics with modern post-processing effects like Bloom, Ambient Occlusion and Filmic Colour Grading (turn on in settings). You can also improve the performance of the game by reducing reflection resolution, increasing the FPS target, and more. A new battery saver mode and the new balanced mode will automatically determine the best settings for your device. - Try the first level of each of the paid boats after watching an ad. DISCLAIMER: This app is not a substitute for real life boat berthing or driving training, some boats that are not the motorboat (like the superyacht and yacht) are paid (they are behind an in-app purchase that costs real money to unlock).  MINIMUM HARDWARE: iPhone 6 / 6S. The iPhone 5S really struggles to run this game currently, as does the original iPad Air. RECOMMENDED HARDWARE: iPhone 6S / 7 / iPad Air 2 or above. When playing on these devices or above it is recommended to turn on Colour Grading and Vignette in settings for a better graphical experience, though if you choose the 'balanced' graphics setting this should happen automatically in version 1.4.1 or above. Turning on post-processing features in settings will reduce the performance of the app, with Bloom and Ambient Occlusion being the most demanding.

This simulator is great just to have a little practice with pulling in and out of slips, of course there needs to be a little tweaking overall. I would love the addition of a Trawler with twin engines and thruster in the bow. My father and I spend A LOT of time fishing in the ocean on his sport fisher and I had him download this simulator as well and he LOVES IT! Just can‚Äôt wait for more features and additions! Just like in the real world, us boaters don‚Äôt mind having to pay to play! :) Hi Jdrj162436,Thanks for your awesome review! As of now there aren‚Äôt any plans for adding a trawler, we will be prioritising adding the existing planned boats and developing a new navigation map and some other planned features. A trawler would be a great addition to the game though so if I can find some time I will look into it, though I cant guarantee that it will be added.  The docking element is fun at first, but not all that realistic. The elements (wind and current) seem to affect the vessel much more right in/near the slip than in the fairway. If planning to align to a slip and then let the wind or current to move the boat to the slip, you will sit two slips down waiting forever. But when in the slip, the wind or current is more than strong enough to push the boat quickly into the dock or the neighboring boat.The navigation element should be viewed strictly as a video game and not at all a simulation. Even when you‚Äôre operating in full reverse or at a dead stop other vessels are more than happy to crash into your vessel‚Äîespecially the PWCs: they not only don‚Äôt hold their course, they will actively change their course into you.Overall, it is fun for the first few minutes and worth getting the free options, but after a few days of playing, I‚Äôm not at all tempted to purchasing any of the options and will likely remove it from my device shortly. I use this app when I‚Äôm not out on my boat. Over the years I‚Äôve owned many boats but leave them in a different state. I would say certain aspects of this are quite good and realisitic however, there is some room for improvement such as, if a PWC crashes into you it should not fail your mission. In the real world, the less maneuverable vessel can hold its ground while lesser maneuverable vessels have to give way. Furthermore, winds seem to affect the boat more at the slip than in the basin. No doubt the graphics are great but some things just don‚Äôt make sense. I also think it would be quite cool to add a free play section where you are able to venture off and explore an open world on your own. To make this more realistic, a first person view would be much appreciated. A cool intentioned game / sim but clearly some room for improvement and added features. Requires iOS 8.0 or later.

Would their be anymore tracks that would be added soon? (Yes I am a 10 year old kid, don‚Äôt judge my spelling, also a summernats lover!) Hey y‚Äôall!  This is a very good game! I have some idea‚Äôs for things you could add, I‚Äôd like to see more cars from summernats like, Inferno, Sicko, etc. Saying that I am a kid, I don‚Äôt know what causes the rear or the car to swing out at the beginning and they move forward, if there is a way to do this tell me, otherwise please tell me. Can we also get a Toyota FJ40 if you don‚Äôt add Inferno and all that, this would be amazing! I would also like to see blowers on all engines, not just for the look, but for more power!!! Thank you for your time. (If you are not the dev looking at reviews for the game and have not bought it, BUY IT!!!)         Update: Yah so, I‚Äôm level 50 now, I‚Äôm getting tired of running the same tracks, and not having enough garage space. We need more garage space for in-game money, otherwise I will end up not playing, and playing more torque burnout, which has a INFINITE garage space, and no buying garage space. Another thing that bothers me again, the lack of tracks, I mean, catch up with torque burnout... I know that you guys have huge potential and you can break free from holding back. This game is so addicting especially for car enthusiasts, I love that you can swap and tune the motors along with the motors being modeled after real life ones (for example 351 and 350 small blocks and twin carbs). This game has so much potential and the only thing I would like to see added in the future is some big block motors and more customization options for the cars (like different colored rims and more types of blower hats). Other than that I‚Äôd highly recommend to anyone who has the slightest interest in carsü§ôüèª "

The update did nothing special. I'd love a newer version with more target fish and more locations. This game is very fun but you need to be able to fish a photo!!! There also needs to be more types of fish. To illustrate, some warm water fish such as bream or bass. Along with these warm water fish there needs to be warm water places. Also one would need some warm water flies such as a popping bug or some kind of dry fly, like a spider. Lastly the depth perception on the lucky tree or what ever is way off and needs to be fixed.  I would be very sad if an update doesn't come soon. Then I might give it five stars. "

I would like to see in the game national teams coaching + players to retire still to be able to be bought/sold + option to skip the match highlights at all + faster loading process.I don‚Äôt like the fact that the transfers are that down, as well the shortlist is so far way, in the menu and that when I sell players they give me very low prices.There should be option between rivals to sell/buy players.The selling process of some players now is more difficult than 2020 and I don‚Äôt like it.The new feature with the sponsor is wonderful, as well the option to recall from loan.It will be better and easier if the bars with how much is left to upgrade will be in different place, probably in training section.Don‚Äôt like that there are limitations on the training days and options.It is more difficult and especially more slow to develop coach/stadium/players/club zone/scouting/youths.It is good that now two or three teams may offer for your player, but it is stupid when they offer the same price. The richer clubs should offer higher for example.There should be a free option to add an extra saving sloth, even 2, like it was with 2019 when you share/like in Facebook or it could be after watched specific amounts of videos, etc. Decent game, but has nothing to do with your ability to play a tactical game. Even if you set players to be certain roles and position, they will not play how you set them. Short pass style for example and your team only scores with long passes ü§î very unrealistic results. Beat Barcelona by 6 goals ( for example). Defenders are running away from the ball most of the time when the other team scores. Possibly a glitch as it always happens. Varane one of the best defenders in the world is very inconsistent  , Ramos gets bad ratings, Icardi (only 3.4.5 rating all games). After 6/7 games everyone complains about not getting first team soccer ( even players on the 2nd team ü§£) . You have to sell everyone that are not in your first team as they are always unhappy. Even when selling players there is a bug. A lot of players reject every offer saying its a backward step, or if they are older are saying they want to retire at your team and you are stuck with them. I gsve it 2 stars only because its a free game. I like how you can create your own tactics this year and customize or just play with it. I also love the match engine this year as the graphics have really improved.What I don‚Äôt like from this year is you cannot sell a player if he acts ‚Äúloyal‚Äù to your team. For example, Jesse Lingard is someone who is on Man Utd‚Äôs transfer list in real life AND he is in talks with Tottenham for a potential move there. So I suggest the developers to eliminate that feature. Otherwise this year‚Äôs Soccer Manager is a very decent game with lots of potential and I‚Äôd recommend this for anyone who is into management simulators. "

Her cub waddled up to her side, riding against her before settling down. Her partner was the alpha and sat beside her. The perfect image was to good to last. A pride was closing in, the females circled the den, clueless of them noticing their every move. Noah (the alpha male) triggered an alert to the females to protect the cubs. The rogue male that joined the pack a while ago made a quick escape, bailing out of the pride, not wanting to end his life today. The rogue‚Äôs alpha male walked up the slope that led to the den‚Äôs main room. Noah stepped down and before they could argue, they were on the ground fighting. Some of the lioness from the rouge pack attacked from behind. The alpha female gathered the cubs and shoved them behind a rock. Her soft nose pushed softly but swiftly and quickly enough for her to turn around and pin a lioness that was about to pounce.      After the fight, the rouge pack lost and only a couple of lionesses survived along with all the cubs. The alpha female and male were devastated and decided to move their pride to the soft-spoken plains with rolling hills and grazing gazelle. It will take them a few days to get their but it would be worth it. Long story short, they regained their pack‚Äôs health and let in new members. Their pack was now the strongest and could take on any pride any time of day.

If you play as the Dalmatians you would start out as an adult male or female and you would live with the couple and the maid and the you could have them take you for a walk. Then eventually you get a mate and then eventually you can have a puppy and another and another and another. And after 4, you could have eventually the option to type how many puppies you want. Or you could go to the pet store and adopt some puppies. And at night you could have your mate stay home and guard while you go to the pet store and try to save the dalmation puppies from cruella devil and the two guys. If you are asleep and your owners are asleep at your home and the two guys show up or are almost at your house then while you are asleep a visual will show up on the screen and will somehow represent an instinct, that should last a second. Then you choose wether you want them to take your puppies or if you want to protect them. After they take them you could give a sound alarm as a bark or a howl to all of the dogs in London. And then you could find them any way basically that you want. If you don't want to deal with cruella devil and the two guys you can have that option. And you can live a regular life. "

Honestly it‚Äôs rather boring. Every episode I did the exact same thing. New outfit, new hairstyle, and a new picture. Then off to the stage to do a routine that lasted less than a minute with three moves out of a selection of three or four for each style. After that get 4 stars (about 10 out of 15 times) and stand there in the same position and have the exact same reaction when one of the judges says something. Then I do it all over again. Once I got to the last about 3 episodes I suddenly failed every time after winning every single episode before. I get that it should be a little harder to win, but not that dramatic. The only reason I kept playing was to win the season, but I lost. I don‚Äôt have the want to to go though another 15 episodes of the same thing over and over and probably just lose again so I‚Äôm gonna delete. There is also extremely limited options. About 10 leotards, 4 hairstyles, only about 6 different pictures you could take, etc. Another thing that is really annoying is that you can‚Äôt practice so the only way to get better is on stage. Gymnastics Superstar is much better and I played it before they added all the other events. "

You can tell they put a lot of time and work into this game. There are a few glitches such as the 3rd hotel when you are starting, the hours of the beach bar. It opens too late so when everyone tries to go there during day time after the restaurant, they skip it since it doesn‚Äôt open until 12. So I feel like there is a lot of lost profit that could be made since no one goes to the bar until night time and it‚Äôs not many people. It levels out once you buy other activities. But it takes a long time to get there. Another glitch is that there‚Äôs 44 guests but the restaurant can only take 12 at a time with a max of 6 people waiting. The third map is too large. It takes over an hour in game time just to walk to the restaurant from their rooms. Guests don‚Äôt check out until the evening by the time they go back to their rooms and grab their bag. There should be a speed walk for the larger map. On the third map, there is a mission that is written the same, twice. One means to unlock 8 rooms, the other one means to fully upgrade 8 rooms. I looked online for what it could be but ended up finding out for myself. Another glitch is some guests get frozen in time and you have to restart the game to undo it. But when you exit out and come back, there are rooms that vacant that weren‚Äôt before. I love this game and I‚Äôm about to start the last map and I‚Äôm hoping there will be more content soon! Hopefully the bugs will be worked on too! Love this game so far.  I feel implementing money transfer from your other hotels would make sense since you have nothing else left to do with the money except hold it indefinitely.  If you max out a hotel why shouldn‚Äôt you use the extra cash to increase the next hotel.  If it seems cheap to do so which frankly isn‚Äôt because that‚Äôs a true business technically then you can increase the next hotel over in price range.  Sure it‚Äôll take longer, but as long as you can benefit from your previous hotel then it‚Äôs literally balancing out the whole economy.  Nerf the money holding by allowing the transfer, but buff all the future hotels so it‚Äôll take longer to building the hotel which allows for longer gameplay and additional fun.  Also you guys have a weird glitch with the Housekeeping.  They sometimes stay in the room and not clean.  They also take the long path to get to a room just to reach the farthest room instead of chronological order. Thought this definitely should‚Äôve been brought up for a fix.  Would also like to mention they take too long to clean even at max upgrade with full staff hire.  Sometimes they don‚Äôt clean at all and I manually have to click the ‚Äúyes, please clean room‚Äù option.  I hope this isn‚Äôt intentional,  what‚Äôs the point of hiring Housekeeping if they don‚Äôt do their job lol.  Please consider the money transfer and hotel buff. Hotel Empire is by far my favorite of all the Idle Tycoon games by this developer. It‚Äôs different from the others in that you are constantly upgrading pieces and parts. You get to see your progress grow in a more visible way in order to build your empire and increase profits. There is a lot less waiting around for things to level up, etc. like with Theme Park. It‚Äôs the most interactive of all of the Idle Tycoon games, in my opinion. I spent the money on the upgrade that allows me to get all of the bonuses without watching the ads and it was completely worth it. It makes the game a lot easier to play, a lot easier to earn spending cash to level your hotel. But even with that bonus, I am still clipping along at a steady pace. I didn‚Äôt instantly run out of game play. I have been playing for at least a couple weeks. Only one star into my third hotel. This game is very fun. If there is a way, I may ‚Äúprestige‚Äù and start it over from the beginning once I finish all of the hotels. The only thing I wish is that there was more to do with your older completed hotels. They continue to earn a TON of money even after you have moved on to the next hotel. There are no kinds of achievements, trophies, or upgrades that you can continue to spend that money on, but that would potentially be a fun kind of bonus/update in the future. "

Core to Stellar Horizon is that its virtual galaxy, including the stars and planets, are all created through random procedural generation using deterministic algorithms. A single seed number is used to create these features via mathematical computation thus eliminating the need to create each of these features by hand. This enables the game to have a massively open nature: it is estimated that with the 32-bit seed number, Stellar Horizon virtual galaxy will include over 4 billion planets. Any player will be able to visit a specific planet once they know its galactic coordinates, given their spacecraft has the capability to do so, and find the same features as any other player, as these coordinates serve as the seed for the planet's topography and environment.",https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Purple113/v4/de/2f/ac/de2fac4a-6a8d-7d39-bfe5-11b021f24729/AppIcon-0-0-1x_U007emarketing-0-0-0-6-0-0-sRGB-0-0-0-GLES2_U002c0-512MB-85-220-0-0.png/1200x630wa.png,explore the infinite space,3.8 ‚Ä¢ 49 Ratings,$2.99,,"March 26, 2020","*Updated review below*I'm having quite a bit of fun playing this. It's a solid space exploration/sandbox game. It has solid yet basic exploration, combat and trading gameplay. I am looking forward to seeing where this can go. I am surprisingly impressed with the implementation of the planetary landing and exploration. The gameplay is basic but surprisingly engaging. My only major criticisms are the difficulty of selecting stars (the star map doesn't help) and a lack of content, but the latter is understandable given the life of this project. Thanks!Update: Ive jumped back into this game since I first reviewed this game a year ago, and the author has added a bunch of features. Planets now have flaura/fauna and explorable bunkers. Ships feature power management now. There are some graphical tweaks as well. This game is still fun and I forward to even more features to expand exploration, trading and fights! I really wish more games in the app store had the feeling of exploration that this one does.  My dream features would be:-Smooth/real-time exploration of planet surfaces -Selectable planets in navigation map -More things to interact with in space (minable asteroids, discoverable things in solar systems, etc) This is the only game on an iPhone that can match other games like elite dangerous so well. Most other games are over the top shoot em ups, but this game is so much more. With a whole economy and guild system it gets really in depth. Depending on the player this can be a good or bad thing. It will be a lot harder to learn and master but when you do, it can give so much content in return. It feels like every day I find something new that I had no idea was in the game such as wormholes, dinosaurs/life, monoliths, and so much more so when u find them it feels like you are progressing. Overall this is a great game that is tough around the edges but if u can get over the graphical quality, controls, and the depth and complexity of the game and want a game to relax to and play any way you want, this is the best to get.This game is great if you are an avid player of games like elite dangerous and no mans sky. This is the game I‚Äôve been looking for! I purchased and started playing (on IPad mostly) just a few days ago and I‚Äôm really enjoying this game. It‚Äôs more in the lines of space exploration, which is what I‚Äôve been looking for. It‚Äôs also nice to play a game that you don‚Äôt get targeted all the time and get a chance just to enjoy exploring. This game has many bells, whistles, and choices and I found it relatively easy to play. I‚Äôm not the greatest at battling attackers when it happens but the nice thing is the developer doesn‚Äôt make you start all over from scratch. Also nice to pay one price and play! Nicely done and looking forward to continuing play and future updates. "

I‚Äôve also watched adds to upgrade parts and they never upgraded parts. While its nice to just watch ads in order to get the gold, the gameplay is a little buggy. Sometimes touches dont register on the steering wheel control scheme and on the cargo transport levels, on some of the vehicles the crago doesnt sit in the bed/container.

It‚Äôs hard as hell to even break even much less make a profit. The pots breaking is stupid and only frustrates the player. 300$ for a pot? So basically they have made this game so hard that you have no choice to spend actual money. Progress is vary slow unlike WS one was. WS one was actually really fun but this newest version is just plain aggravating just to keep the people happy. Can‚Äôt close the store when you run out of weed so your rep goes to crap. Customers who you got bad rep with rip you off. No warning the shoplifter began, I did not find out till I was robbed of all my weed and I had to start alll over again. But the pots breaking is by far the worst. The two stars I gave it was for the graphics and content. However I give it two stars because all the devs seemed to want to do is frustrate the player until they spend money or rage quit. I still have WS one which I play but this one is for the birds. This is a great game, love the weed shop, like growing, yeah yeah, but the very best part is the opossum, Meowie Wowie. She is cute, and good, and wonderful. My day is immediately brightened when she is around. However, she is too good for the cruel weed shop world. Whenever bad guys are around, she bites them, and they hurt her, and then she runs away and doesn't come back for days sometimes. This bums me out. My little possum buddy deserves better. I've tried building pens out of items to keep her safe, but she sometimes respawns outside of them.Could you add like an opossum kennel? Or opposum food to lure her back so I'm not lonely waiting for her for days? Or an option to toggle whether she chases bad guys or not? Let me protect her, I love her like a child. "

There‚Äôs something about building up each new part of the tower bit by bit that‚Äôs just really fun to do. Also the ability to go back and see what you‚Äôve built before is something way more apps like this should be doing, but don‚Äôt, so I really like that I can look back at my progress. That plus updates that add a BUNCH of new floors with almost every update just keeps me coming back. Glad I stumbled on this one So I‚Äôve noticed recently ads haven‚Äôt been working so I‚Äôve been stuck level wise with the bank/tap upgrade. It‚Äôs been going on for day‚Äôs now. The game itself is just alright, it‚Äôs cute if you really just wanna waste time or have something to do while you wait for something else going on, but other than that it‚Äôs just another idle game. The biggest issues I‚Äôve noticed among myself and others is the ad system, after roughly level 6 or so of leveling up your offline bank and cash per tap you have to watch an ad every other level, and for me that‚Äôs a major turn off. If I want an idle game I would want the ads to be for something like speed boosts/time skips/etc. not something you can‚Äôt progress without, and I said at the beginning of my review it hasn‚Äôt even been working for a few days now, so it seems everything that I had worked for and kept this app for is basically now just obsolete. Hello! Thanks for the detailed review. We're sorry that you got a negative experience. In the new versions of the game, we removed some ads, and also added some upgrades without ads watching and added new floors. We are working to make the game better for players. We hope you try to play again.  I love this game. I‚Äôve had it for over a year and completed it at one point before more levels were added. However, after more levels were added after an update, the entire game reset to the beginning. I was disappointed but continued to enjoy the game again. I discovered that after exiting the game it would restart my progress to the beginning of the level that I was working on. At one point a few weeks ago, the game would not open past the loading screen, so I deleted and redownloaded the game. All the same problems have since recurred and unfortunately the game has once again become stuck on the loading screen and will not open. This game is one of my favorites and I would really hope that this is addressed. "

The game is great fun and props to the developer on the graphics, they are excellent. Here‚Äôs a few things that could be done to improve gameplay: difficulty/skill - basically anyone can play this game and succeed (shoot fish and reel in said fish over seemingly unlimited amount of time), so where does strategy and skill come into play? How about the potential to lose a fish in structure or to a shark, or the longer the fish fights the more chance you have to lose it (as in other fishing games) - thus making your reeling vs wait time actually matter and could actually cause you to lose the fish. Also, the holding breath aspect is a bit unrealistic as you can just wait until 1 sec left no matter the depth or situation and get to the surface. Shouldn‚Äôt your breath time decrease  faster while fighting a fish or at depth? and the seconds required to surface vary at different depths? These features can be added with difficulty levels so anyone can play at the appropriate skill level. Lastly, not enough consistency in the fish and weights and structure - kinda gets boring over time. Make these changes and keep adding locations and gear with updates and this is for sure a 5-star game! Thanks for taking the time to write such a detailed review. I appreciate the feedback! You will be happy to know that in the next update (coming next week, hopefully) sharks can steal your fish. There will also be a new fish species, a new hunting location with an interesting twist, 20 new wetsuits, and other enhancements to make the game more interesting. I am a one-man development team, so although I'd love to make this game a hyper-realistic AAA-studio level game tomorrow, that's just not possible. I'm working as hard as I can to build on this foundation. In order to make it the best it can be (and ultimately make Freediving Hunter a multi-player tournament game, which is my big goal) I need ongoing support from players like you. Share the news about this game and encourage your friends to buy it, not just spearos but anyone who likes to play mobile games. Enter the competitions at Spearfishing_Reviews on Instagram/Facebook to win real gear just by playing the game. Write reviews for each update. The more sales and ongoing player engagement I have, the more resources I have to expand the game and implement the great suggestions you've given me here. Thanks again for the review and thanks for playing! Carlos Suarez, Game Developer I feel like having 2-3 sharks constantly at every spot stealing 1-2 out of every 10-20 fish you spear is annoying. The spearing gets repetitive and it takes forever to get money to buy new things. It has room to grow and be a great game but the sharks are too abundant and take too many fish a online game mode and maybe challenges to earn extra money to get gear faster would be nice, after playing the game for a while it get repetitive. Good work could become an amazing game This game in terms of its graphics and real life spearfishing scenario is great. Only down side is the sharks, I truly find no point in sharks eating what you‚Äôve just speared. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that you try your best to aim and catch these fish and to have it get taken away by a shark. That‚Äôs not real spearfishing. This scenario only happens rarely. If I were the developer I would‚Äôve done this differently, I would‚Äôve only added the shark at very rare times. For example, you shoot and catch a few fish and reel them in. Then for a very short time a shark circles your territory for maybe a good 1-2 minutes and then leaves for awhile. But having a shark(s) on your always is absolutely ridiculous especially when you pay 4.99 for this game. I suggest either updating the game having this shark appear ever so often or not even having the shark at all. Thanks "

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it already was! Pro Mode is boring to play against since most people can defeat it easily, online mode is their only choice that isn‚Äôt tournaments or leagues, if only online mode had you BOTH playing at the SAME TIME. That would be amazing. Online shoot outs would be good too! You could train your skills just in case, and for the online matches, it‚Äôs boring when you and your opponent only get 5 minutes to score goals, a panna 1v1 tournament, picking one of your best players on your squad.

I like how if your shot isn‚Äôt too off target, it‚Äôll aimbot into the back of the net, which is great but, the Diamond/World Class players should really get to aimbot the top bin unless that‚Äôs based on your aim.

First, whenever you kill an animal an ad pops up. Normally I don‚Äôt mind ads but this add pops up vertically so I can‚Äôt exit out of it and continue playing the game I have to exit out of the whole game to get rid of it but by doing so the game sends me back to the home screen so I can‚Äôt bring my kill back to base to cash in on it, wasting my bullets and losing my kill. Secondly the game doesn‚Äôt let you climb over hills to spot the animal your trying to shoot  so you have to go around and by doing so scaring away the animal. I‚Äôve heard that some of the other players were having these problems as well and I hope you can fix them this is a really awesome game! Thank you for your consideration and I hope you are able to fix these problems. I was looking for a free roam hunting game with challenges. This game fits that description perfectly! It‚Äôs loads of fun driving around. Physics and everything seem to work great! This game would be an absolute hit, if two things were fixed. 1, the ads popping up after you pick up a kill are broken. I normally don‚Äôt mind ads; but they pop up vertically on a horizontal screen, so you can‚Äôt exit out of the ad and have to restart the game and you lose your kill. Kinda beats the purpose of the game. 2, you can‚Äôt walk up any type of hill. You should be able to walk around the entire map no problem. However, these issues were stated by someone over a year ago and they‚Äôre still not fixed, so I doubt they ever will be. Which unfortunately means I will be uninstalling this game. If you guys fixed these issues I would actually be willing to spend money on this game "

You should know right off the bat that you get four games to start and then buy the others for 1.99.  That might seem a lot for the style and graphics, but I was cool with it.I'm going through it a little and it does seem fun, but the complete lack of any sort of tutorial or instructions is really frustrating.  You can practice events, but I've found myself playing a game over a dozen times and still not knowing what it is really wanting me to do.For instance, I'm assuming that the diving game needs me to land in the water head first, but it doesn't say that.  I'm still not fully sure on how to throw the javelin.  But the game seems promising for the craziness of it.   The events are quick and it almost has a ""Wario Ware"" feel to it.If I can make a suggestion or two... Add a little text to tell us what we're trying to do and maybe a hint as to how to achieve it.  Also, it would be nice to have more than one attempt at something in the ""Games"".  It would be nice to be able to take your best attempt out of three on some events (diving as an example).  Lastly... online play?The game is pretty unforgiving especially since you only get the one shot and there are no instructions, but oddly enough I still find it enjoyable.  I just know it could be better. It's a fun game and I like to play it but.... HOW IN THE HELL DO I PLAY IT. I really honestly don't get it and there's no online or in-game tutorials. I think there should be an update with a tutorial mode telling you how to play each sport. For example: weight lifting??? What do I do???? I always try putting the weight on the person but just end up knocking him over. Kayaking?? I always fall off the back when barely even going!! And I can't figure out a way to keep him balanced on there. So once again fun and I give a thumbs up but..... i do wish for a future update in which the game gives a tutorial on how to properly do all of the sports. "

I downloaded this game three days ago and have spent 7 hours and 30 minutes, some may say that is unhealthy but i am not them. This game has been my life since i dowloaded it, all i can think of is when i will be able to play next. It is a high quality very addicting game that I highly recommend you download. I am not sure if they will be putting out new levels but I am sure hoping they do and if they don't i guess I will have to delete and redownload the app. Anyways I don't want to waste your time reading this when you should be farming various food items have fun kiddos :) I downloaded this game a week or two ago. It was fun, I liked working towards 100% and would spend several minutes on each game. I accidentally deleted it and when I re-downloaded it I found there were suddenly changes. Mainly, each game is timed. I really don‚Äôt like this because I enjoyed moving at my own pace and spending several minutes working towards my goal. Now I feel like even when I‚Äôm making good headway my entertainment keeps getting interrupted when my time is up and I have to restart. I used to spend half an hour playing this game and now when I see the timer end I just shut the game off because I don‚Äôt want to restart the entire level through no fault of my own. I think if you wanted to add timed gameplay, you should have made it a separate mode for overachievers who are interested, while the rest of us just slowly wind around the fields in our own time. Also: I find that when I reach ~90% the game starts glitching. The screen will get stuck and then jump forward so I can‚Äôt tell where I‚Äôm going, what‚Äôs in front of me, or if I‚Äôm about to be ambushed. I don‚Äôt know if it the processing power needed to render the carts or what but I‚Äôve lost many games because the screen froze up and when it unfroze I blindly ran into another tractor. I think that if your not going to give us a gas Pedel at least give us a brake pedel to stop us from colliding into each other. there are some things that make me frustrated! first of all when I‚Äôm half way through the round I‚Äôll be the biggest tractor there, then I‚Äôll see another tractor beside me, I‚Äôll  turn around then BOOM I‚Äôll run into myself!  it‚Äôs so irritating because I can‚Äôt even get through one round without me hitting myself! it makes me so mad I want to smash my phone! Anyways I have another complaint when I‚Äôm near the fence another tractor will come racing up beside me an then he‚Äôll push me to the side of the fence, then make me crash into him it‚Äôs so annoying! (BTW their is not enough hay for everyone,make sure to make the map bigger thx!) one last thing, fix the game so that the big tractors get the right away, it‚Äôs not fair how a two-piece tractor gets the right away! I‚Äôm super huge and can take him down anytime! Anyways other than that, I love this game I think it‚Äôs super awesome and fun I love it!

The English subtitles are off and incorrect. The characters are very well created but stagnant and don‚Äôt coincide with what they are doing in the storyline. The parts (18+) are censored. There are not options aside from character choices. This looks like a great start to a gaming app but it just seems very unfinished. I‚Äôd like to see how the developer updates the app in order to make it more successful! I think I may have preordered this, because I don‚Äôt remember downloading it. But I just tried it and it was quite entertaining. It has a very intriguing vibe. It has some charming issues with its English, but quite understandable. I was left wanting more. It seems more like the introduction to a more intricate story, I would hope there is a follow up to this because it was so short, but the experience provides for quite a good time. The story as given is also somewhat perfect as it is, with a good stopping point. It‚Äôs great at evoking mixed emotions.Tl;dr: this is so short that if you are even slightly less than completely opposed to playing it, you should play it. Great vibe, Love it! When I saw the bad review I got curious about playing so I downloaded. Yes I admit it I wish we could at least put our names for a more personal story. Something to really draw us into the story. However i still loved it very much and I really hope you can make another one. If the creator is reading please make another one cause you got me wanting more and by the looks of things you got other people wanting more too. Just one change and i hope you can do it is to allow us to use our names to personalize the story. "

As far as upgrades go, you must wait until you have earned enough money to purchase any of the given items before you can even read the info on each upgrade. In addition, the upgrades are really expensive; I couldn't purchase any until the very end of the first stage. What I love about this game is the variety it offers. Each stage introduces new mini games, keeping the game as a whole, very fresh. The only changes I would suggest are 1) some type of achievement system would be cool 2) the ability to que tasks 3) fix the bug on      Gwangalli which makes it extremely difficut o place your people at te cafe. I end up wasting so much time trying to find the exact perfect placement at the cafe so my peope won't snap back to their previous location. Has anyone else experienced this problem as well?!?

Great art, great characters, love that you can occasionally choose what answers the characters give. My biggest issue is that bathroom and shower brakes.  They barely give energy as is....why make it harder to keep them. It‚Äôs almost pointless to have them. Also, we should be able to use whatever amount of energy we have left to go towards tress, rocks, etc, to help knock down the cost. So if a tree is 114 but your top limit is 72, you should be able to use all 72 toward that tree so you can go back later maybe finish knocking it out. It seems like it‚Äôs awful difficult to accumulate the amount needed. Granted I‚Äôm currently only level 13, so maybe once you get a little higher it‚Äôll be slightly easier???? Also the current holiday love island and bird island seem almost impossible to get through unless you‚Äôre paying for gems to get dynamite. I had to stop wasting my energy on those cause I‚Äôm not really getting anywhere. I understand you need to make money too but it shouldn‚Äôt be impossible. Throw an occasional ad for energy or something to help. Thank you very much for your review concerning our game. We are always collecting user feedback and emails that we can apply with updates. We've forwarded your feedback to our developers. Thank you for taking out the time to send us your suggestions! Update: After almost completing the treasure island and making and finding the time pieces my fountain still won‚Äôt update! Pease help. When I started this game it was so exciting and fun. I stayed up till 5 in the morning unable to put it down and it quickly became my favorite game. I deleted most of my other games and just played this one. Today I am very frustrated with it. Usually when a new island opens you will get a lot of items that give energy and play for a long time. Since the start of the new treasure island yesterday I haven‚Äôt been able to move anywhere. As soon as I get energy it‚Äôs gone with one item and I have to wait several hours just to spend less than 2 minutes of play. I‚Äôm so upset. I‚Äôm an older disabled person and this is my escape. I finished the last treasure island way ahead of time. I found all the time pieces and cleaned the island. Still my fountain never updated! This new mission looks like I‚Äôll never get it finished and finding the pieces are almost impossible do to the lack of energy. Even the videos you can watch to earn rubies has become limited. After two videos it says I have to wait 8 hrs before I can open those trunks or collect rubies on the shore. Why did it change?  I hope you can fix this. I really wanted to give you 5 stars but I‚Äôm just so aggravated! Thank you. I was having a great time with this game until the Christmas event. First it came in early and completely broken and I was wondering if it was even fixable but really the game just needed to update. It updated and got fixed and my event progress got reset as expected. Then i played through the event a second time and got quite far into star island before it got reset...again. Apparently there were more bugs that needed to be fixed so progress needed to be reset and thankfully the time got reset too. But the second play through i bought the smallest gem pack and collected some gems that i specifically used to buy energy so I could get stuff done quickly and progress in the Christmas event. Now i received 300 gems for my progress getting reset and was told that I would get my gems i spent also in the event time refunded back to me so id be officially at square one with compensation for having to do it again. But i never received my extra gems. I went to support and they repeated you got your gems in every way possible without actually helping me with the situation. I paid money but they really didn‚Äôt care about giving me compensation for that money that i paid which turned me off of the game almost immediately after. I really liked the game but I dont want to play it anymore because if I encounter a problem that only affects me directly I know I wont get the needed support. "

I hope you can add something I have said! Okay so- i love this game and stuff but, you don‚Äôt need to use a bandaid on a dog- or any animal with fur or anything. It‚Äôll hurt taking it off and stuff like that, but if your gonna make a vet game please make it for things it ACTUALLY needs and not a 'bandaid' it looks really realistic the cuts which kinda makes it feel real. Also please make an update we‚Äôre theres atleast 3 of 4 free dogs.

Oh AND please add more things we can do for the 2 dogs!!! it‚Äôs not really fair having to do the same thing over and over again!! please fix this and make more things we can do for the first 2 dogs! Sincerely: Sasha The game itself is fun and fairly accurate as far as these things go. But every time there is a tick to treat, the app glitches and closes (in the paid version). App support doesn‚Äôt seem to load with WiFi or data, no matter where I am. I think it would also be better to include level ups or goals. The free version is SO slow and the apps that pop up but essentially make you quit and start over constantly. To block the adds and unlock everything isn‚Äôt your typical 1.99. Nope, it‚Äôs 7.99- heck of a lot to pay for doing the same treatments over and over with the same 4 dogs, and no real goal other than the few ‚Äúachievements.‚Äù For being about 6 years old, I feel they should have developed this further. Maybe after you have a few rounds, you have to remember what treatments are needed instead of them popping up for you? "

Overall decent game but if your looking for something similar with a larger inventory and just more more in general, I suggest Smash Dude.

‚ÄéWorld of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"Do you know how the insides of a Terminator‚Äôs Minigun work? Try World of Guns: the world‚Äôs most realistic 3D simulator of firearms (and other things from tanks to DeLorean time machines). Find out what makes legendary pistols, rifles, machine guns and artillery pieces tick‚Ä¶ Then disassemble them down to the tiniest part! WHAT IS WORLD OF GUNS? A free-to-play game and an interactive encyclopedia, simulating real firearms in 3D. Here, you can literally climb inside a gun and understand its workings; cut it in half, fire it and bring time to a crawl; and finally, completely disassemble it and put it back again (against the clock if you wish). WoG meticulously recreates historical and modern examples of firearm designer genius ‚Äî from a tiny Liberator pistol to a 16000-pound FlaK 88 anti-aircraft gun. It has both legendary World War guns and rare models that even museums struggle to find. World of Guns puts 200 years of firearm history into a single, sleek and engaging video game. 187 GUN MODELS, 203 TOTAL MODELS AND 25 500 PARTS Here you are guaranteed to find something that catches your fancy: ‚Ä¢	sleek & modern Glocks, P90s, M4s and Tavors ‚Ä¢	guns steeped in history like Colt SAAs, Garands and Lee-Enfields ‚Ä¢	a vast arsenal of Soviet-bloc guns, from various AKs to the rarest VSS Vintorez ‚Ä¢	a dainty pocket derringer or a fire-breathing M134 Minigun ‚Ä¢	a .22 sporting Ruger or a mighty .55-caliber Boys Anti-Tank rifle Not only WoG covers most important models in firearm history, but also the most popular screen divas like Desert Eagle and SPAS-12. TONS OF GAME MODES AND FEATURES Every model includes: ‚Ä¢	modes for learning operation, handling, and field stripping the gun; ‚Ä¢	the armorer mode where you can completely disassemble the firearm; ‚Ä¢	timed game modes, including a hardcore mode and a high scores table. See every detail with the fully controllable camera, layered X-Ray feature and a Cutaway mode, along with complete time control including a slow-motion feature down to 50x. You‚Äôll even see the gasses flow inside a gas block! The game also features: ‚Ä¢	10 shooting ranges with timed objectives (from Glocks to RPG-7s) ‚Ä¢	paint mode that lets you create custom weapon skins ‚Ä¢	mini-games and quizzes with XP prizes UNPARALLELED REALISM World of Guns has been used as a learning aid by armorers, law enforcement and military personnel. To create each model, our team spends months poring over actual guns, photos, blueprints and documents. Each part out of hundreds functions in a physically correct way ‚Äì exactly as it does in a real thing. There are few ways to understand the different firearm actions and systems as clearly. CONSTANT UPDATES  Noble Empire releases several new models every month, and improves the older ones.  Majority of our models can be unlocked for free by anyone; power players will be able to achieve 100% completion and unlock ALL the gun models without spending a dime.

I love being able to take apart and put back together things. I think this game is really really great, it has a lot of potential. However, I wish there were more free things. Also, you should consider updating your previous games (bike & car disassembly) to have better graphics like this one, and make the text a little bigger so it is easier to read! But other than that, you guys are amazing at making these games, please don‚Äôt stop continuing to make them, and updating them. The last review said it was disappointing, but boy were they wrong.  I‚Äôve had WOG for almost a year now, and I currently have very current gun model as of this day. They say it‚Äôs impossible to get credits, but if you do your daily challenges and get 30 right in a row, you get 3 credits every time. Or if your willing to invest money, the credits aren‚Äôt really that expensive. And after all, it is one of the ways developers can get money because they made the game free. Or if you are skilled enough to get 1st for the competitions, you get 1 credit. And if you need xp, just do the quizzes, which are very easy. So no the developers did not let greed consume them, because it‚Äôs very easy to get guns. The only problem I have is that for the whole month of January they didn‚Äôt come out with a new model and instead made some guns free for a few days. So if you developers read this, it‚Äôs February 3, 2019, and you have said many new guns are in production and haven‚Äôt came out with a new gun since December. Other than that, it‚Äôs an amazing game! Gun Disassembly 2 was fantastic and I'm a lifetime member but this new app is a joke. I couldn't be more disappointed. You've turned something awesome into nothing more than a cash grab. Your greed has ruined a once great and useful tool. I wish I could give this a negative rating. You claim this new app is free, yet you have int nationally designed it so that it's impossible to ""unlock"" other models unless you pay. The experience gained vs. the amount needed to unlock anything is ridiculous. If you are going to force us to follow a specific route for unlocking models, then why not do it chronologically. Unlock models based on when they were invented so that we learn the history and development of firearms as a whole. It's absolute crap that I can't choose which firearms I wish to disassemble until I have ""unlocked"" them or use the firing range system until I've gotten further or paid more. Instead of making a new app, why not add the new features to the old app or make it so the lifetime membership carries over to the new app. "

I still kept on playing over and over though, even after getting three stars on every track... So I finally broke down and rummaged through my couch cushions to purchase Legends 2, assuming that it would be a little more lengthy in the career mode. I am not disappointed. To begin, like the other Legends games, the game is beautiful- great graphics, real time damage, graceful physics, and colorful changing backgrounds. If that were all, I would still love it. But on top of that, the gameplay is intuitive, responsive, and challenging. I have to try several times to get three stars sometimes, but I succeed. That's the key to a good mobile game- it should challenge, but not anger the player. This one features a neat rewards system too- pick up little badges to earn parts to new vehicles. Getting to them on some levels adds an extra challenge! I couldn't wait to finish this game before writing a review, so I hope that I'm not disappointed later in the career. But at this point, I'm not sure what these guys could do to disappoint me. It's just the best side scroll driving game ever made for the App Store.

You have survival and creative mode, different creatures, different blocks, weapons, items, blueprints, and miniature blocks where you build inside a perimeter of whatever you want and it will become a 1 by 1 block of what you built which is handy for decorating. You can even create the model of a creature or weapon and give it special effect in the plugin library. There is multiplayer and downloadable maps as well. There‚Äôs even a plant which you can water every day and collect it‚Äôs fruit for loot and unlock the crafting recipe for a new item. There‚Äôs daily login reward, events, skins, drawings, and so much more. However, there is only 1 major problem that I have which is with the machines. There are many different machines but the rotator the one that seems to be glitched out the most. I tried putting all sorts of possible things to give it power for it to turn but it just wouldn‚Äôt move. So, I tried it in a different world and it turned like it was suppose to. But besides that, the game is really good. This game is really great and I really enjoy everything about it. There is so many things you can do, however there is a feature that should be added to multiplayer rooms, when you enter a room the host has the ability to remove you from the room and they don‚Äôt even need a reason, so I would like it if the host of the room has to have a reason to ban someone because I play in multiplayer rooms a lot and sometimes I get banned right away ( I‚Äôm thinking that some people do it because they want people that speak their language) and I think that is ok because maybe they want to make more friends and it would be easier if they speak their native language but sometimes it is ridiculous when someone bans someone from the room for a really silly reason for example the owner is really mean and is killing everyone in game and then they ban the people who run or try to fight back. So I would like it if they had to select a reason to ban someone like maybe cheating or anything reasonable at all not just because they want to. I love this game but it never loads it never does and when characters are talking most of the people playing are different languages like this game needs to be abled to translate almost everything because people in different countries speak different language and when they talk in chat you won‚Äôt know what there saying and it never loads the diy skin the stuff for it never loads and I think there should at least be a way to get more free stuff because most people can pay a lot so I say more clothing and fix the loading for mobile and iPhones and also translate for chat but the translate. also I think you should make a option to add a skin color and allow creative and survival in the same thing. Also please make the game free on pc because some people don‚Äôt have money it‚Äôs really hard especially when your a kid and make some skins for free it‚Äôs not really fair that you have to buy coins to get them but on the other hand it‚Äôs a very amazing game. Thanks for lisoning if you got this. "

I feel like this game would be 100x more successful if you take out the pay to win and focus more on the online gameplay. It‚Äôs a, amazing star you already have a lot of things people ask for!!! Just focus on that online and less things like unlimited stuff in the game such as fuel or race perks and you could find your self with 100x more players !! Also accidentally deleted the app and lost all my progress with in app pitches as well, if there is any way you can reach out to me that would be great, your support link didn‚Äôt work. Many thanks for the highest rating and review! In the nearest updates we will add multiplayer to the game, and after that new regions, stay with us, it will be very interesting! And good luck in the races. This game is great, it‚Äôs fun, you can customize your cars to your liking, and you get to upgrade your cars along the way. There could be more cars but the ones that are there are good choices. The engine upgrades are realistic but could go a little further in depth by doing different levels for each upgrade but I do love how there is a wide variety. The gameplay is doesn‚Äôt have too many issues besides glitching after a burnout and needing to close the app and reopen it and I‚Äôm not sure why when doing a burnout, the percentage goes up early in the burnout but near the end the percentage hardly ever changes while in the zone it needs to be, so 100% is possible but mostly if you get there within the first half of the allotted time. The cosmetic upgrades are pretty cool too but there could be a larger variety. Also it would be nice if you could bet to make more money off of races or do online racing against other people instead of just the computer. AMAZING game! I love the graphics (although they could be improved) the race system, the difficulty, the upgrade system...however, there are some bugs that need to be fixed. For example, when I do my burnout to warm up and the race starts, sometimes the screen glitches and I must restart the app. Another is when I try to watch videos to speed up my chest or to do my roulette spin...the video will ‚Äúbe available‚Äù, but when I try to click it, nothing happens. I would also like to see more cars and customization options, as well as a online race system against other players. When these changes start to happen, I would highly consider making the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù purchase to my game. Keep up the good work! This game could easily give others a run for their $! Thanks for the 4 stars and the detailed review! Information on the problem with advertising rollers received, we will try to establish everything. But sometimes the view button is not active, due to the fact that there is no advertising at the moment for advertisers. Pleasant game and more wins. "

That added to the fact that buying credits is essentially the only way to get more after the few route rewards are used up, I mean 60 credits for an airport and worse yet 6 credits for a fuel tank or maintenance shed *per airport* is excessive when the only way to get more is to buy them. Otherwise game play interesting for now, just 12 years in so let‚Äôs see if it can hold its attraction. The game is ok, but it needs improvement. The first improvement I would add it to add the amount of planes you can add in a certain amount of time. The second part I would add it to make it more realistic and historic. For instance, in real life you cannot fly to North Korea, and until 1991, the Soviet Union was a no fly zone. Also, it seems as if the freedoms of aviation are not properly followed, mainly regarding the 7th, 8th, and 9th freedoms (look it up). I hope you can continue to improve the game and continue to make it great "

I beat the game in three days, the only thing I could complain about is the amount of levels, I‚Äôm hoping for more soon. Not sure why. I see the dev responding to people saying ‚Äúthere‚Äôs not ads every 15 seconds‚Äù, but literally there is. Complete a flop? AD. Return to previous menu? AD. Watch and ad? AD.

I have already finished all the other characters available as well as every character in the Japanese version (I am able to read it so it‚Äôs easier for me] Though it may be that I know what happens to the MC and the characters I still wanna see the characters in the English! Overall the game is good, it takes a bit of time to grind for money if you don‚Äôt wanna pay for coins though, but still possible to get the amount in a certain amount of time! I also wish that you make more games! They are amazing, great quality, and have good characters! I have played all other ones up till now and they‚Äôre all 6‚Äôstar high ranking, in my opinion, and I hope that this isn‚Äôt the last game because I am already excited to see the next game if there ever will be one! So this game is truly amazing and the romance is incredibly written but one of the characters, who should be the Joan of Arc is changed into a male, now named Jean. This is so highly problematic I can‚Äôt even explain so shortly. Joan of Arc was a real woman and her entire life story and significance had a major impact on women everywhere, it is essential that she always is interpreted as a woman. Her struggles were one only women could face and her successes belong to women, not to be washed up as a man. If there‚Äôs anything her life story has taught us- is to GIVE CREDIT TO WOMEN. The change of her gender is not only offensive- it is highly sexist and tone-deaf. She did not die her death only to be later dishonored and even stripped of her gender. I get it that this game is trying to appeal to straight female audiences but why not just use another male historical figure instead of changing a famous female historical figure? This is very wrong. If you really want Joan of Arc, keep her gender and write it as a wlw storyline. A real romance writer will know how to work with that, and if you can‚Äôt write wlw or anything lgbtq related- then just don‚Äôt write romance at all. Again, the game is written beautifully but PLEASE diversify it. Allow the MC to be available in all races, and allow routes for different genders. I love the story and the graphics and sound effects are really well done! I wish there were a way to just pay a flat rate for the stories, because it seems unnecessary to have a social/battle aspect to this game. All in all, I would recommend this with a little patience because it does seems to be a great story so far. Unfortunately, chapters are very short and it‚Äôs costly to try and progress if you consider paying to move forward. I‚Äôve paid for other games before, but I‚Äôd say this is more costly than others compared to the length of the content that you get. For the free options, you can watch ads to get diamonds, but you only get 1 diamond per ad and there‚Äôs a limit on the ads. It‚Äôs disproportionately difficult to use this method to get free diamonds when I don‚Äôt believe there are any paid options below 100 diamonds. They also unfortunately use TapJoy which is glitchy at best and scammy at worst. I‚Äôve never seen TapJoy work correctly in other games that I‚Äôve seen that have it integrated. TapJoy is one of those companies that gives you diamonds in exchange for completing an action or purchasing something. It‚Äôs great IN THEORY, but I have never heard of it it working properly and it‚Äôs unfortunate that it‚Äôs linked with this game. "

Alright, so I have a few ideas. I think every time you equip an item, (not use it) it should make a little sound, like for C4 maybe a click and a beep, Nukes when equipped would be cool if it made a looped air raid siren until used. Also, it would be cool if the natural disasters reacted with weather too. Like Tornados and RainOr a nuke after exploding it snows.(This one might be hard) maybe you could add a freeze time feature but you can still interact with the stuff, along with a zoom in feature so it could be easier to put c4 on cars and other specific places. Maybe you can change the size of the tornado? 2nd to last thing is that the tsunami should push cars with it like a shock wave, all explosions should do that. It‚Äôs weird to see that cars drive through the tsunami. And don‚Äôt go flying after being hit by the shockwave of explosions like the nuke. Final thing: there should be an tap feature were you can pick up cars and knock down buildings by swiping or tapping. It would really give that Playing God feeling. If you did read this, thank you. I love this game Honestly this is the game I‚Äôve been searching for my whole life. And that‚Äôs no lie. I‚Äôve always been searching for a game that you can throw bomb and nuclear bombs into a city and watch it disappear. This gives me exactly that. This is so cool. You guys should definitely download this game if your reading this. There is one reason I gave you 4 star instead of 5 star. It‚Äôs missing some things. As I‚Äôve read some reviews they actually have good ideas. You should add the nuclear, earthquake, tornado, hurricane sirens. That would make it even more believable and fun. Also you should add something where you can make a fire. Like make it so you can light a building on fire. And going along with that you should add to the fire like firefighters that just drive up to it and spray water to stop it. Along with that, I‚Äôve been watching the cars when I do anything to the city and you should make it so the cars react to the situation and run away from it. That would make the game unbelievably cool. And last request is just make the city bigger where you can adjust your view and zoom in and out to wherever you want. All of this would make the game just the best game ever! Like actually! Please just think about my request and hopefully I can see them in the future. Good job on making this game and good luck! "

Also I‚Äôve again realized that after watching the video it doesn‚Äôt collet and I have to watch the video again to get the reward. Another thing is that I don‚Äôt like how the fuel tanks cost actual money to get them at least make it in game cash pleas. On the up side it is a very fun game, and I think that it puts the player at ease. Plus I like how the next level is hidden until you bye it. But another down side is that the peopleüë®‚Äçü¶±üëßüë©üë©‚Äçü¶± take their time when coming in to the airport and I hate how you have to hold the road for more people to come. But overall this is a great game. This seems to be the norm for Codigames. You can play the game without watching ads - at which point it‚Äôs about as entertaining as watching grass grow. Or, you spend the game spam watching ads - in 5 minutes of gameplay, you‚Äôll watch 3 minutes of ads, 1 minute of waiting for the next ad to pop, 30 seconds of wondering what it was you needed to watch the ads for, and 30 seconds of actual game play. They game is fun for about 10 minutes before it‚Äôs spam ads or don‚Äôt waste your time. And those golden birds...  they need to be set to where watching the ad doubles or triples their drop, but you still get something for hitting them even if you don‚Äôt watch an ad. The gem drops for watching an ad are seriously pointless at times. Overall, if you‚Äôre not into constantly watching ads that last longer than the game play, don‚Äôt waste your time on this one. I‚Äôve been noticing for a few days that my screen freezes when I have been given a quest from a co-worker. There is always a yellow arrow and If I click it my app closes down, and I have to wait 10-20 minutes before re-opening the app again. And for the most part, I never really play this game anymore because of what happens. It even effects other apps sometimes, too! I ask my friends about it and they say they NEVER have problems like that. Theirs run smoothly. It‚Äôs strange and I hope that the arrow, or anything that is causing this to happen, will get fixed.

It has a nice story, albeit with some cheesy dialogue. It is a ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù game. It DOES NOT require you to pay to play. Every day, there are ‚Äúdaily deals‚Äù which allow you to collect gems, coins, power ups, or character hearts. There is always one free deal, usually a handful of gems. The other deals are paid for using the in-game currency. To play a level, you need ‚Äúsupplies.‚Äù Your supply meter is full at 50, and each level requires 10 supplies to play. It can be tedious to earn enough gems and coins for upgrades, but if you are patient, you don‚Äôt need to spend any actual money. This game simply does what every other freemium game does: prey on impatience. The gems can be earned through ‚Äúad offers.‚Äù They are sometimes buggy, but you will earn the gems 95% of the time. Be on the lookout for 2x gem promos on these ad offers. They pay dividends! For coins, find a level that earns a lot of coins, and just replay it. I‚Äôve been playing this game for months, and I haven‚Äôt spent any money on it. I‚Äôve also earned max stars on all levels. All the bad reviews appear to be written by impatient whiners. My hope is that people will see past those, give the game a chance, and be patient. If you‚Äôre short on time, it will take you a while to advance, but that doesn‚Äôt make the game any less fun. I‚Äôve played every Diner Dash game and most of the iterations (Wedding Dash etc) since they debuted so I got this game the minute I got a new phone. It has the same fun and gameplay of the other Dash games (although what the heck happened to Flo and why is she now a sharp-faced witchy looking redhead?) and I‚Äôve given it 4 stars for that.But yes, it‚Äôs pay to play. It‚Äôs not if you are the type of person who wants to play for about 20 minutes and stop. On other games like this you only lose a life if you lose the round, but on this game you lose lives even for winning. Your lives run out in about 20 minutes and then you can spend gems or money to fill them. Free gems are offered but not enough to cover say a 2 hour playing session. If you don‚Äôt upgrade products you can‚Äôt progress in the game and the products become outrageously expensive. Even farming rounds over and over you don‚Äôt have enough and need to buy gems to upgrade. They need to either A) make you only lose lives if you don‚Äôt pass the round and lower the cost of upgrades or B) offer a ‚Äòbuy full version‚Äô like they always did. A little suspicious that that isn‚Äôt an option at all on this game. I‚Äôve spent quite a bit to keep playing this as much as I do. This was turning into what could potentially be my favorite game. I‚Äôve already spent over and hour playing it and I just started! And that‚Äôs big because I‚Äôm not a big game person. But the moment you shortened my time to play? You basically lost me. I get that you have to rig the system to try to get people to buy from your shop like with more supplies, keys, or diamonds. But randomly putting a time limit? Here I am just serving the customers and having a grand old time, when my fun is cut short because ‚Äúclosing time‚Äù. First of all, in the real world, If I had already seated the customer and their food had already been ordered, they can stay past closing. They don‚Äôt get thrown out because it‚Äôs time to close. I‚Äôm sure a lot of workers wish that‚Äôs how it really works, but it doesn‚Äôt. And secondly, you rigged the system to where there is no possible way to finish that round without having to buy more time. There are ways to get around not buying the diamonds, but earning them. There are way to choose the fix you want without using keys. And there is even a time limit for the supplies so you don‚Äôt have to buy more. The ‚Äústore hours‚Äù, if you will, is the final straw. So much potential. But you just lost a player. I know corporate doesn‚Äôt mind one player when they have 1,000‚Äôs-1,000,000‚Äôs of players. It‚Äôs just sad because I truly liked this game. And that‚Äôs rare. "

Should also add the option to release full albums instead of just songs. also more HQ upgrades for more artists. maybe longer tours/festivals and larger promo companies etc. This is a really great game probably my favorite mobile game ever but these are just some ideas to be added that i feel would make the game more interesting. i'm always finding myself restarting since it is somewhat easy to max everything out. I enjoy this game a lot. I have some suggestions that I think would make the game a lot better. You should make a feature of creating a whole album for each artist and pick the songs you want to put into the album. Release it the same way and put like a music chart(similar to like Billboard 100 or something) and watch to see where the albums would be placed. That could make much more money towards the label and increase a bunch more fans. Also, this a personal note, could you maybe remove the Sequence puzzle? Cause nobody likes that. As one of the old/new users. I would like to say, I believe this app can be more beneficial for both the app founders and the users by making it more realistic or interesting like, having the options to create your own Artist/Composers or label company individual in the game. who will eventually learn and grow from the progress you are making with the artist and maybe we could stretch the idea of just having musical artist and have more options of different artist because it would give users ideas to think outside the box and look at the bigger picture idk this is all I have at the moment but please anyone reach me if they feelLike this might big something big or even something enjoyable.

With hilarious, self-aware satire and surprisingly deep tactical gameplay, this long-awaited adventure is a must-play for any sci-fi fan and a love letter to all things Star Trek. Okay, this game isn't perfect. Way far away from perfect, actually. But the effort is obvious and I'm not sorry I paid for it. Overall, it's a solid starship command game coupled with some nifty pixel art and some pretty good sound. The story is pretty thin and there's no path other than combat (yet...supposedly it's coming), but as far as it goes for now, it's good at what it does. Combat requires balancing tactics of intership battle and ship defense against boarders. There's damage control to handle, and tactical minigames (which actually aren't annoying at all; they make sense, are well designed, and add to the game). There have been bugs, yes, and there's still a list of unimplemented features, but they're still adding and changing, and it's been for the better. Given another chance, I'd still buy it. Perfect? No. But very good and well worth it. It's also worth noting that this is a developer that actually listens, amazing as that sounds. Player feedback about a really bad game mechanic was listened to, and that mechanic is gone. I'd recommend buying a copy; it's a good sci-fi game, something that's sadly rare on the App Store. Lack of updates is getting to be a real drawback, though. Star Command is the best space RPG I have ever played. Having played this game since release, I know exactly how much fun you can have with this game. I played through the whole game in ""Black Whole"" mode, witch took me an insanely long time to complete. This game is not perfect however. Since release, it has not received an update, and the StarCom Guide app has nothing to say about it. I think that this game has a lot of potential to get better because the base is already there. The larger rooms can have as many people as the small ones witch is a problem. Also, the player cannot invade the enemy's ship and they can invade yours. You cannot see into the enemy ship and control your ship to target the enemy ship's crew. But, I think think this game has AMAZING music. I and other gamers out there know, and we really do know that good music makes a good game great. Overall, this game has a GREAT and ENGAGING storyline that is easy to follow. I absolutely LOVE the design of the ships and their upgrades and abilities. The idea is great, and could possibly become one of the most popular mobile games around. The one problem is that the game doesn't seem to be going anywhere, as it has not received an update even after several e-mails I have sent to contact the devs with new ideas and feed back. Great job devs, and thanks for creating such an amazing game that I have put so many hours into.-Cal "
‚ÄéRailways!,"Do you have a refined taste for games?  Are you searching for the ultimate immersive experience in mobile games? Why do you pour the milk before the cereal? Ouch, wrong chat.  If you answered positively to the first two questions, Railways will certainly suit your interests. From the makers of Traffix, Railways is a simulation game where you have trains, passengers and railways. Your goal is to move the trains strategically between the tracks, picking up the passengers and preventing crashes. Your mission is complete when you collect all the passengers.  Mind the gap and start managing your railways! To manage the trains like a master, you have to learn how to: - Stop a train for a limited time with a single tap; - Drag the train to create a new track; - Automatically pick up nearby passengers and fill the trains;  - Avoid running over passengers when changing the route; - Prevent crashes between trains. Railways features minimalist and artistic elements merged in an immersive experience where the perks of a train trip are emphasized: astonishing landscapes observed at a slow pace. Each level will bring a new challenge to the track, more chaos and of course clever moves from your side. All aboard! This train is ready to depart! How much time can you keep the trains moving? Find out now! This new game by Infinity Games is a magnificent train simulator where patience is a virtue. In order to succeed, you need to wait for the right moment and use your skills to drag the trains from one railway to another. You know that you will lose if the trains collide but you also know that you have all the time in the world to make a smart move. Furthermore, you can also stop the trains for a while.  If you have the patience of a monk, you will have a great time with Railways! If you are an impatient person, you can use Railways to improve those skills! Features: - Premium look and artistic features: you will not just play a mobile game. You will behold a masterpiece!  - Immersive gameplay: after a couple of levels, you will find yourself absorbed by Railways imaginary world.  - Curated levels crafted by train conductors: Railways levels were designed by train conductors with +10 years of experience.  - Multiple achievements to conquer: picking up the passengers is just the beginning. - Smooth difficulty curve Did you know that 0% of players passed level 1?  That is because at the date I am writing this text the game is not yet released.  Infinity Games aims to provide the best game experience within its titles. We love showcasing new minimalist puzzle games and making people think while relaxing and having fun. Do you like our work?

For the developers, the randomness of whether a train will stop behind the train ahead of it takes each game from being skill to just lucky. If this was fixed, I believe it would be more enjoyable and less frustrating. Fun p but there are some bugs. Don't swipe down to Notification Center to see what time it is because the game UI will stop responding and require a force quit.Track jumping could be more forgiving--several cases where jumping across tracks is straightforward, but the game says it's not allowed to, but sometimes it is. It's inconsistent.Last, I think it should be possible to lay track or reroute trainers before they come back around the other side of the map instead of having to wait for the train to appear before it can re rerouted. The controls are sluggish and unpredictable. You can‚Äôt create track until your train has come back around to the beginning, so it‚Äôs hard to make and execute plans ‚Äî you wait around a lot for your trains to be controllable. And the crash heuristic is unpredictable ‚Äî will the rear train stop and wait? Or plough right into the front train? It‚Äôs impossible to know.Edit: had to drop another star when I got to level 4. It‚Äôs just impossible to draw the track to where you want it to go. Really‚Äîso close to a cool game, yet so far. Hello DoodaddyThank you for the constructive feedback. The sluggishness and unpredictability you find in the controls was our way to simulate and recreate the feeling of managing a train while remaining loyal to our style and identity. It's a shame you didn't like it. As you notice, it's not possible to draw the track when there is not enough angle to do it. That's a mechanic limitation. Those nuances bring some freshness to each time you play. I don't know if you played our previous game Traffix, but there were some similar features there too. I hope you can get more amusement from Railways in the future. We would love to get a 5-star rating from you.Feel free to send us some suggestions to support@infinitygames.ioThank you. "

Please please please after u make the next sim make a zoo sim sorta I mean, where the habitats are huge and you can break out and..um..you...unlock new animals and you can breed and you start as the baby animal that u are you get a choice between three animals,a sea lion (that can swim and walk on land),a river otter (which can do the same),and a dik dik (the tiny deer like creatures) and then u can unlock 5 flying animals, 10 land animals, and 8 water animals (I know it would take a long time but it's cool) and to get break out you have to be level 3 and when you break out they return you to the wild,also to get food when you're in the zoo you have to wait till morning,afternoon,and before sunset, they feed you at those times,and to breed you can be level 5 and they bring you to a breeding center (if you choose to stay for one day)or you find the breeding grounds in the wild, that's all! Also... Stay wild! ü¶Åüêæüê® The new update improves the lag SO MUCH. It still crashes every couple of minutes, but my device is old, and it's a lot better then crashing every 30 seconds. It's a much better game now, so thank you, Gluten.A few tips to whoever' reason this-- to get to the underwater ship den, you have to go to the bottom level of the ship. There's a hatch you can go down on the two upper levels, or some handy windows at the very bottom of the sunken ship. Then, at the bottom level, there's a wall with two shark-sized doors. Past the wall is the den.To get away from an opponent you don't want to fight, press the red X and swim away. Sometimes the opponents will be very fast, so I'd press the button for Fast Mode so you can get out of there sooner rather than later.To get around the crashing, pick a den close by to where you do most of your stuff. The underwater ship has lots of prey and a nice breeding ground nearby, but one den (can't remember which) has barely any prey. Which can be a challenge when the prey is hard to catch. If you pick a good den, you don't have to lose much traveling for food/a mate whenever it crashes.If your shark becomes a laggy mass of random pixels, don't worry. Just wait a bit, particularly further underwater. It happens more to me when my head's poking out above water. "

‚ÄéMagic 8 bit 8 ball,"In 1983 a potent mixture of dark magic, sorcery, voodoo, and star anise was all captured in an 8-ball which then gained the power to grant answers to questions that were stated in a very specific way.

Luckily for you, we've captured all the dark energy from the original artefact, and have injected it into the app you are now downloading. Typical valid questions include: - Does [person x] love me? - Will time travel be possible one day? - Should I go out for pizza tonight? - Should I download this app?

Now in the digital age and stuff and room is at a premium, it is great to have the same answers to life‚Äôs and the universe‚Äôs questions right on your iPhone‚Äôs home screen.

I live by the creed of one question, one shake and one answer!I can verify that if used correctly it is at 104% accuracy.  This is so much better, exponentially better than flipping a coin and not as complicated as random numbers. Often I don‚Äôt have a coin and random numbers escape me most times.

Through all the puppy‚Äôs expect for Abby. Now it won‚Äôt let me go any further with missions which I don‚Äôt understand why. Like I just have stars sitting there waiting for it to let me finish up that section. I‚Äôve tried reopening it nothing happened. I tried deleting it and reinstalling it still nothing happened. I just don‚Äôt understand why. Other then that it‚Äôs a very good game to play. Very addictive and fun!! I absolutely love the idea of the game, the dogs are so cute and the gameplay is fun BUT, I waited quite a while for the creators to make more levels after finishing everything there was to do and I didn‚Äôt mind waiting because I loved the game. Now that they have made more levels I am unfortunately stuck at level 77 because I‚Äôm supposed to be getting  15 bowls, 15 leaves, 6 cats and then it shows crackers or treats with the number ‚Äú0‚Äù next to it. The problem is that those crackers are all over the bottom of the board and they grown if you don‚Äôt take them out quickly, BUT since there is no numerical value listed as to how many you should get other than ‚Äú0‚Äù, you can never fulfill it, so you can never finish the level. Highly aggravating because I LOVE the game but apparently the creators haven‚Äôt checked it well enough before putting it up on the App Store.  Maybe they‚Äôll get someone on their team that pays more attention to detail?  What a shame. I just got this game today and am already on level 50! It‚Äôs so fun and satisfying and absolutely adorable! I also love that it actually has the story that the ad shows, unlike a lot of other games I‚Äôve tried out. I would totally recommend getting this game! The only probably is if you have an old device, this might not be the best game for you, because I got this on my phone and it worked perfectly but then I got it on my tablet and it was a bit laggy. So 10/10 would recommend, unless you have an older device. üòä "

Also please bring back the curve technique or setup that y‚Äôall use in FIFA 19, FIFA 19 curve‚Äôs were so smooth, but now if you curve it it goes so high up and that makes the keeper react to it, I have a 90 rating player with a high curve that and it doesn‚Äôt even look like the ball curves. It curves so slow. And one last thing please and I mean please Netflix the goal keepers they react way to fast even at a low level. It‚Äôs almost impossible to score a goal. The game is pretty good but with those fixes it will make it even more better and more fun to play. First of this isn‚Äôt going to be any rant or anything just a suggestion on how to make the gameplay a bit more enjoyable. To start of everything is greet in your game. Your really generous in giving in game energy, skill boosters, tokens, and many more things, and I really love how I can create teams with correct positioning and chemistry and then play with those teams in vs attack and world tour, but here comes the problem. Often times in vs attack you face people with much higher OVRs than you, also they always have a higher chemistry then you. Take me for instance I‚Äôm nearing world class division two with an OVR of 88 and a chemistry of 120. Now you may be thinking that‚Äôs not half decent, but can you really think that when you are going up against people with OVRs of 93 and higher, and not to mention they always have 130 to 140 chemistry compared to my 120. I always get really frustrated when I just need to win one game to rank up and then I ended up going down then up then down then up until I just end up at where I was before all of it, and for this instance I propose some type of match making system not on trophy‚Äôs, but on OVRs and people‚Äôs chemistry. This is all I really had to say and complain about, but in the end I‚Äôm just happy to play the game                IGN  IAmAGremlin Since the new update to make the game more like the console fifa, EA has done quite a few mess ups. I‚Äôve been logging in every day since the 19th of September and I still get sucked into a loop where I cannot get out. I tried calling EA and I had a very good phone call and the man said that they would have a new update out ASAP. He said to have someone send you a ‚Äúleague‚Äù invite and then it should get me out of the loop....well I‚Äôm in a league and I can‚Äôt get out of the league because as soon as I sign in it wants to teach me about the new ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù addition to this game.

You can help design homes in Hawaii and the finished looks always look amazing! I recommend this game for at least 10 year olds and up. I love this game and I play it almost every day! This app is great! I have not seen any glitches or bad things in it, but I do have one complaint. Some of the levels are VERY hard to pass, and in order to pass them you either spend real money to buy more tokens to earn a FEW lives, or you waste huge amounts of your tokens to buy a FEW extra lives. This game is awesome and I hope that this game can be edited so the levels are easier to complete. I hope that is a change that happens. I recently realized that spending real money on this game is not good, because you will waste it. Spending your money on in app purchases in this game is a waste of money. If you get this game, please don't spend your money on it. I love Hawaii and interior design so when I found this game it was perfect! You get to pick from three options on anything. Most games like this usually get super hard and unbeatable, but if you have enough power ups your good to go! The thing I love about this game is it‚Äôs fun, I love all the scenery as well. If your unsure about this game , give it a go! You‚Äôll never know until you try it! This game is awesome! I‚Äôve been playing for months and spend quite a bit of money on it, and I‚Äôm disabled so I have to be careful what I spend. Twice now I‚Äôve paid for the $4.99 package and just as you take my money, the app says fatal error and crashes! When I restarted on both occasions I didn‚Äôt get back what I‚Äôd paid for, I just lost $8.99 and got nothing! If this keeps happening I‚Äôm not going to be able to make any pay in app purchases anymore. Can you fix this, or give me a refund please?

The problem is that once you get the evolution guide, you can see all the evolutions and there are no more mysteries. It would be cool if there was something like a mystery evolution that doesn‚Äôt show on the guide, and it doesn‚Äôt show how to get it. Yeah, sure, once you get it, you know it, and no more mysteries, but just imagine how much fun players can have while finding the mystery evolution. They can try to guess what it is, and try doing different things with the pet thing üòÇ. Just so you know, I haven‚Äôt bought any of the other special eggs, so I don‚Äôt know if you maybe already put it there. The other thing I was concerned about is that the minigame called It‚Äôs Raining Meds is actually way too hard for me. Make it a teeny bit easier, just so I can have a tiny bit more coins from that minigame. Other than those two problems, this game gets 5 stars all the way! This game is very fun but I think it needs more things to do. Mini games you can only do if your Hatchi has enough energy, and the hatchi jump thing I have already beaten. I think since you literally have a baseball bat and a ball for games, you should add baseball, and in the future maybe add other sports. Soccer you could have as a multiplayer games where your hatchi goes against another hatchi trying to both defend your goal from the other hatchi scoring, and try to score on the other hatchis goal. But other that that the game is overall fun and addicting. It brought back instant memories of the one I played back in the 90‚Äôs.  Plies this one is easier to keep hand given it‚Äôs on my phone which in turn is Always with me.  I wish the in-app purchases were a bit more economical - with being on disability after an amputation it‚Äôs hard to stay on track in keeping spending down.  All in all I‚Äôm more appreciative to have the game back because it does help pass the time! "

‚ÄéMerge Town!,"Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it‚Äôs your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you‚Äôll be gifted with a house. Each house can be merged with other houses of the same variety to form a bigger home. Every house built on the land will earn you money - the bigger the home, the more you will earn. The more you earn, the more houses you can purchase, and the more you can push the clock to develop faster. Use your spoils to discover new homes, and to expand into all new towns. You have a singular goal: make your towns the best they can be. The bar at the top of the screen measures development - Merge buildings to earn XP and level up. Higher levels will unlock more space in your plot for you to develop, which will only allow you to develop your town to even further greatness. Once you develop into new towns, keep an eye on all your land, ensuring that you‚Äôre merging and developing to your full potential. Merge, build, and develop your very own towns with Merge Town!

If anyone has a bad review about it like ‚Äúit did not work‚Äù or ‚Äúthis game is so boring‚Äù I think that they‚Äôre missing the point of the game... Having fun! If it doesn‚Äôt work I feel so bad for them. I may as well merge this review bigger! I think this game is da üí£ because it‚Äôs so fun and I think if it were more fun I would actually play it daily! Please get this game if you want. You do not have to but it‚Äôs just so fun. Sure there is more merge games but I think this is da üí£. I have had merge plane ‚úàÔ∏è and that was a good game but this is better. I first found out this game when my sister had it. I thought it was a really good game, so I got it. At first I said this is not bad! So I kept playing and playing and playing till‚Äô I wanted to play something else. I have been playing that game for hours! I might get more merge games and make a file of them! I hope everyone else LOVES this game like I do. BTW what if there was a version 2 of this game.. that would be my dream so far to this game. I‚Äôm sure it would get more likes than the original one.. ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Also have a great day! I love those little zen games, the ones where you can just fidget with an app without worrying about timers or points or lives. This is set up to be one of them, but it quickly becomes nothing more than an ad-intensive experience. You start off easy enough, get a crate every 10 seconds which gives you a house, which you merge with another house to get a slightly bigger house. Merge two slightly bigger houses to get even bigger house. That's pretty much the entirety of the game, but unless you really are willing to drop cash on the developers for this, you're going to hit a very real issue. Since the starting blocks never increase, each consecutively larger building takes twice as long to make as the previous. Forcing you to spend the in-game currency that your houses have been generating, or die of old age as exponential growth takes over. No problem so far, but opening the buy menu triggers an advert 50% of the time. Menu options should not be gated behind ads. Ads to get bigger houses, ads to get a few 'free' houses, ads to increase the size of those houses, banner ads while you play. Ads while you change town. Ads when you open up the buy menu. Ads when you bring the game back to the foreground. This is more ad than game, and while I'm very tolerant of ads and the need for them in a free-to-play game, this title is over the top. Ive had this game for a day and I'm Already at level 16 for Greenland and level 11 for sunsetland, and I'm super excited about unlocking Winterland!I love how many different buildings you can unlock and I also love how I will come back from playing another game and both worlds will be full of boxes and I can open them and keep playing!And I get so excited when I discover a new building!most of the reviews will complain about the ads but they really don't bother me!I love everything about this game and I would love if you kept making updates! (a cool feature is you could press and hold to speed up the boxes and another cool thing is that you could spend in-game currency to get box upgrades instead of using real money!)THIS GAME IS MY FAVORITE GAME!

‚ÄéA Story of a Band,"*** Pocket Gamer Awards 2013 Nominee for Best Simulation/Strategy Game *** Put on your leather jacket, grab your guitar and lead your band to success in this management game filled with attitude! ‚ÄùMy mind is not as clear as it used to be, but I believe it was 1965 when we started. Our manager was a pretty peculiar fellow, ‚Äôcause we never even saw him (or was it her?) in person. Instead we got our orders through some kind of a mobile device. It felt strange at first, but it worked well. Our days were filled with typical band activities: we made albums, toured, went to interviews, performed on TV and trained relentlessly. We learned various skills and spent our hard earned cash on items that helped us on our journey. Occasionally we had to prove our worth by facing other bands in a Battle of the Bands contest. We used to experiment a lot, trying different styles of music. There were plenty of genres to choose from, and each one gave us sort of special powers. We even founded a couple of genres ourselves. During the first years, we had this underground thing going on. We had a nasty reputation and lots of loyal fans. But as our fame grew, people started accusing us of selling out, and little by little our music became more mainstream. We developed a line of merchandise, and money started pouring in. Eventually we even had our very own record label, and we started producing albums for other bands. Everything didn‚Äôt always go smooth, and we sure had our share of problems. Our bassist was a heavy drinker and spent lot of time in rehab. We also had to kick out our original singer because his attitude towards the rest of us became unbearable, and we grew tired of fighting with him. All in all, those were pretty fun times, and I would definitely do it all again.

‚ÄéElectric RC Sim,"Experience all the fun and excitement of RC plane flying without leaving your chair! Electric RC Sim is a flight simulator for radio controlled aircraft. Fast startup plus realistic physics and graphics make it a pleasure to fly. Use it to learn to fly (I did!), hone your skills, or just have fun flying around. Learning to fly an RC plane takes practice, and Electric RC Sim can help you learn much faster.  If (when) you crash, just press the reset button and you're flying again. There's no need to fuss with building, repairing, or waiting for a calm day, saving you time and money. Includes:  * two drones: simulates 4 motors, 3 axis gyro, PID controllers. Practice flips!  * all my favourite aircraft: two trainers, a slow flyer, an aerobatic plane and a flying wing  * aerobatic plane: learn to perform moves such as knife edging, snap rolls, ground loops  * P-51 for some scale flying fun  * ducted fan jet with massive control surfaces: crazy fast and crazy fun. Do flat spins like Maverick!  * control line plane: great for learning control basics  * ""antigravity"" trainer: have fun while learning the controls without having to worry about gravity  * four different flying fields, each with different wind conditions  * handy help guide for beginner pilots Features:  * detailed nonlinear nonstationary flight dynamics model  * photorealistic graphics  * intelligent camera view and zoom helps improve sense of space and speed of your plane  * landscape and portrait view: portrait view helps with sense of altitude of your plane  * works great on iPhone; looks amazing on iPad  * realistic engine sounds: gotta love the sound of a screaming brushless! Advanced controller (available as an optional In-App Purchase):  * set rates, expo and trim per model  * access to additional drone modes:    - hold: gentler for beginners    - expert: a blend of acro and auto levelling    - acro: sticks control turn rates - flies just like a 3d heli! To prevent accidental purchases, you can disable In-App Purchases in your device settings. Customer reviews: ""I received a physical quad copter/drone as a gift, and having never been around one had issues flying it. I was hesitant to practice, fearing causing damage to the flyer or persons/animals. I found this app which allows simulated flying in a safe environment with the exact controls my particular model used. After a couple days with the app I was able to fly the real thing with confidence, and within a week was completing flips, spins, fast direction changes, and expert maneuvers. I can't recommend this program enough."" ""What a great training tool... Superb stall and flight control simulation. Love the wind..."" ""Most realistic rc sim at the moment!! ... novice to experienced will enjoy"" ""Portrait view is a great idea, and the camera zoom works perfectly. UI is simple and to the point..."" ""Once I heard the word 'flips'... Awesome"" Check out ""Electric RC Sim Lite"" if you'd prefer to try before you buy.

This app is on my tablet and allows me to have fun flying anytime I have a few minutes.  Nice selection of different style planes for each flying preference.  I also like the new quad....it would be nice if there were maybe a small beacon of light (LED) on the rear to keep me oriented.  The black and green props can sometimes be hard to distinguish at a distance, especially if you do flips.  And even though I don't fly with thumbs only on my transmitters, I have no problem making the adjustment at the flying field.  I have tried almost every flight sim app in the App Store....this is by far the best! For less than the cost of a 16 oz coffee, this little sim offers a way to start anew, or brush up on your RC flying skills.  The choice of planes and quadcopters is great and they seem to me to be quite realistically modeled.  I put about three hours of time on this sim before getting back into the air with an RC trainer after a 20-year hiatus.  It definitely gave me the confidence to toss that new plane in the air and fly basic maneuvers again.  The latest update includes a new flying environment and an aerobatic quad.  Nice to see the developer offering substantial updates to his product. I've had electric rc boats and cars for years. Every couple years I would build a plane only to crash it on its maiden flight(stall!)   I'm not as good a pilot as I thought I would be.This app is easy to use and feels realistic.  I was really able to see progress in my flying skills after a couple hours of practice. I'm so glad I didn't have to build all the planes I've crashed!  I then upgraded for the extra fields(different wind conditions) and planes which have been fun to play with.   Really for the price, it's a bargain! Requires iOS 6.0 or later.

There‚Äôs so much stuff that I want you guys to add to this game. But I understand this is just the first superbike simulation. I hope we will have the next version of this game, not just an update :D And btw, I really really wanted to customize my team color and rider somehow.... developers We're sorry but the race sim option was removed following complaints from several users that the game was far too short: over-using such option throughout the game, many players finished it in under 2 hours and it was no fun. My app crashes everyone I get to my first Superpole 1. I get through all three of the free practices, then it goes to a loading screen and crashes.Update: After deleting and re-downloading the app, I can get past Superpole 1 and 2 but the app crashes when I go to the loading screen entering the first race.Re-Update: After deleting and re-downloading the app 5 times, I‚Äôm still not able the get to the first race; the app crashes while loading.

First you‚Äôre should be able to walk around. Next you need storage for your equipment and maybe some flatbed trailers and gooseneck trailers too. It would be nice if we could have dogs and pets. John Deere should be a bigger part of this game.      A bigger map and should be able to go into a house and sleep and have a family. Ford pickups should be included with bale beds. We should have round balers and not just square balers. Loaders should be on some tractors. You should be able to talk to neighbors and sell fields or ranches and you could move to a new house. You should put multiplayer in and you should herd in cattle in your trailers and not just drive right up and they load. Overall it needs to be more realistic and you should have a town. You should be able to crack and dent stuff.          I want to actually wreck or hit a car cause they are as hard as a rock and won‚Äôt move when you hit them.  You should be able to build barns and get hurt.

You should be able to have a settlement with people and survive. Maybe fishing in the next update with some boats. The lighting is a bit reflective at night like too shiny possibly a bug. Also one issue there is random ads popping up during the gameplay when I‚Äôm being attacked or doing something important. Please remove random ads popping up during gameplay and just have ads at the beginning of loading screens only so it won‚Äôt be bad! Just keep improving the game!Edit: Lights and torch‚Äôs can‚Äôt be placed anywhere no matter what I do! Game Bug? Ceiling light can‚Äôt be place on bottom floor ceiling or any game block I tried everything and it‚Äôs just red and won‚Äôt let me place it anywhere same with the torch. Game play is pretty smooth overall. My biggest disappointment was that lack of threat there is. There is not really much to worry about. The game is almost too easy. There are not that many items and really nothing to discover or unlock. More things to gather and possibly fishing would be a start. You can‚Äôt use spears while walking or running. Even the ‚Äúred‚Äù threat level characters go down in a spear or two. There is never enough enemy to kill you. You can take the time to gather the items you need to build guns or other things but why when it is basically given to you through supply drops. It is not a challenge and is only fun for a little while. You have to be standing near the furnace for metal to keep being created, and that can get really annoying. This game could be really good with a lot more development. More enemies. More items. Possible an enemy that will wander more. I would like to have a sense of some sort of danger to be on the lookout for. A map would also be amazing. Different terrain would make things a little more interesting. Larger creates to put things in is also a thing that would be amazing. Even the metal boxes don‚Äôt hold very much and you have to have a lot of them. Overall I would not waste your time on this game. Not enough to keep you busy and interested Hello developers, I hope you read this so you can make this request your priority to improve this game. First of all, this game has lots of potential and much better than the last Survival simulator game. Just a few requests to make this game really good. First of all, remove the in game ads so this game is actually playable! I don‚Äôt care if you have ads when you exit or enter a game but all I ask is don‚Äôt put ads while playing the game. People will not like that and might quit if that keeps up. Secondly, there needs to be a way to respawn to your base or put a home symbol on the minimap. Like Survival Simulator, the bed should be a waypoint to your base. This will avoid people losing their base and would make the game a lot more smoother. Last thing, there are a few bugs that should be fixed, one is when I drag a item to another hot bar, sometimes it freezes on the screen and I see it even when I close out of my inventory. Also items tend to randomly disappear for no reason, that should be fixed. Anyway I think these requests should be your main priority to make this game improve. More people will download when these are fixed. Also soon plz add multiplayer! Thanks. "

The game runs perfectly on mobile devices and the play style matches works perfectly for phones. Salvaging animatronics is a unique twist on your typical FNaF game. You find an animatronic out back and you can choose to salvage or throw it away. Of course salvaging comes with a risk, as if you fail to salvage the animatronic it will run loose in your pizzeria and make the night shift Part even harder. The more animatronics you‚Äôve salvaged or failed to Salvage will make your life even worse as they‚Äôll try to kill you as well. During your night shift your job is to do basic jobs to improve your pizzeria such as order new supplies and print posters. Of course there are two vents that the animatronics will try to come and attack you from, meaning audio is very important in this part of the game. Being able to hear an animatronic in each of your ear makes the experience even better and more terrifying. Of course nothing everything has to be scary though, As one of the main parts of the game is building your own pizzeria, you make money improve your pizzeria repeat, surprisingly this part of the game never gets boring especially with fun mini games you can buy for In game currency and play for a better rating and more money. After purchasing this game and playing it for some time, I have to say, I am quite pleased with it‚Äôs performance. It just runs so smoothly as if it was designed for mobile in the first place. Also, the fact that Clickteam managed to port the full PC version of this game over to mobile without any downgrades is very impressive. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs definitely worth the money to buy, however, I have noticed a few issues I would like to address. First of all, I ended up getting jumpscared by one of the animatronics when I never even salvaged them or threw them back into the alley. Now I‚Äôm not certain if this is because I bought a risky item beforehand or if it‚Äôs just a bug. If it is, please take the time to patch it. Second, it does not save any of your achievements if you start a new game. Now once again, it could be possible that it‚Äôs supposed to be this way, but I can‚Äôt say for sure. Third thing is that as you progress into the game, the nights can be become extremely difficult to pass, and in some cases even impossible. So please change the nights to make them just slightly easier. Other than that, the game is perfect and extremely fun to play. Scott and Clickteam really did it with this one (PS: Also, if we could get an estimated release schedule for mobile UCN, that would be great, thanks!) First of all I‚Äôd like to say that this is a very nicely designed game. I enjoy the nights, and the salvage levels, and managing my own pizzeria. But most of the game has no sound at all. Which makes it ten times harder. I can hear the guide, I can hear the Sponsors, but I can‚Äôt hear jump scares, I can‚Äôt hear the ventilation, I can‚Äôt hear animatronics inside the ventilation, I can‚Äôt even hear the computer when I‚Äôm doing my tasks. Yet the sponsors are loud as can be. I don‚Äôt understand why this is happening. in other reviews most people are complaining about the same Thing. And to be honest I don‚Äôt blame them. All problems aside though I think it‚Äôs somewhat worth getting. And when or if the sound problem gets fixed, this game will definitely be Worth $2.99. Developers if you read this please at least try to fix this problem. Also to whom ever is reading this.. this game is definitely worth playing and offers great game play. Id suggest getting it.

The only thing is.. They should make it more realistic. For instance cubs should grow up, and I realized that as you walk along everything loads as you approach it, which means there is a blank horizon, which makes it seem less real, should have completely loaded horizon. Lastly, Gluten  free games  should not let you eat an animal as big as an elephant in one bite. I know they have a policy against blood or gore but they should at least let there be bite marks on the animal as you eat it. However, though I still recommend this game since it's pretty fun  to survive in the jungle and desert. So I thought instead of having a little home spot BORING you could have a den similar to the one in the lion sim and there could be a hole so you can go in the den also you should have a lot more Cubs like six 2 at level 5 and the rest at level ten and there should be water falls and you can transport to other simulators that the player has and you could have wars with the animals from the players Simao you have to have a bigger map to all the sims that the player has and you can pick things up with your mouth and steal animals Cubs (the ones from the players sims if they have any) and when you bring it to your home/den there would be an button that says ""raise""and if you press it the cub is yours although there would be a 98% chance that the parents would be looking for its cub or pup and there would be different ways to steal Cubs or pups make the next update on my birthday August 14th bye I love this game‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòÇüòäüòäüòäüòäüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòäüòéüòéüòéüòéüòé I have a few suggestions , the Tigers head looks smaller than its body so make it bigger if your going to make a ultimate tiger simulator also the control movements need fixing  you should update them to uws controls.

Remember the teaching: ""Become the ball."" To play drag the paddle with your finger. Flick the paddle left and right to control direction and spin. The winner is the first to score 11 points or higher with a 2 point advantage. Service alternates every two points. Press your score at upper left to bring up the menu.

This is one of the games I was hoping someone would make.

That‚Äôs the idea that sparked a world-building phenomenon in Mojang‚Äôs amazing Minecraft. Since the game's release on the App Store, a steady stream of meaningful updates has kept this cube-filled universe fun, fresh, and jam-packed with exciting features. I enjoy this game till this day, if you knew like me what the nether reactor core and when you could glitch stack armour. It has changed so much and suddenly blew up out of know where! I have been creating boat racing maps, and almost everything I can imagine. If you can imagine it build it, not only does it show how creative you can be but also make you get more ideas, it‚Äôs almost an addictive cycle. Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad. But what they did to the game is so amazing, doing more than the original game designers would to with it. Thank you! I‚Äôve been playing Minecraft PE since 2011 and it‚Äôs awesome! But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do. "

There is a glitch if you are running and you watch a video for a med kit or a gernade then you can‚Äôt die, I think this works because you can‚Äôt get damaged while running. And I would recommend you do this glitch in survival mode. Just go into a corner and hold backwards turn around and kill them when they come to you. And you can‚Äôt kill your self with your own gernades if you do this glitch, I WOULD DO IT QUICK BEFORE IT GETS PATCHED! Loving the game, would like them to introduce some male playable characters sometime, but other than that it's got solid gameplay mechanics! Characters play differently giving a fresh feeling to the gameplay and the story is the too shabby either. Co-op could use some fine-tuning. Hey guys.This game was fun to play and I liked the story mode. I think the company (Chinese origin) did well with the English as their second language! The dialogues, characters were interesting for an app game. The gameplay was smooth, but every time you get to a menu-option (cutting wires, guessing codes, even options menu) the screen would bug-out and it wouldn‚Äôt register your touches to navigate (skip an ad, watch an ad to revive, quit to the main menu). It made the game ultimately unplayable for me personally and I ended up uninstalling it out of frustration. If they fixed this I would consider reinstalling. Disappointing as their latest updates claim to have ‚Äúfixed bugs‚Äù, since this one literally made it so I had to continuously clear the app and reboot it every time it froze.

Squeeze until you get all the oodles and cheesy goodness out. If you like ASMR videos, this one takes the cake! - Blackhead Cluster. What's better than one blackhead? A cluster of them! No need to scratch; just squeeze the small ones first and then work on the bigger blackheads. It's a party! - Scab. Scratch it off in the same direction.  - MEGA Iceberg. Squeeze until you get that sucker out! - MEGA Whitehead. You want to keep squeezing until the bar reaches the green portion, and keep it in that range until the pus comes out. Smooth, easy strokes are good!  - MEGA Blackhead Cluster. Well, it's a blackhead cluster, but so so many more of them! LOL - MEGA Tar Toothpaste. Oh, this one is a doozy! First squeeze to get the tip loose, then use your finger to pull downwards until the length is out. Keep repeating until you're done! 4 out of 5 dentists will scream when they see this pimple!  - MEGA Crater. Clear the reddish outline of the opening by swiping outwards with your fingers. After that, squeeze to loosen the mega kernel and push upwards with your finger a few times until it's completely dislodged.  More pro tips! * Can't find a pimple?

I am here to report a bug in the daily rewards quest. When you receive the quest, it forces you to do it when you get it. I didn‚Äôt find this as much of a problem, until when I click on the shop and bonus tabs and find that I can‚Äôt scroll. It also keeps telling me to click on the bonuses tab after I already did. Please fix this issue, as I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling, and nothing seems to work. You can‚Äôt control your sub, you can‚Äôt upgrade, and even after running out of oxygen it still doesn‚Äôt work. I would love to keep playing, but this bug makes it impossible. I like the idea of having a submarine and exploring a post apocalyptic ocean, but I just feel like it‚Äôs should be a full priced game that you pay for up front instead of the needless amount of micro transactionsIn this game. A very large amount of the screen if covered with menus that take up way to much space. This being a free to play micro transaction festival of course has to have a ‚Äúspin the wheel for a prize‚Äù game in which it works like any other game of this form, but after you spin it it will have a little notification in the menu that takes you the wheel. The thing is once you press the spin button you instantly get bombarded with an ad. This wouldn‚Äôt bother me so much if the in game store was bearable. There is this mechanic where you collect resources and sell them for coins. It sounds great but there is a sell all button which seems nice, but no it kicks you straight to the membership store and asks you to buy a membership to sell all of your stuff at once. Remove membership and clean the screen a bit and you might have yourself a pretty decent game. This has all of the essentials of a would-be great idle adventure. HOWEVER, eventually you start collecting six or more varieties of resource, call them gems, but can only hold a finite amount of those gems.  To upgrade the amount you can hold, you need to collect, say, 200k of two of those six resources. But if you get too many of one of the resources you won‚Äôt be able to hold enough of another resource that you need. The solution? You need to sell the resources that are overburdening your storage hold (which you probably need to upgrade that hold). Surely you can just sell a few to make room, right? Nope! You must sell them all (of that particular resource) and start over.So if you decide to go truly idle at any point, you wind up with too many of one resource and have to start over for no logical reason. There is an easy fix: the ability to sell some, but not all, of any given resource. Without that fix, the game just feels counter-intuitive, not very fun, and certainly not an idle.

Like a lot of the player base, their are some valid criticism. The servers, although recently greatly improved still seem very unstable and unpredictable in certain moments. The matchmaking can pair wildly different level of players, but in my opinion that keeps queue times lower which I‚Äôm okay with. My main criticism is the lack of detailed information on the dice numbers and mechanics. I think players should be able to see the effects and numbers of dice in more in depth ways. For example, what is the actual value of one 3-dot die compared to three 1-dot die? I have been able to deduce that there are big diminishing returns when you start to combine dice but I would like to know the values. I think this would advance the PvP scene and make players feel more skilled than luck. Thanks for the game! Let me start this off this game is really fun, however in the regular PVP match making the game puts you against someone around the same rank as you. This feature I really enjoy, but on the Co-Op mode most games it will pair you up with someone who is rank one or two. This is very frustrating because most of the time these players don't know how to play and in my opinion it ruins this gamemode. (I get the message you guys are trying to send tho) However, if someone puts the time into actually playing your game and is actually working hard to get to the higher ranks then I‚Äôm sorry but they should not need to deal with less experienced players. Also if it is possible to add a ‚Äúleave game‚Äù option because sometimes in co op you get people who will make you solo run it and this is very frustrating. If it is possible please make the boss and the timer align. It is very frustrating when I lose a game because the timer is at 00:00 and a boss is not spawning. That‚Äôs all, I look forward to seeing these changes and having overall a more enjoyable experience in the game. Thank you for your time, and have a great day. ü§ô PLEASE DEBUFF THE COMBO DIE. It completely carries people through games to the point where nothing can beat it. The game is a ton of fun, to the ppl who are saying there isn‚Äôt strategy, y‚Äôall need to get good. It‚Äôs all very aesthetically pleasing, and the pacing is alright. However. Too many of the dice are not nearly powerful enough to see any play. This makes arena more annoying than fun. In a similar vein, the typhoon dice just CARRIES people through arena. It‚Äôs absolutely busted, please nerf it. Also growth and summoner are a tier above basically any other dice purely based on how much SP they put you ahead by in the late game. Please make the legend dice easier to find/acquire. There are so many of them that it doesn‚Äôt make sense for them to be SO rare, and unless you already have some, getting to a high enough rank to get more/better ones is basically impossible, which means that you put together the best 5 dice you have and grind and grind and pray you open a legend, which gets too repetitive to be fun. And even then, there are good legends (blizzard, typhoon, joker) and terrible ones (supplant, hell, gun, holy sword, just to name a few). On that same note, mirror match needs to not be more expensive than the reward. Every single time someone enters a mirror match, the overall amount of gems among all players decreases, and that‚Äôs not cool, it makes it harder to progress. "

I have significant anxiety, and somehow just watching the game physics and the slow shift of the colors is incredibly relaxing. Which isn‚Äôt to say that I never tap. At many times I do, but this game wonderfully prevents the wrist pain that other apps have caused me with the requirement of extremely quick repetitive motion. Being able to just hold the spot you wish to tap is wonderful, and I thank you!I have two suggestions. One, that this app could prevent my phone from entering the sleep state as some other apps do. I‚Äôd rather not change my phone‚Äôs settings just when using one particular app, and I‚Äôd really love to watch the physics/colors for longer without the darkening of my screen startling me out of my relaxing state. Second, I wish there were further color options for the dots. The ads that led me to this app used dark blue and violet, colors of which I‚Äôm quite fond. I realize you most likely left these out for the legibility of the black text, and perhaps a text color swap past a particular dot color value/dot completion percentage might not be entirely trivial. But it might be nice to have a slider in a settings menu for selecting the starting and ending colors.Kudos on the app! The game is very easy to understand and is a good time waster, I like the idel games because they have no point other than to make money and start over to make money faster the next time. Which is called prestige in most of the games. It‚Äôs super cool and I totally recommend this game if you don‚Äôt mind the adds( in other peoples reviews they say they pop up every 5 seconds‚Äîand that is not a true statement‚Äî, if they have a problem with it delete the game and don‚Äôt write a review.) I don‚Äôt usually leave a review because nobody really looks at them and they don‚Äôt tell me what the game is about they tell me about other peoples opinions on how good/ bad the game is. Which is fine but if they don‚Äôt have autocorrect or an education enough to get their facts right they shouldn‚Äôt be saying anything. I gave the game 4 stars because it‚Äôs a good game but there is always room for improvement on everything, if everyone got a gold star first try there would be no improvement in the world. The ads are not a big of a deal just cause you keep collecting money think that it always gives you ads it doesn't always give you ads and also think of the developers if they made this game free they wouldn't be able to get money! The ads are fine for me the boosters are okay and everything else is ok now tell me what's the problem of getting so much ads I don't have a problem with those. Plus you should also buy the Remove Ads to not get ads. It will also support them now Goodbye! Edit 1: I almost forgot don't collect your money then if you think there's too many ads just wait until it's like 10 Million (I'm not forcing you to wait I'm just telling you could stop for a while of collecting your money) and also people Edude 42 is right how would they make money they need ads or either they could just make the game cost money. Oh and also if the things are not called money I'm sorry their probably called points actually. Plus the ads are very short. And final you can skip the ads did you guys not realize that? And also you know this doesn't need internet connection so play with no internet so you get no ads easy mode! But I play with connection just to support the creator. "

But instead of combat, this is a racing game, a replacement for the now-defunct Breitling Reno Air Racing game. The flight controls and feel will be familiar to those who've played Storm Raiders. I could do without the power-up balloons, and wish it had realistic pylons instead of HUD-like markers, but it seems like a great compromise between sim and game. Highly recommended! This game is a great Air racing game. I love how the creators based it off of sky gamblers. Get storm raiders first before this.Update: I only have four stars because I was able to beat the game in less than a week and get all the planes. There is no one on multiplayer. There needs to be more leagues of races. There is nothing left to do. Also add more planes. A jet division would be nice. Other than that it is great. "

I‚Äôve been taking good care of my crush other than the random bad dates. Only problem is the game won‚Äôt let me progress. It switches back and forth between saying we are dating and living together and will usually just result to telling me we are dating and need to connect for 0 more days and I need to get to level 7 but they‚Äôre both checked off. I‚Äôm at level 15. Sometimes I will complete achievements and there will be an exclamation point on the button, but when I click it there isn‚Äôt anything there to collect. I also have a problem with more often than not, when I ask them to tell me something, they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúOh, I know! So what do you think?‚Äù Without actually telling me anything. I‚Äôve also had them tell me things that aren‚Äôt even true, like being told they‚Äôre an Aries when they aren‚Äôt and then being tested on it the next day. Lastly, I‚Äôve completed missions and when they bring me a reward, it says I‚Äôve gotten a new collectible but I can‚Äôt see it, like it‚Äôs invisible. I‚Äôve also seen a lot of people mentioning something about a ghost James problem, but I haven‚Äôt had that happen yet personally. The game would be much more enjoyable if these bugs were to be fixed.Edit: What I assume is Ghost James has appeared, but it won‚Äôt let me do anything except click on him to open the interactions menu but not let me interact with him. I can‚Äôt open either of the top or bottom menus. I enjoy this game! And honestly I can see myself playing this game for a really long time. Plus the person I‚Äôm dating is super nice and it can teach you some things. But I payed $1 for the starter pack and it didn‚Äôt give me anything but it still took my money... I thought I was going crazy so I payed another $1 for diamonds and once again it took my money and didn‚Äôt give me anything... obviously this is a huge bug, it‚Äôs only $2 so I didn‚Äôt mind it as much but usually when I pay for stuff I kinda want the stuff I payed for... maybe fix some bugs please and I might consider buying stuff again. But besides that, this game has huge potential, it‚Äôs fun, I enjoy it, it needs a few more mini games and other additions but for what it is now, i think it‚Äôs a very cool and enjoyable game üíï Edit: I‚Äôve read the other reviews and i was scared, and today I went to check on my crush and I finally got this ghost named James. He is extremely creepy, and I turn off the lights and he doesn‚Äôt say anything!! I want my boyfriend back!! I REALLY don‚Äôt want to re-start because I finally maxed out my house, and I really liked my crush üò© please fix this game, this game can be really good, amazing even!

The game is actually easier to control than on PC, but that doesn't actually make things any easier. This is a good thing, because awkward controls are half the fun.There is currently a bug that erases your achievements every time you close the app, and it would be cool to see more surgeries added from the PC version, but neither issue is a deal breaker (and, more importantly, this can be addressed in a future update).This game is awesome, and well worth the money. I am using a mobile device and the app will not work. When opening the app up it had showed a tutorial section. It had me first move the screen which I did and it worked; then it moved to dragging items around and that was when the app  started having some problems because if you drag the item the app doesn‚Äôt realize that so you are stuck on that.I had reported the problem to Apple explaining what was wrong and asking for a refund but instead they said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt qualify for a refund‚Äù so I have an app that doesn‚Äôt work and I won‚Äôt get money back cause I don‚Äôt qualify.

At first glance, I thought ‚ÄúOh. Another low-quality game,‚Äù but I downloaded it anyway because it looked kinda interesting and at the time I presumed it to be a CSGO surfing knock off that I wanted to poke fun at. I started the game, and was not impressed. The character model looked atrocious, the interface looked unappealing, and the first map I started looked like it was designed in Roblox. But when I began playing, I was instantly hooked, and still am today. Gameplay is addicting, intense, and actually requires a considerable amount of skill to master in manipulating your speed and jump distance. Shortly after starting to play I grew to appreciate the aesthetic of each level, and I found the ‚Äúcrude‚Äù textures charming. Today, a lot of things have been improved significantly, making the game‚Äôs look compliment the amazing gameplay better. I think everyone should give this game a try. A ton of levels with varying degrees of difficulty and themes. Gameplay that is a massive amount of fun and requires skill to master. An enjoyable CSGO-style crate system. This game is one of the best mobile apps I‚Äôve ever played. This app is really fantastic!! I love the beats of the music and how the graphics are cool. The best part about this app is that it is real smooth!! But, there is some problems that I hope you guys fix. One problem I hope you guys fix is that when you die and go on a ad, after the ad and when you press checkpoint it is very ‚Äúlaggy‚Äù which causes you to easily lose the level. There is another which is that some levels can be IMPOSSIBLE! There some that are very tricky, but I don‚Äôt push it against the wall though. Another is that when you are trying to play multiplayer with family, it doesn‚Äôt show what you want and I remember there was only two private multiplayer lobbies, and nothing else on multiplayer. I would also like it if you get to switch genders. I am not being sexist, but I want atleast some girls, cause there is girls who also play this game. I would also like if there was a button to put away your knife or gun in single player. It would be easier to focus on the level you are on. But besides that, this game deserves to have 5 stars because I really like this game!!                                        üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü When I try to start Go Bhop to start playing, it says new update is available. When I press it to go to the App Store, it says cannot connect to store. I tried to search it up and when I do it says there is no update other than the one 2 weeks ago. I have tried closing the app and restarting it but that didn‚Äôt work at all. I also restarted my iPad which also didn‚Äôt seem to help at all. I have received the update on my phone(Android) and it seemed to work better. Please fix this. When it is, I will rate 4 star. The other problems I have encountered is that there is a level that has a triangle which freezes your controls making it impossible. Also, the cases I have a problem with. I buy an elite case and I get 5 coins. This has happened on my Samsung way too much. I feel like the cases should only have skins instead of the majority of slots being coins. It may have something to do with not having much skins out yet, but please find out a way in order to help the cases improve. Lastly, on my Samsung I can‚Äôt disable my hands. I prefer my screen with no hands at all in order to see the platforms. I would love this game if all those issues were fixed. Please and thank you. Btw if all these get fixed you guys definitely deserve a 5 star. Maybe even higher. "

Only that I can‚Äôt because of the fuel system, but that‚Äôs okay I play usually at night when I get a free hour so that‚Äôs not bad. My main issue with the game is the load times and the consistency with the ads and rewards. A lot of times I‚Äôll watch an ad to claim a free reward and it won‚Äôt give me it so I have to restart the game and watch another ad, same thing with the missions, I‚Äôll have to restart and claim it again, other than that I wish it would load faster, not sure if that‚Äôs even possible but it‚Äôd be nice. Now, I love the units in this game, I like the grind to unlock the epics and upgrade units, I enjoyed the eastern front campaign but I felt it was too easy, on the western front I am about halfway through but I am stuck on the level with all the tigers, and I feel like the western campaign is too hard if you could just rebalance them make the Soviet one a bit harder and the US one a little easier I would love the campaign. One other thing I wish was in the game would be a British campaign and units, and who knows maybe in the future you expand the game to PC with all sides of the war, maybe even a naval campaign, maybe I‚Äôm getting too exited. Overall I really enjoy this game and if you just polished it and added more armies I would even pay money for this game, keep it up! I‚Äôve tried what seems an infinite amount of battle simulators on the App Store, but this one tops all the others. I love the the little introduction before each campaign mission. It shows that you guys don‚Äôt just want to make another World War II game, but share the history behind that war. The struggles and the triumphs of both sides. It‚Äôs refreshing to the German point of view, not just a one sided version of the entire story. You tell WHAT‚ÄôS happening as much as you tell WHY it‚Äôs happening, which is incredible, and essential if you want to re-tell historical events. The camera is simple to move and it‚Äôs easy to navigate across the whole map. The units all have different strengths and weaknesses. One of the problems I had with some of the other simulators I played was the units were too similar it abilities, but this game does that right. I can see that so much love was put into this game. BUT... the strategy is lacking. I wish I could manually move my units, or go in slow motion so I would have more time to move them. I would also like to be able to order them to halt, which would be very useful in a lot of situations. And one more thing: PLEASE NERF THE GERMAN ROCKET LAUNCHERS OR BUFF THE USA/USSR‚ÄôS EQUIVALENT!And one question for the developers: Do you have any plans to add more factions/campaign levels? I would appreciate a response.That‚Äôs it! Good job on this game, and keep the updates coming! Thank you so much for your productive feedback. We are very happy that you perfectly understand our intentions. Originally we had a German Campaign but our War game advisors advised to not really mess with it for the sake of the game. We do agree that some units need to be buffed cor better balance and your feedback really helps us get it right. We are actually working on different ways to make the units hold position. We are a little stuck at this moment because it seems to make the controls way too complicated for playerd to enjoy. We are also working on larger maps which could improve the different variety of simulations. Also we just wanted to let you know that we are listening. :)  This is my first ever review, but as this game is fairly new I thought I would make one. Anyways, in my opinion the game was really fun, there‚Äôs a custom mode where you can just do any unit against any unit and sandbox mode where you can build levels and play other peoples levels. There‚Äôs an entire campaign which I‚Äôm only 27 percent through there‚Äôs a Western front and an Eastern front so it‚Äôs almost like getting two separate campaigns. My only problem is fuel, which is used to actually play levels you get either 4 or 5 fuel before there‚Äôs a time limit before you receive more. This doesn‚Äôt apply to custom mode though, so you can just keep doing match after match there. If you don‚Äôt want to wait to get more fuel you can always watch an add to get more, and this isn‚Äôt one of those games where if you click on something a random add will appear. There is also a daily crate you can open which usually gives me 3 hours of unlimited fuel, so that‚Äôs definitely nice about this gameSo far I‚Äôve had a pretty good experience and would love to see what update are in store for the future. If there‚Äôs anything I hope they add is more strategic maps in custom and sandbox mode, where it isn‚Äôt just two forces on the left and right side of the screen like some of the campaign missions. This is definitely one of the best battle simulator games I‚Äôve ever played. It‚Äôs really thanks to players like you leaving very productive and honest feedback that really really motivates us to do better. Accordingly, we have changed the custom mode playable without gas (ver 1.0.2) and we also reduced the waiting time to 10mins. We will bring on the more complicated features, first we are going to make a mode where the units can be holdable which would make things more tactical. Eventually we think we are going to need a larger map.  "

Driving a helicopter is even more complicated than a plane, but once you master it you can enjoy the wonderful flight of a helicopter. Your helicopter is equipped with machine guns, missiles that veer toward the enemy, and the incredible ray weapon. Destroy aircraft, enemy helicopters, antiaircraft, ground targets, vehicles in movement. See how they fall in flames when they are destroyed by your powerful helicopter. Go through 45 fun levels of increasing difficulty.  The first 15 levels you can select camera, the 15 following the camera is fixed on the roof of a skyscraper,  which increases the difficulty, but the hardest thing is to complete the last 15 levels,  in which you operate the helicopter from the jeep in movement.  If there are too many enemies and your life is low, you must use evasive tactics to complete level. Wide variety of cameras: From the rooftop, behind, behind closer, from within and from the jeep in movement. Move between buildings, taking care not to collide with the blades. Total freedom of movement around the city, mountains and rural areas. Recreation of several real buildings. You can write a message on the banner of the helicopter. Graphics configurable to play fast on all devices.  Challenge: Get land on the roofs of the narrow skyscraper and observe the movement of the city at your feet. Only for advanced pilots. Greater Challenge: Get land on a rooftop handling the helicopter from another rooftop or from the jeep in movement. RC Helicopter 3D is a game that can give you great satisfaction once you master it.  Landing a helicopter on the roof of a skyscraper at the first attempt is a joy, makes you feel proud of yourself.

What about after that? Another idea would be add levels or something. Perhaps using less controls in the early ones to all of them later, and then give us something to do. Since it's RC maybe spy on friends house or rescue a kitten in a tree - something. After that 5 all the way. Thanks much. It's a great game because you get to fly around and land on stuff along with the option of purposely crashing. However, there isn't really a point and it gets old. Maybe if you could change cities and helicopters, it would be my favorite game on my iphone. Needs more levels, remove kamikaze helicopters, needs to be able to select different helicopters and be able to select how many opponents you go up against. Add medivac/rescue level. Needs a base so you can refuel,add armory, and repair. Add troop/cargo transport. Add radio communications with Forward command ""Simulated"". Improve radar, defense, and weapon systems. "

The graphics are great and you get a good selection of jets you are able to fly anywhere in the world. I‚Äôm no physicist or a pilot, but you don‚Äôt have to be one to remember Newton‚Äôs 1st Law: ‚ÄúAn object that is in motion will stay in motion unless an external force acts upon it. An example of this is when a jet goes into a stall. It doesn‚Äôt pull a Coyote and Roadrunner stunt and just stop on a dime and fall out of the sky. It still has some forward momentum and glides down as it slowly descends. It also means that upon landing the nose doesn‚Äôt smack down on the tarmac as soon as the back wheels touch down. If you watch a plane coming into land, you will notice that the pilot keeps the nose up as long as possible and then, after 500 feet, they slowly ease the nose down and TOUCH the front wheel to the tarmac. One thing that would help with this is if you had the AOA right on the planes.One other minor thing that needs fixing is the fact that you can‚Äôt see the water on the map setting while in flight.One jet you should add is the F-15 Strike Eagle Alright, hands down this is the best flight sim out there. However, it's gotten really flat since you can't really engage in combat. UPDATE:( well after finding out that air fighter is now a subscription I don't know what to think about rortos anymore) I spent money to buy the pro so I wouldn't have to worry about having to purchase new upgrades when new things came out. I saw that the basic ""air carrier landings"" has gotten a recent update with a new aircraft. Fortunately you need to buy all the aircraft if you want them. Meanwhile the pro version still has not been updated for almost a year now. What a shame. I was really loving rortos but looks like you guys have followed along other corporates... The graphics are phenomenal, the list of aircraft to choose from is superb but the physics of flight is just not right! Granted I am no aerodynamic engineer (YET) but I do happen to know quite a bit about airplanes and how they fly. So I will cut right to the chase. Problem One, the decent/accent rate is off based on the AOA. Now I won't go into any mathematics but an experienced flyer can clearly see that it is off. So PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE in future updates (sooner rather than latter) correct this problem by, 1 making the stall speeds much lower, 2 allow for aircraft decent even when the nose is pitched up at high degrees, and 3, when landing allow the user to EASE the nose onto the tarmack. Currently the game is programmed to slam the plane into the ground the second it touches down. So please correct that and all that I have mentioned for optimal realism! "

I'm not easily entertained but this game keeps me satisfied for hours (wish it was the same to the villagers) Don't get me wrong,I love challenging but...this game's super hard! I sit there for days trying to figure out things! Meanwhile,my villagers are starving! Wish the algae would come later in the game,not the first day. That's why i only gave this game 4 stars. It's difficulty may too much. I'm sure some people may agree. I know there's an option where u can change the difficulty but it doesn't help much. Please dumb it down! I liked playing these games on my computer and finally decided to start playing them on my iPhone. I passed the original virtual villagers in less than a week without a restart because I had previously beaten it. What I don‚Äôt like about any of the other virtual villagers games going forward is the the original/first lets you buy ‚Äúboosters‚Äù of help like 2x tech point, buying tech point and food. I know everyone isn‚Äôt always about pay for a game but without any sort of help on the 2nd and 3rd games I‚Äôve had to restart numerous times. I also have the issue with when I go to pause it, it doesn‚Äôt actually pause and all my villagers die overnight. Please fix these issues so I don‚Äôt have to cheat and look up help online to try to move to the next game! I love the virtual villagers series, it's honestly one of my favorite games ever created, and this version happens to be my favorite out of the series, I love everything about it. But I can no longer play it :( the mobile version has some lag with the scrolling, and the most crucial bug is that when you select to pause the game, it doesn't actually pause. Which makes all your villagers starve and die. Last day of work, I don't know if you actually read the reviews on your games, but if you do, please please fix the bugs in your virtual villagers games so I can play them again, I'd really appreciate it :) "

I saw it on Facebook and I never download them but it showed how well it was rated in the App Store so I knew it had to be something legit. Gave it a try and now I‚Äôm addicted to it. There isn‚Äôt really too much I would change to the game other than being able to see ground level and have more control over what happens to the population. As far as what the game is, terraforming a planet, they did an amazing job. I‚Äôm sure you can control more but on the basic difficulty level (I highly recommend to start with) you can control the temperature, oxygen, pressure, plant life, money, population size. Everything is highly sensitive. Finding a balance takes time. This is a game that won‚Äôt take up too much time at once. You might only play this game a couple times out the day but it‚Äôs necessary to check in on your planet every once in a while. Random events and scenarios happen to the population and the planet which I really love. From a meteoroid on track to hit you, to the population finding a great athlete to honor amongst them. It gives the game a story. You have to make a decision when those things happen immersing you into the game even more. And of course Every action has a reaction. The main task of this game is finding that balance. I‚Äôm so glad I found this game. The space nerd in me is ecstatic! I highly recommend!!! I rarely write reviews, but this game was so well-designed and enthralling that I felt that I had to do so. The graphics are stunningly beautiful and this game has consumed my attention since I downloaded it. It gives you the option to watch advertisements to gain currency, culture, and ‚ÄúGenesis Points,‚Äù which allow you to build faster, but offers the option in a very inobtrusive way, unlike so many games with obnoxious ads. I watch them occasionally to speed things along and support the developers. I also purchased Genesis Points because I love this game so much I felt obliged to pay something. At this rate, I‚Äôll likely purchase the options to terraform other planets and moons as well. This is a game that is truly enjoyable without spending a cent or watching a single ad, though, and that can be won simply with some patience‚Äî which you‚Äôll need anyway! I love the educational aspect and basis in science, and with just the most basic math and science abilities, you‚Äôll enjoy this game as well. I‚Äôm looking forward to the next planets and moons already. I also loved the book recommendations in the information section! The developers clearly prioritized the quality of the game and educational aspect over making a quick profit. I hope others purchase the optional moons, planets, and GP so the team can keep working on this game and more like it. This is the best I‚Äôve played on iOS to date. I‚Äôve been playing this game on and off for two years and it never gets old, and there are plenty of world to play with. If you‚Äôre playing with a simple developing biosphere you can terraform a moon/planet in 4-5 days without spending any real money for in-game boosts (called Genesis Points or GP), 2-3 of you do buy these boosts. If you play with a biosphere you can fine tune it‚Äôs definitely more of a challenge and terraforming this way might take you 4-5 days with boosts, a week or a little longer without. WATCHING ADS IS COMPLETELY OPTIONAL, YOU WILL NEVER BE FORCED TO WATCH AN AD üôåüèª (putting that in all-caps because ad trap games are everywhere these days) but watching the offered ads gives you bonuses to your income and even 1-3 GP sometimes. Watch enough ads and you could have income bonuses for days (literally). Random positive and negative events that can affect your income, structures, organisms, or culture keep you on your toes if you leave the game open, but you don‚Äôt have to worry about bad events happening while the game is closed and the terraforming continues when closed, so this game is great for people who don‚Äôt want to have to play all the time to succeed. The game can also be paused so you don‚Äôt have to worry about letting things go for too long and accidentally destroying your progress. Graphics are pretty and the game runs smoothly. Definitely earned my 5 star rating! "

And bad results should make players want out or play badly. The Association should be the focus of the game, not the campaign. More clashes, more cups, more man-vs-man games would be a very welcome change. Premiums for the association events should be much better.Hall of Fame players should be harder to get. Fame grows quickly and independent of performance. Only the Top 10 should be the Top 10, you know?It is unclear the relationship between player styles and performance on the field. A box-to-box CMF runs into the goalkeeper to score while the hole-player AMF stays put 20m behind. What sense does this make?There is no use for players with 1-3 stars. No one uses them. No one wants them because higher quality players are way too easy to acquire. This looks like you are using the big names as a bate to keep the clients playing. But it is unrealistic and disregards the fact that many of us live outside UEFA area and like smaller clubs and simple players. Again, make the big stars really hard to get, and the game will be much more realistic.Thanks! I have been playing this game since it came out. The new update didn‚Äôt help at all. It might have fixed some things but made everything else worse honestly. The finishing just got worse and the GK can‚Äôt even save any shots on target. The defense got ridiculous no matter what team you play  that team will still score on you even if you have the best defense. Players still running away from the ball instead of coming to it, slow pass to other players and stupid turns for no reason. Players taking their sweet time to control a slow pass. A player blast the ball when one on one situation, Players making unnecessary passes A team that has a lower overall than higher team like 990 will lose 856 overall team that‚Äôs bs to be honest. I don‚Äôt know what exactly you guys fixed on the update but you guys need to look at it again. The game used to be fun and enjoyable but that‚Äôs changing with the update. The fact there is people like me who spent money to play this game but losing to a weaker is not fair at all. Also, the new update made the game play slower. No matter how many times you change tactics or formation the team will still suffer due the update. The new update is totally ruining the fun out of this game. The game literally looks fake with this new update. Players look really weird. Plays look unrealistic and fake. Please fix this issues for us. Frustrating frustration and more frustrating frustration on top of another frustrating frustration and yet another frustrating frustration and frustrating you forever and ever and ever and so on. Well, nowadays they (K o n a m i) managed to put back together actually a quite high quality produc... produce, I have to say, I guess. It glitches some people (like me), depriving them from, say, getting normal things that other players get without any problem. Like a daily trainer scout (for watching ad). Or a sharing task, to get few coins. Or... what about CPU customarily break bones of my players, sometimes forcing me play with 10 players left (because subs were already done), and guess what. CPU NEVER GETS A RED CARD. Amazing, just like real life VAR in England‚Äôs PL today. Or user players more often than not will screw their Free kicks and penalties. Guess what about CPU?

It‚Äôs slow, it has a very simplicit√©s and not well sorted or labeled home screen, and it does not thoroughly tell you how to do things that you unlock during the game, such as long term contracts.

This isn‚Äôt a big deal by itself because you can always switch between the options later, but this brings me to my next point:B) You have to watch an ad every time you want to switch to a different option for a design feature. My grievance is not with the ads themselves (I understand they are a necessity to allow for free game play) but rather the fact there is no option to pay a fee to remove the ads. That is, unless of course there is and I have not found it yet. If that‚Äôs the case, then my grievances are no longer and I would rate this app 5 stars. This game is fun and can be challenging at times but there‚Äôs many challenges going that allow you to win boosts to pass the level. My only complaint is the ads I know it‚Äôs a free game and I‚Äôm thankful for that but the ads are getting out of hand. I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs the same for everybody else but for me every time I lose or win a level it takes me to an ad instantly and you have to watch it in order to get your coins, you also have to watch an ad if you want to change your design. In order to improve this game the app developer should put ads every three or four levels and not on every single level you play and they should allow the option to preview the designs you want to buy like many other interior design games with puzzle allows you to. But overall this is a good app just the ads are getting out of hand and the option to not preview your choices is annoying. I‚Äôve been playing for a few months. The game itself is fun and I enjoy the challenges. I‚Äôve won second and first place in a few challenges! And MOST of the levels are easier to get through than some other similar games (even tho they are not without challenging levels). The reason I refuse to give more than 3 stars is because multiple times the game has totally screwed me over. I just paid 190 diamonds to get a barrel bomb and color ball and it didn‚Äôt even show up in the level. I watch patterns drop where I should be getting TNT or bombs from it and get NOTHING. The game glitches in the middle of a level so I have to shut it down and lose a life that I shouldn‚Äôt have. Sometimes I lose a life and the level doesn‚Äôt even open at all. The glitches and, dare I say *cheating* the game does throughout playing is infuriating. I  only gave three instead of two stars because the rooms are fun to design and it is easier game play than something like Matchington Mansion that became more painful than playful... but this is teetering on the edge and if things aren‚Äôt fixed I‚Äôll be deleting it soon.

Hope you have a good day. XOXO I love to escape by reading stories where I put myself into the characters I‚Äôm reading about. It‚Äôs a great way to escape what I‚Äôm feeling in Terms of my health both mind & body. I‚Äôm sort of broken myself & reading takes my mind off of the difficulties I face everyday. Unfortunately I cannot afford to pay for a membership due to my health, I‚Äôm not working & don‚Äôt have the means for frivolous luxuries. But I wait the hour & then I read my stories. Thanks for making me feel better reading the stories that take me away. Ellen D. I love the graphics and design. The stories are great but I wish they could have done vampires stories. Also the gems are very high compared to other apps. Right now Chapters is the best story app. They offer VIP membership and you get discounts for finished stories. I‚Äôm reading a finished story and paying 17 gems for a choice and 30 gems for outfits. And this is throughout the game. I wish the gems wasn‚Äôt so expensive. Not to mention you only receive 1 gem for completing a chapter. This app has the potential to be amazing. Very expensive though and lack of variety. "

The houses need to be cheaper and you could have a house tour before you actually get the house that would make more sense or a realtor. Other than that the game is so nice love it.

‚ÄéMystic Messenger,"""Downloading an messenger app will lead to chatting with hot guys!?""

Here's a secret: you don't need 100% everyday to get a route. 75% is enough to suffice (about three chat rooms being missed). So the chat rooms you miss at the early hours in the morning (about two/three chat rooms usually) are fine. The game is time dependent but unless you don't have notifs on, missing chat rooms during the day shouldn't be a big deal as they come usually once an hour or once every two hours. However, if you're actively social/have a job/are in school, I wouldn't recommend this. I only play MM during vacation breaks or summer vacation to get the most out of it, which doesn't seem like a lot, but each gameplay is a little over a week and there's only 7 characters so I find time.I find Cheritz extremely generous, and although Another Story is expensive, but if you save up (especially during the summer vacation special they're having atm) and only spend hourglasses on the minute things, the hourglasses pile up.The story and characters themselves are beautiful and I always laugh when I get the option to break the fourth wall.All in all, 20/10. I hope Cheritz releases more games in the future and that they're able to be played without time constraints so everyone can enjoy them because honestly, Cheritz is a genius. If I could give 10 stars, I would. I cannot believe I am just now leaving my review of Mystic Messenger. One day, In the summer of 2016, I was looking in the app store, tying to find a game that I would become obsessed with, trapped in the world, to love and appreciate every second I spent playing the game, since I really like to involve myself in phone games, especially otome. Then I came across Mystic Messenger. I had heard about it through a friend but never really bothered to download it. So thought to myself, ""Why don't we try it out.""I have never been so happy, and so pleased in my entire life. These next few lines I say are with not only physical emphasis, but more so with mental happiness. Mystic Messenger is not only an otome game, it will open your eyes up to your world around you. Yes you might be staring at your phone, but if you sincerely absorb, take in and process what each character struggles with and how they come to a realization within their personal world on how it affects them, you will by far feel lighter. Before I played MM, I was staring at the huge, towering wooden, double doors of Earth, but after playing a couple routes, specifically V's, I can see the full view and appreciate my Earth, and sun in a completely new way than before. this game not only brings tears to my eyes, but happiness to my heart, and for that I thank you, Cheritz.-Love, Piper üíï. okay this game is literally the best most emotional fun and just intriguing game ever. the only downside the the currency with the hourglasses doesn't i could only play the first free casual story. but let me just tell you i was hooked, throughout my day i'd make up times on when a group chat should open and check. i haven't done all the casual story routes i just finished yoosungs and honestly i don't think the other ones will compare üòé. the game made me feel loved happy and overall put me in a good mood anytime i got a notification from it. the emotional journey and the story, the little things like the emails and the guests you can invite, they make this game everything. when i tell you i was sobbing on the last day. I üëè WASüëè SOBBINGüëè! and honestly it hurts that i can't really do anything else and i'm so upset about that... i had managed to get 22 hourglasses when i finished so i bought an after ending thing and now i'm literally broke. i just wish we could unlock the other stories once we finished them one cause this is heart breaking :( i legit have an album on my phone full of photos and screenshots of things yoosung has said that had made my day and the photos he would send. i know i'm late to play it but i'm glad i gave this old game a chance, this game has literally changed my life for the better and i wouldn't have it any other way...
